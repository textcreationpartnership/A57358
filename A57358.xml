            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HY cheerful Acceptance of my former Endeavors in this kind for the Good of my Native Country, hath encouraged me, though with great Care, Labor, and Coſt, to preſent thee with the Learned, Judicious, and Worthily renowned <hi>Riverius</hi> his <hi>Practice of Phyſick.</hi> He is an Author now living, and ſufficiently known: And his Work will ſpeak for it ſelf, and praiſe him in the Gates.</p>
            <p>And if thou ſhalt ſhew a Friendly Countenance to this worthy Stranger, who now ſpeaks Engliſh, I ſhall be thereby encouraged by all other means to ſtudy to promote thy Good by bringing thee more acquainted with this, and other excellent Authors.</p>
            <p>And whereas ſome, either out of envy, or miſ-underſtanding, do condemn Works of this Nature, publiſhed in our Mother Tongue, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging chiefly, That ſuch Books encreaſe the number of Empericks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are a hinderance to learned and able Phyſitians; alſo occaſion ſome to hurt themſelves by raſhly practiſing on their own Bodies. I ſhall An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to theſe Objections in order.</p>
            <p>Firſt, as for Empericks: Theſe Books, and ſuch as theſe publiſhed in Engliſh, are ſo far from making more Empericks, that they will ſpoil thoſe that are, and make that we ſhall have fewer of them. For an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perick being one that gives Phyſick (Hab Nab, as wee uſe to ſay) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying only on Experience, and what he hath ſeen done before him, not being able to give any reaſon touching the Diſeaſe, its Cauſe, or Cure: Theſe Books will teach ſuch perſons how to go upon good grounds, and to be able to give a ſolid Reaſon for what they do, and of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks, make them Rational Phyſitians, if they be men of good Natural Parts, though they be ignorant of all Tongues but their Mothers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:49088:4"/>As for the hurt which is hereby pretended to be done to learned Phyſitians, it is a meer Imagination, and no learned Phyſitian that bethinks himſelf well, will ſo judg. For the uſe of theſe Books re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects chiefly the Poor of this Nation, together with Sea-farers, and Soldiers. But for the Rich that have Money to ſpare, and bide at home, no otherwiſe (in point of practice) than for an honeſt Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; and delightful Speculation. What rich man is there ſo mad, who reading a Chapter in theſe Books, and ſeeing what a world of Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and Cautions do belong to the knowledg and orderly Cure of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Diſeaſe, but will be more fearful than ever he was before to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himſelf to the Cure of any but a learned Phyſitian. Now it is not by the Poor, but by the Rich, that the learned Phyſitian maintains himſelf; the poor are but a trouble to him, only before ſuch Books as theſe were extant in the Engliſh Tongue, Conſcience (ſomtime) forced the learned Phyſitian to take care of the poor, becauſe the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned were wholly unable: whereas now there may be found Induſtrious men that know no more Languages than their Native one, who may in a rational way contribute to the Neceſſities of the Poor. Nay, theſe kind of Books are profitable to the learned Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians; for many of the Gentry, eſpecially of the Ladies and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women, viewing the ſtate of their own Bodies in ſuch Books as theſe (as in Looking-Glaſſes) will perceive certain Diſeaſes in themſelves, either now in being, or likely ere long to ſeize upon them, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they would never have ſo much as dream'd of; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon crave the Advice and Aſſiſtance of the learned Phyſitian.</p>
            <p>Alſo the Ladies and Gentlewomen being well read in ſuch Books as theſe, will better know how to demean themſelves towards their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, Children, or other Relations and Friends in their reſpective Sickneſs in point of ordering them, and will be more apprehenſive of the Phyſitians Directions, and ſo better able to practice them; alſo more capable of his Reaſons, and Prognoſticks, and ſo more confident and cheerfully obedient. All which wil very much advance the Cure, and conſequently the Honor and Gain of the learned Phyſitian: for as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> notes in his firſt Aphoriſm, <hi>It is not enough towards the Cure that the Phyſitian do what is fitting; but the by-ſtanders and friends of the Sick muſt play their part, or all will not be well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the third place, Whereas it is objected, That people reading theſe Books, will practice upon themſelves and hurt themſelves.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, If they do, they have none to blame but their own folly; for it is not the intent of the Publiſhers of theſe Books, that every one that can read Engliſh, ſhould dare to take, of their own Heads, ſuch Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines as are deſcribed in the ſaid Books. But our intent is, That where
<pb facs="tcp:49088:4"/>
in the Country there is no learned Phyſitian at hand; at Sea, in the States and Merchants Ship, where the Chyrurgion is compelled to act both his own, and the Phyſitians part; In Armies and Leguers, &amp;c. an ingenious and diligent Chyrurgion, Apothecary, or any other that hath from his youth been exerciſed in theſe kind of ſtudies, and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant about the ſick, may attain ſuch a competent knowledg in the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Methodical Cure of Diſeaſes, as they may with honor to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and profit to the ſick (by Gods Bleſſing) ſupply the place of a more learned Phyſitian. For the uſe of ſuch perſons, theſe Books are intended, and for diligent Midwives; and not that every Fool ſhould turn Phyſitian, or that every Reader ſhould tamper with him or her ſelf.</p>
            <p>Alſo divers Honorable Ladies and Gentlewomen, that out of a truly Chriſtian and Charitable Diſpoſition have not diſdained, but counted it a great Honor to be helpful to the poor in the time of their ſickneſs, may by peruſal of theſe Books, and the like, confirm and encreaſe their knowledg, and become honorable Inſtruments in the Hand of God, of much relief and comfort to many poor diſtreſſed Creatures in their reſpective Countries and places of Habitation. For the worthy ſakes of which honorable Ladies and Gentlewomen in the firſt and chiefeſt place, and for the eaſe of all others unacquainted with the Greek and Latin Tongues, and conſequently unable to underſtand divers terms of Art, and other words drawn from the ſaid Tongues (which it was neceſſary to retain for brevity ſake, and to avoid tedious Circumlocuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) I have cauſed a <hi>Phyſical Dictionary</hi> to be added at the end of theſe Books, explaining all ſuch terms of Art aforeſaid, as are uſed therein.</p>
            <p>When the Reader meets in theſe Books, with the names of Simple or Compound Medicaments, and deſires a more full knowledg of them, let him have recourſe to the <hi>London Diſpenſatory</hi> in Engliſh, where he may be ſatisfied; for it had been an endleſs and vain work, to repeat what hath there been ſaid. If there occur accidentally the name of any Diſeaſe which the Reader would better underſtand, let him look into the Table of the Contents of the Chapters of theſe ſeventeen Books, and he ſhall find the Chapter intituled from that Diſeaſe; in the beginning of which Chapter he ſhall find the ſaid Diſeaſe deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed and explained.</p>
            <p>Alſo the Reader may pleaſe to take notice, That many hard phraſes in theſe Seventeen Books are explained in the Context, by more eaſie words following, which ſignifie the ſame with the foregoing hard word.

            <head>The Author to the Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Ifteen Yeers ago (Friendly Reader) to Satiſfie the Deſires of my Auditors, I undertook to explain unto them the Methodicall Cure of all inward Diſeaſes of the Body; which that I might accompliſh the ſooner, I medled not at all in a manner with the Theory, knowing ful well that any Student might with eaſe enough fetch the ſame from divers Authors: which notwithſtanding they could not ſo eaſily do in point of Practice, becauſe of the almoſt infinite Company &amp; variety of Medicaments, wherewith the Books of thoſe that have delivered the Practical part of Phyſick do ſwarm; with which Young Beginners are ſo confounded, that they remain amazed, not knowing which to chooſe. I conceived it would be moſt profitable for them, if out of ſuch a multitude of Medicaments, I ſhould ſelect the moſt choice, and which were moſt frequently uſed, and diſpoſe them into the ſame order which we are wont to obſerve in our Practice, when we attend the Cure of our ſick Patients.</p>
            <p>This Method of teaching, gave ſuch content to our Students of Phyſick, that as many as came flocking to this Univerſity to ſtudy, after that I had finiſhed the ſame, did all earneſtly deſire to have written Coppies thereof; and many of them did frequently exhort me, and earneſtly Beg, that I would ſuffer it to be printed; and ſo for the future free all Men from the tedious Labor of writing it out. But I, who never had the thought (being very free from Self-Love) that my writings were of ſo much worth, as to be publiſhed in Print, eſpecially this Method of Practice, which was ſlipt from me as a thing only begun with rude Notes, haſtily huddled up to perform my daily task of Reading, and half maimed for want of the Theoretick part: I thought it better to beleeve my own Conſcience than their too favourable Opinion. I pondered likewiſe in my Mind, that it was a very hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous thing, to ſubject my Reputation to the Judgment of the whol world, and (as it commonly falls out) to the biting Teeth of envious detractors; eſpecially in this poliſhed Age, abounding with neat and paſing fine Witts, who are hardly pleaſed with ſuch workes as have been wrought with the greateſt Induſtry poſsible, and who are wont to peep curiouſly to ſpy ſpots in the ſhining Sun. Nevertheleſs this unperfect Birth of mine; which I deſired to keep cloſe and hidden, was ſent into the wide world by one of my Schollers, who without my knowledg, and againſt my will, gave that imperfect, homely and unpoliſhed work to a Printer of <hi>Paris</hi> to print. And this Child of mine which I did count Abortive, was more pleaſing and found greater Favour in the Eyes of Strangers, than in its Fathers; for all the Books of this firſt Edition, were ſuddainly ſold off. A ſecond Edition, and a little after a Third was procured by the ſame Printer, by which all Europe was filled with Copies. Nevertheleſs, ſome yeers after, there came out three other Editions within two yeers time, one at <hi>Lions,</hi> and two other in <hi>Holland</hi> viz. at
<pb facs="tcp:49088:7"/>
               <hi>Tergow</hi> and the <hi>Hague</hi> In the mean while, I received very many Letters, out of the Chief Cities of <hi>FRANCE, GERMANY, HOLLAND,</hi> and <hi>ITALY,</hi> from Doctors of Phyſick, whom I was acquainted with, when they ſtudied Phyſick in this Univerſity; ſeriouſly expoſtulating, that this Work was Lame becauſe it wanted the Theory of the Diſeaſe, and withall adviſing me that it would be worth my pains, to ſpend ſome part of my ſtudies that way. Conceiving at length that it was fitting to conſent unto their juſt requeſts, I laboured with all my might as far as my Employments and Health would give me leave, to finiſh and publiſh this Theoretick part; inſomuch that at laſt (Bleſſed and Praiſed be God) I brought the ſame to a concluſion. Accept it (freindly Reader) with a cheerfull mind, being Joyned to the foreſaid Practick part, ſo that in one continued Diſcourſe thou maieſt Behold the <hi>Nature, Differences, Cauſes, Diagnoſtick,</hi> and <hi>Prognoſtick Signs,</hi> together with <hi>the Cure ofall Diſeaſes.</hi> I Suppoſe this Child of mine will merit highly thy Favour, being now adorned in all its parts, and advanced to a far greater Degree of Perfection; and ſeeing that thou wert pleaſed with it in its Cradle and Swadling-Clouts; now that it is greater and hath attained its perfect Stature of Body, it will not, I hope, Diſpleaſe thee. Enjoy it with Gods Bleſsing, and whatever thou ſhalt learn therefrom, let Chriſtian Charity cauſe the to employ it for thee Good of thy Neighbour. Alſo I deſire thee to take notice, that many faults were crept into the former Editions through the negligence of Printers, all which I have carefully corrected in this Edition. And furthermore, I have added many and thoſe very Choice Medicaments, to the Cures formerly printed, which will not a little conduce to the happy cure of difficult Diſeaſes. Forewel.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this our Treatiſe of Head-Diſeaſes, we ſpeak firſt only of thoſe which are in the ſubſtance of the Brain, and the Films which contain it: For although the Eyes, Ears, Tongue, Teeth, Gums, Jaws, and Pallat, go to the making up of the Head; yet we think it fit to ſpeak of their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes in ſeveral Books for better Method ſake; And to call the Diſeaſes of the Brain and its <hi>Meninges,</hi> or Films, by the name of <hi>Head-diſeaſes,</hi> moſt properly ſo from the excellency of the parts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are. Theſe come from the <hi>hinderance</hi> of the <hi>Action</hi> of the Brain, either in reſpect of <hi>Sence, Motion,</hi> or <hi>Nutrition.</hi> The Sence is divided into Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and External: The Internal hath the chief actions, as Imagination, Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Memory; as alſo Sleep and Waking: the Diſeaſes of which are, Frenzie, Madneſs, Melancholly, <hi>Catoche, Coma</hi> waking ſleep, and <hi>Coma</hi> long ſleep, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargie, <hi>Carus,</hi> Apoplexy. The External Sences are five, namely, Sight, Hearing, Smelling, Taſt, and Feeling: But becauſe the firſt four have their peculiar Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans or parts, which have divers Diſeaſes, which we ſhall treat of in ſeveral Books: We will in this Book lay down and declare thoſe which belong to the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49088:10"/>
ſence of Feeling, becauſe they come immediately from the Brain and its Membranes or Films diſturbed, and are either termed Palſies, which come from Sence deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or diminiſhed; or Headaches, which comes from Sence depraved. When the actions of the Brain are hindred in reſpect of motion, there ariſeth Convulſion, Falling-ſickneſs, Palſey, Apoplexy, Giddineſs, or ſwimming of the Head, called <hi>Vertigo,</hi> and Trembling: Finally, When the acting or working of the Brain is hurt or hindred in its <hi>Nutrition,</hi> or <hi>Nouriſhment,</hi> the Diſeaſe is either in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemperature, or diſorder of the excrement of the Brain, of which cometh a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrh, defluxion or diſtillation. We ſhall bring all theſe Diſeaſes under their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Heads and Chapters, in that order which is moſt uſual for the way of Cure: Therefore we ſhall firſt declare the Cold Diſtemperature of the Brain, and then all Diſeaſes that come from thence, becauſe the ground of their Cure is in the Cure of that. Afterwards we ſhall lay down the Diſeaſes that come from a Hot Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and Hot Humors; which will all more clearly appear in their ſeveral Chapters.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. 1.</hi> Of the Diſtemper of the Brain.</head>
                     <p>ALL Diſtempers are uſually divided into Simple, and Compound; Material, and Immaterial. Simple or ſingle Diſtempers are ſeldom ſeen; as alſo immaterial diſtempers, for they come from Primary Cauſes, and either vaniſh of their own accord, or with very ſmal Remedies or Medicines: But Material Diſtempers produce all the Diſeaſes of the Head; therefore we will fall cloſe to diſcourſe of them; which few Authors have done, in handling them ſeverally, becauſe in the laying down of the Diſeaſes which are produced of thoſe Diſtempers, they are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently explained. We therefore will transfer the handling of the Hot diſtemper of the Brain, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Moiſt and dry Diſtempers to the Chapters which contain thoſe Diſeaſes which are produced from them. But becauſe the greateſt number of Diſeaſes of the Head come from a Cold and Moiſt Diſtemper of the Brain, we thought ſit to diſcourſe of that by it ſelf in the beginning of this Treatiſe; that the Cure of that may be as the Foundation of the Cure of all Diſeaſes coming from thence, and that the Medicines may be found in this Chapter which appertain to the Cure of their Cauſe: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we will avoid the vain repetition of thoſe Diſeaſes, which is the Cuſtom of almoſt all Writers of Practical Phyſick, who by that means enlarge their Volumns, and make the Art more difficult and tedious to yong beginners.</p>
                     <p>The Cold Diſtemper of the Brain which is Compound and Material, or joyned with Matter, is for the moſt part wateriſh and moiſt; becauſe the Brain is that Mother of Moiſture or Flegm, and Coldneſs long abiding draws moiſture to it ſelf. For albeit ſomtimes it is joyned with a Melancholly Humor, yet that Humor is ſeldom begot in the Brain as Flegm is, but it is for the moſt part lodged in the <hi>Hypochondria,</hi> or Parts beneath the Ribs, and ſent from thence to the Brain, whereby moſt grievous Symptomes are produced.</p>
                     <list>
                        <head>The Cauſes of a Cold and Flegmatick Diſtemper of the Brain, are theſe:</head>
                        <item>1 Cold and moiſt Meats which eaſily turn into Flegm; and alſo in the time of their Concoction, by cooling the Stomach and the Liver too much, produce abundance of Flegm, which after is ſent up to the Brain.</item>
                        <item>2 Too great a quantity, not only of Meats which are too cold, but alſo of good and wholſom, which deſtroyeth the Natural heat, and begetteth Crudities.</item>
                        <item>3 Eating preſently after or before meat, and before the former meat is concocted; whence come many Crudities, which ſend Flegm to the Head.</item>
                        <item>
                           <pb n="3" facs="tcp:49088:10"/>4 The ceaſing of a Natural cuſtom of vomiting, or purging flegm; or the omitting the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of taking Purges, Sweats, Diureticks, or provokers of Urine, or omitting of accuſtomed Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe.</item>
                        <item>5 To be born of Parents troubled with a cold diſtemper of Brain.</item>
                        <item>6 Old Age, which by reaſon of the decay of Natural heat, produceth much Flegm: as alſo Youth by reaſon of Gluttony and diſorderly Diet.</item>
                        <item>7 A Cold and Moiſt dweiling, neer ſtanding Pools, Marſhes, Fens and great Rivers, open to the North winds, Snow and Rain.</item>
                        <item>8 Long and deep ſleep, eſpecially preſently after Meat.</item>
                        <item>9 A ſedentary idle life, without, or with too much Care, Study, or Sorrow, becauſe by diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Natural heat, eſpecially in the Brain, they make it cold.</item>
                        <item>10 To theſe may be added a hot and moiſt Liver, which ſends many Vapors to the Brain, which there condenſe or grow thick, and ſo turn into Flegm.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>The Signs of a cold diſtemper of the Brain, are taken eithr from the Cauſes above mentioned, by the prefence of which we may eaſily conjecture of the condition of the diſtemper; or they are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the effects of the diſtemper; which that they may be particularly examined and tried, we ſhall fetch from their Originals, namely, from Actions, Paſſions, Excrements, and Habit of the Body.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 The Animal Actions, which declare a cold Diſtemper of the Brain, are theſe; A heavy and dull Mind, a ſlow blockiſh Wit, an unfortunate Memory, a great inclination to ſleep, and long and deep continuance therein, except a Catarrh, or Defluxion, Pain of the Head, or Paſſions of the Mind do hinder it: Dreams of Coldneſs, of Waters, as Rain, Snow, Floods, Pools, Seas, and of white things A ſlowneſs and dulneſs of all the Sences: Slowneſs of Motion, yet continuance therein; becauſe groſs Spirits are more difficult to be diffuſed or diſſolved.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The Paſſions which declare a Cold Diſeaſes, of the Brain, are Cold Diſeaſes, as Palſies, Lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, Catarrh, or Defluxion, and many others, with which if the ſick party have been formerly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, we may well conjecture that he is ſubject to this diſtemper of a cold Brain. This will further appear if the ſick man be better in clear, hot, and dry weathr, than in cold, moiſt, winter, and rainy weather. Moreover, an often and plentiful ſending forth of ſnot and flegm from the Mouth and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils, is a clear demonſtration of abundance of cold Flegm and moiſture in the Brain.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 From the Habit of the Body, we may have ſigns both general and particular of this Diſtemper: The general Signs are taken from the whol Habit or Conſtitution; for if the whol Conſtitution be cold and moiſt, then without queſtion the Brain, which is moſt cold and moiſt of all other parts, is the ſame: Therefore a Skin which is cold, ſoft, ſmooth, and white; a Body ſoft and ſlow, not fleſhy, with ſmal veins, declare a cold conſtitution o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> temper. The particular Signs of a cold Brain are in the Head; as paleneſs of Face, no Veins to be ſeen in the Eyes, ſoft hair, ſmooth, and thin, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſlowly, red, and not curling, continuing the whol life without baldneſs; and when the Head is quickly offended with outward Cold, and refreſhed with Heat.</p>
                     <p>As to the Prognoſis, or Prognoſtical part concerning this Diſtemper; It is hard to be cured, and often produceth grievous Diſeaſes: that which hath been long breeding is moſt hard to be cured; that which is Natural, Hereditary, and from the Birth, is never to be cured; as alſo that which is in old folks, if it hath been of long continuance. Winter is not a ſit time for the Cure of this Diſtemper but Summer.</p>
                     <p>The Cure is wrought from two Indications or Intentions; namely by evacuating or diſcharging the flegm abounding, and correcting or qualifying the diſtemper of the Humor by its contraries, which muſt be done by Diet, Chyrurgery, and Phyſick.</p>
                     <p>The Diet muſt be hot and dry; and firſt make choyce of a pure Air, ſomwhat hot and dry, but not too hot, for that would diſſolve and powr forth the humors in the Head too ſoon, and ſo produce a diſtillation, and other diſeaſes which happen to thoſe who ſtay long in the Sun, or inflame their heads with too neer approach to the fire: The Air cannot be too dry, ſo it be temperate in its active qualities, but it had better be too hot than too cold.</p>
                     <p>Let not the Chamber of the ſick party be too little, too low, nor too moiſt or filthy, but open to dry winds which may paſs through: In moiſt, cloudy, cold times, the Chamber air may be altered with hot and ſweet Herbs ſtrewed upon floor; as Sage, Marjoram, Lavender, Roſemary, Tyme; or by bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſame, or other dry Woods, and eſpecially Juniper: let the fire be cleer, and ſuch as will dry the Air in the Chamber: Fumigations if they be not too ſtrong, do well to conſume moiſture; but they muſt be carefully uſed, they muſt be very gentle and moderate, otherwiſe they do hurt by melting and powring forth the cold humors too ſpeedily, which cauſe defluxions: and alſo you muſt conſider the Patients Conſtitution in the uſe of them, for ſome men are preſently brought to the Head-ach by any ſtrong ſcent, having their heads preſently filled with the vapor: A temperate and proper Fum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>gation is made of the pureſt Amber, putting little pieces thereof upon the Coals; it's
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49088:11"/>
no way offenſive, dries well, and ſtrengthens the Brain, eſpecially the Indian Amber, called <hi>Gum. Animi;</hi> or you may preſcribe this following, which is thus compounded.</p>
                     <p>Take Wood Aloes and Benjamin, of each two drams; of Storax, called <hi>Styrax Calamita,</hi> one dram and an half; Frankinſence and Sandarach, of each two ſcruples; Gum-Animi and Cloves, of each half a dram: Make a groſs Pouder of them to be thrown upon the Embers.</p>
                     <p>Southernly winds, and thoſe that cauſe Rain are to be avoided, night-air, and eſpecially Moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine, which much offend the Brain: Very cold and North Winds are to bewared of, eſpecially when they ſuddenly are changed from the South; for ſuch a wind doth ſqueeze a Brain full of moiſt excrements, and ſends them down into the Body, even as a mans hand ſqueezeth a wet ſpunge.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, A ſpecial care is to be had of Diet, for as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith in his Book of <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> Diſeaſes are partly from Diet, and partly from the Air wherein we breath: Therefore let the Diet be of good Juyce, eaſie concoction, neither cold, nor over nouriſhing: Therefore Mutton, Kid, Veal, are to be uſed, and which are better, young Pidgeons, Chickens, Capons, Hens, Partridges, Black-birds, Thruſhes, and all kind of Mountain Fowl, and Yolks of new laid Egs: roaſt Meats are better than boyled. Take heed of hard fleſh, and of hard concoction, as Beef, Pork, Veniſon, Hares, Geeſe, Ducks, and Sea Fowl: as alſo of the Heads, Entrals, and Appurtinances of Beaſts. Eat Fiſh but ſeldom, and make choyce of thoſe which have ſolid Fleſh, coming out of ſwift Rivers, and ſtony places; boyl them in Wine, adding Vinegar, Butter, and Spice, which Sawce is to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with other meat, unleſs the Liver be over hot; of which principally uſe, Nutmeg, Cloves, Cinnamon: never or ſeldom eat cold and moiſt Herbs, as Lettice, Purſlain, Spinage: but in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer time we can allow a moderate uſe of Herbs which are gently cooling and drying, for the ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening of the Body, and fixing the Blood that it may not evaporate, as Endive, Succory, Sorrel, but they muſt be taken boyled, not raw. Roots of Parſly, Carrots, Parſnips, Mints, Hyſop, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-creſſes, are very good. But you muſt avoid all things that eaſily diſturb the Head, and fill it with vapors; and they are of two ſorts: Either they are ſuch as diſcuſs and melt the Humors with their ſharpneſs, as Onions, Garlick, Muſtard, Rocker, Rhadiſhes: or ſuch as fill the Head with groſs vapors, as Milk, and all Milk meats: All manner of Pulſe, as Beans, Peaſe, &amp;c. of which the red Peaſe are the leaſt hurtful, by reaſon of their opening and abſterſive nature; therefore the broth of them is allowed. You muſt avoid all green raw Fruit, which are not laſting eſpecially, and thoſe which are very moiſt: dryed Fruits may be uſed at ſecond or laſt courſes, as Raiſons, Almonds, Pine-nuts, Dates, and the like; but you muſt uſe them ſparingly, for they are for the moſt part hard of concoction. Pears boyled and Sugared, Citron Rinds Candied, Lemmon and Orange Pills Candied, may be eaten at the laſt courſe: but it is much better to take one ſpoonful of digeſtive Pouder after meat, whoſe Aromatical ſweet vapor aſcending with the vapor of what is eaten doth ſtrengthen and dry the Brain: It is made of Coriander Fruit, Annis ſeeds, Cinnamon, Nutmeg, with a double quantity of Sugar of Roſes. Let your Bread be of the beſt Wheat, wel baked and leavened, and made with Salt and Annis ſeeds: in a great diſtemper Bisket is beſt. Let your drink be thin wine of ſmal ſtrength, which wil not fill the Head with many vapors, wel mixed with Water; and alſo it is profitable one hour before meat to mix wine and water that the vapors may be allayed, and to boyl a little Coriander ſeed in the water that it may better ſtrengthen both Stomach and Brain: in ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Diſeaſes uſe Hydromel, or Water and Honey. This is a good Rule in all Diet, To eat mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, and to let the Supper be leſs and lighter than the Dinner. Sobriety, as in all Diſeaſes, ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in Head-Diſeaſes is of great concernment; for the Head by much food is filled with Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors and Vapors: and contrarily, by little and ſlender Diet it is emptied of them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, You muſt uſe moderate Exerciſe, and every day continue it, for too much reſt wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens the Natural heat, and makes it ſo dull that it cannot well concoct, and fills the Body full of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements: On the other ſide, Motion and Exerciſe ſtir up the Natural heat, help Concoction, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Excrements, and cheereth the Spirits, and purifieth them, but you muſt exerciſe before meat, and after meat reſt for an hour or two, or at leaſt move very eaſily.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Uſe a mean in ſleep and waking, for as with moderate ſleep the ſtrength is repaired, ſo with too long the Body is made cold, burdened with excrements, eſpecially the Brain: but too much watching, makes the Body thin, ſpends the Spirits, and feeds upon the ſound parts of the Body. Let not therefore ſleep be too long, but according to cuſtom commonly ſeven hours are allowed, but more or leſs may be taken according as age and cuſtom ſhall require; if you offend in either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream, it is better to offend in too much waking than in too much ſleep. You muſt not ſleep ſtraight after meat, but two hours after at leaſt, having taken a gentle walk. You muſt ſleep with your head high, and upon one ſide; lying on the back is not allowed.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Al the Excrements of the Body are to be evacuated in their ſeaſon, of the Brain eſpecially; therefore every morning hawk from the Pallat, blow the Noſe, comb, and rub the Head with a courſe cloth, or ſpunge, which will fetch the ſuperfluities of the Brain through the ſutures or ſeams of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49088:11"/>
Skull. The Belly muſt be kept open; and if it will not otherwiſe, uſe a Suppoſitory, or a Clyſter, or ſome gentle Lenitive at the Mouth. For the Excrements are not only taken away by ſo doing, but alſo by degrees ſomthing is fetcht from the Brain, or at leaſt ſomthing is reteined and derived thereby from the Head, which was, or would have been ſent thither as to the weakeſt part.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, You muſt have ſpecial care of the Paſſions of the Mind, from which our bodies are many times wonderfully altered and diſturbed; eſpecially of Anger and Sorrow: Sorrow diminiſheth the Natural heat, wounds the Spirits, whence comes ſmal concoction, and many Excrements: Anger makes a great boyling of the Blood, and motion of the Spirits, by which the Humors are diffuſed and diſſolved, and then if there be any Excrements in the Brain, preſently they are ſent to the weak and infirm parts, from whence ariſe many dangerous Diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>The other two Means for Cure, namely, Chyrurgery and Phyſick, may be uſed as followeth:</p>
                     <p>In almoſt all Diſeaſes which come of the Humors, we uſe to make a general Evacuation by Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letting and Purging.</p>
                     <p>Blood-letting is not agreeable with Flegmatick Diſeaſes; but if in other parts of the Body Blood do abound, the Liver be inflamed, and the age of the Patient be flouriſhing, and conſiſtent with it, we may then let blood: for ſo will the aſcention of vapors into the head be hindred, and ſuperfluous Nouriſhment taken away, that Nature afterwards may more eaſily concoct what is raw and wateriſh in the blood; and then purging Medicines may be given more ſafe.</p>
                     <p>But if <hi>Plethora,</hi> or two great repletion do not Conſtrain, it is better before blood-letting to give a purge for Flegm by way of Potion, Bolus, Pills, or Pouder. The Forms whereof are as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
                     <p>Take of Senna half an ounce; Annis ſeeds, and Cloves, of each half a dram; Leaves of Mints and Bettony, of each half a handful; of the tops of Time, half a pugil: Boyl them to a quarter of a pint in Spring Water; ſtrain it, and infuſe in it two ſcruples of the beſt Agarick Trochiſcated; of Cinnamon half a ſcruple; ſtrain it again, and diſſolve in it three drams of <hi>Diaphoenicon,</hi> and one ounce of Syrup of Roſes. Let this be the Potion to be given with ſafe Government. Or;</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Diacatholicon,</hi> and <hi>Diaphoenicon,</hi> of each half an ounce; make it into a Bolus with a little Sugar. You may ad two drams of <hi>Diacarthamum,</hi> and take away as much of the <hi>Diaphoenicon:</hi> or you may make it of equal parts of <hi>Diacarthamum</hi> and <hi>Diaphoenicon,</hi> without the <hi>Diacatholicon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or,</p>
                     <p>Take Pill. Cochie the leſs, two ſcruples; with the Water of Bettony make them into five or ſix Pills gilded; which let him take early in the morning, having eaten but a light ſupper over night.</p>
                     <p>The Pills of Agarick, and of Cochie the greater, are very fit for this purpoſe. For a Pouder.</p>
                     <p>Take Senna, Turbith, Hermodacts, of each a ſcruple; Diagridium half a ſcruple; one Clove: Give this pouder in Broth faſting.</p>
                     <p>After Blood-letting, if it be neceſſary, we come to the preparation and purging of the Humors, which may be done with the following Apozeme, or opening Drink.</p>
                     <p>Take the Roots of Cyprus, Flower-de-luce, Angelica, Zedoary, and of Elicampane, of each one ounce; the Leaves of Bettony, Marjoram, Balm, Penyroyal, Organ, Calaminth, of each a handful; of the tops of Time and Sage, of each half a handful; Annis ſeeds, Seſelis, or broad Cummin, Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel ſeeds, of each three drams; Liquoris ſcraped, and Raiſons ſtoned, of each one ounce; the Leaves of Senna ſprinkled with <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> two ounces; Carthamus ſeeds bruiſed, and freſh Polipody of the Oak, of each one ounce; Agarick trochiſcated, Turbith, Hermodacts, of each three drams; Gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Cloves, of Each one dram; Stoechas, Roſemary, Sage, and Lavender Flowers, of each one Pugil, or ſmal handful: Boyl them in fair Water to two pints; ſtrain it and ad four ounces of white Sugar: clarifie it, and aromatize it, that is, make it ſweet with two drams of Cinnamon; let this be for four morning draughts.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt and laſt draught diſſolve of <hi>Diacarthamum,</hi> or <hi>Diaphoenicon</hi> three drams; and let him drink it with Phyſical Regiment.</p>
                     <p>Or if you ad no Electuary to the laſt doſe the day following. you may give the purging Pills above mentioned.</p>
                     <p>After Purging, that the Brain may be altered and ſtrengthened, and the Medicines purging, not leave any offence, the Patient may take this Bolus following:</p>
                     <p>Take of old Treacle one dram; Conſerve of Roſemary and Roſes, of each two ſcruples: with Sugar make a Bolus, which let him take in the morning two hours before meat, and drink after a ſmal draught of ſmal Wine.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe this is a ſtubborn Diſeaſe, and will not alwaies yield to gentle Medicines, we muſt fly to ſtronger. And then after Purging, we muſt uſe a ſweating Diet, which dries and warms the Brain and the whol Body; concocts crude and raw humors, &amp; makes the thick humors thin, cuts thoſe which are ſlimy and clammy, clenſeth thoſe that are foul and dul, and ſends forth whatſoever is over
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49088:12"/>
moiſt by Urine, Sweat, or inſenſible tranſpiration. For the effect of all which it is very good to uſe a ſlender Diet at the time of taking it.</p>
                     <p>This Diet drink may be made either of a Decoction of Guajacum, or Lignum vitae only, or by putting to it ſome Saſſaphras, or Roots of Sarſaparilla, or thoſe things which are moſt proper for the Head, as the Prudent Phyſitian ſhall think fit that wil conſider the divers tempers and conſtitutions of Bodies; in reſpect of which he will preſcribe a longer or ſhorter continuance of this Diet to fifteen, twenty, or thirty daies.</p>
                     <p>Now the Sweating drink is made as followeth:</p>
                     <p>Take of Chips of Guajacum, and Roots of Sarſaparilla, of each two ounces: infuſe them twenty four hours in four pints of Water upon warm <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>mbers: then boyl them gently without ſmoak to the conſumption of half; ſtrain it through a Hippocras bag, and keep it in a glaſs bottle, and give half a pint warm in the morning, covering him warm, and provoking ſweat.</p>
                     <p>Take of Sarſaparilla two ounces; infuſe them twelve hours in twelve pints of Spring Water; then boyl them as before to the conſumption of the fourth part; ſtrain as before, adding Corian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſeeds, Liquoris, Sugar or Cinnamon, as much as will make it pleaſant. Uſe this for ordinary Table Drink at the time of the Diet; eating Bisket made with Annis ſeeds, roaſt Meat, not boyled, Almonds roaſted, Raiſons, Pinenuts, Prunes boyled with Sugar, and the like.</p>
                     <p>This is alwaies to be obſerved in the uſe of Sudorofick or Sweating Medicines: You muſt give a Purge once a week, and that day omit ſweating, by reaſon that ſweating expels only the thinner matter, leaving the thick which muſt be ſent forth by ſtool. Moreover, becauſe by the uſe of ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Medicines the Body is often bound, you muſt give a Clyſter every third or fourth day.</p>
                     <p>If the Diſeaſe be not yet cured, you may uſe theſe bags for the Head, in the time of ſweat.</p>
                     <p>Take of Annis ſeeds, Fennel ſeeds, Bay-berries poudered, of each three ounces; of <hi>Milium,</hi> or Millet ſeed, or Hyrſe, one pound; of common Salt half a pound: Fry them in a Pan, powring by degrees a little ſtrong Wine upon them. With theſe fill two bags, apply them hot one after another to the mold of the head being ſhaven; do this preſently after he hath taken the ſweating Potion. Then wipe off the ſweat, and clap this ſtrengthening Plaiſter to the Head.</p>
                     <p>Take of cleer Amber, Frankinſence, Maſtick, of each one dram and an half; Galbanum, Opopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nax, of each one ſcruple; of Miſſelto of the Oak two drams; male Peony ſeeds half a dram; Oyl of Nutmegs as much as is ſufficient: Make a Plaiſter of them in an oval form. Or you may uſe the head ſtrengthening Plaiſter in the Apothecaries Shops at <hi>Mountpelior,</hi> not in the <hi>Diſpenſatory,</hi> whoſe deſcription followeth:</p>
                     <p>Take of Storax, Benjamin, Laudanum, of each four ounces; Peony roots, Flower-de-luce roots, Miſſelto of the Oak, Maſtich, of each one ounce; liquid Styrax as much as is ſufficient to make a Plaiſter: of which one ounce upon Leather in an oval form may be applied to the Coronal Suture.</p>
                     <p>If you deſire a more drawing diſſolving Plaiſter which is commonly called <hi>Epiſpaſtick,</hi> thus you muſt make it.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Emplaſter de Mucilaginibus</hi> two ounces; Flower-de-luce roots, Hermodacts, Pellitory of Spain, Staphiſagre, Cubebs, Pidgeons dung, Muſtard ſeed, of each one ounce; Nutmeg, Cloves, Cinnamon, long Pepper, and black Pepper, of each half a ſcruple; Liquid Styrax as much as is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient: Make a Body of Plaiſter, and ſpread a little upon Leather in an oval form for the mold of the head.</p>
                     <p>After General Evacuations, you may come to Particulars; which are made by Errhins or Juyces, for the Noſtrils, ſneezing pouders, Apoplegmatiſms, or Medicines chewed in the Mouth.</p>
                     <p>Take Leaves of Marjoram, Sage, and Bettony, of each one handful; beat them in a Marble ſtone Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, ſprinkling by degrees Bettony Water, and white Wine, of each two ounces: Preſs out the Juyce and make an Errhine, which you may make ſharper if you ad half an ounce of Flower-de-luce roots.</p>
                     <p>It is a cuſtom now adaies to rub the dry Leaves of Tobacco between the fingers, and to ſnuff up the Pouder: this fetcheth much humor from the Brain, and is at hand.</p>
                     <p>But the beſt Sternutatories are made thus:</p>
                     <p>Take the Leaves of Marjoram, Sage, Roſemary, all dried, of each half a dram; Pellitory of Spain and white Hellebore, of each one ſcruple; Musk three grains; which with a Quil may be blown into the Noſtrils. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take Ginger, and Flower-de-luce Roots, or Orrace, of each one ſcruple; Caſtor half a ſcruple; Euphorbium ſix grains: Make them into Pouder. But the chiefeſt ſmelling Pouder is made of black Hellebore, with an equal weight of Sugar Candy finely poudered. Which alſo is excellent for curing a defluxion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Apophlegmatiſmi,</hi> or Medicines drawing Flegm out of the Head, are either called <hi>Maſticatories,</hi> that is, chewing Medicines; or <hi>Gargariſms,</hi> that is, Medicines to gargle in the Throat. A Maſtica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory is th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s prepared.</p>
                     <p>Take of Pellitory of Spain two drams; Muſtard ſeed and Staviſagre, of each one dram: Make
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49088:12"/>
them up with white Wax into little Balls; of which let one be chewed every morning, holding down the head.</p>
                     <p>A Flower-deluce root is uſual for the ſame purpoſe, which wil do good in ſmal infirmities. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtich alone chewed is the mildeſt Maſticatory, and it attracts, and draws humors to the mouth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out heat and inflamation, which others do not.</p>
                     <p>A Gargariſm is thus made:</p>
                     <p>Take of Staviſagre half an ounce; Muſtard ſeed three drams; Pellitory of Spain one dram: Boyl them in Water and Honey to three ounces, in which diſſolve Vinegar of Squils two ounces.</p>
                     <p>In the uſe of theſe Medicines we muſt obſerve, That the Evacuation which is made by the Pallat, is more beneficial than that which is made from other parts, becauſe it is ordained by Nature for the only way by which the Head is to be purged and clenſed. But the Noſe is made for ſmelling and breathing through, and Nature doth oppreſs and abuſe it, when ſhe ſends forth her ſuperfluous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements by it. Moreover the way of Evacuation by the Pallat is more ſafe, neither is the Brain ſo much ſhaked by it as by ſneezing. But Errhines, or Medicines that purge the head by the Noſe, do draw forth the matter more violently, becauſe not only the quality or vapor of the Medicine ſtir up the Brain as in Gargariſms, but alſo the very ſubſtance it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>We muſt alſo obſerve, That the uſe of Errhines or neezings is dangerous when the eyes are ſore, or the Noſtrils are ulcerated or ſore, and when the patient is inclined to bleeding at the Noſe, or to a giddineſs of the Head, which neezings wil ſuddenly bring by ſhaking the Brain too violently.</p>
                     <p>Liquid and moiſt Errhines are ſnuft into the Noſe from the palm of the hand, or by lying down are powred in; but the mouth muſt firſt be filled with Water or Wine, leſt that Medicine come by the Pallat into the mouth, although that which paſſeth through brings the humors more forcibly out of the mouth.</p>
                     <p>They muſt take heed of Gargariſms that are ſubject to Defluxions or Conſumptions.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, For particular Evacuations we may uſe <hi>Veſicatories,</hi> or Plaiſters that draw bliſters, to the Nape of the Neck. In the Diſpenſatory of <hi>Mountpelior</hi> is this Receipt, though it be not in any other.</p>
                     <p>Take of Galbanum and Ammoniacum, of each five ounces; of the Pouder of Cantharides, or Spaniſh Flyes, one pound and an half; Muſtard, Pepper, of each half a pound; Virdegreece and Pellitory of Spain, of each two ounces and an half; Euphorbium one ounce and an half; Wax one pound and an half; Pitch, Rozin, and Turpentine, of each one pound; Oyl a ſmal quantity. One ounce or two of this Plaiſter ſpread upon Leather, may be applied to the Nape of the Neck.</p>
                     <p>The Brain is alſo ſtrengthened by outward application of Pouders. Rhewm-Caps, by which it is comforted and made warm, and the remainder of the Humor diſperſed.</p>
                     <p>Take Pouder of Orrace half a pound; Storax and Benjamin, of each two ounces: pouder the Head with them every night, and comb it off in the morning.</p>
                     <p>This Pouder is very refreſhing by its ſcent, ſtrengtheneth the Head, dryeth the Hair: If you wil make it ſtronger, put Cloves, Nutmegs, and Cinnamon thereto.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of Stoechas, Roſemary Flowers, and red Roſe Leaves, of each half a ſmal handful; dried Bettony two ſcruples; Coriander ſeed,</hi> Lignum Rhodii, <hi>Frankinſence, Orrace, Nutmeg, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtich, of each one ſcruple; Benjamin, Vernix, Mace, and Cloves, of each half a ſcruple<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pouder them, and wrap them in the thrids of Scarlet or ſweet Cotton, and with a piece of red Taffety make a Rhewm-Cap for the Head, to be ſewed in another Cap, or to be worn by it ſelf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The following Fumigation doth dry the Head.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of</hi> Lignum Aloes, <hi>Frankinſence, Maſtick, cleer Amber, yellow Sanders, red Roſe Leaves, Bettony dried, of each one dram; Cinnamon, Mace, Cloves, Styrax Calamita, of each one ſcruple: make them all into groſs Pouder, which you muſt ſprinkle upon coals of fire, and let the Patient take the fume or ſmoak of it faſting, covering his head with a large linnen cloth to preſerve the fume, and opening his mouth: Let him do this twice or thrice in a week.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if by Fumes he find pain in his head, you may only perfume his night-caps every evening: For which uſe this following is eaſily prepared.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of Frankinſence, Maſtich, Styrax Calamita, Benjoin, and Sandarach, of each half an ounce; Mace and Cloves, of each two drams: Make groſs Pouder of them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But becauſe this is a ſtubborn diſeaſe, and uſeth to produce new Flegm after both general and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Evacuations, we ſhal preſcribe thoſe uſual Medicines by which the humor may ſomtimes be drawn away, and the Brain preſerved longer in that ſtate, into which by Phyſick it is reſtored. To this end you may make a Magiſtral Syrup of thoſe Drugs which are in the Apozeme, or opening drink above written, taking three times as much of the purging things as before, which he may uſe twice or thrice in a Month, the quantity of two or three ounces in a Decoction of Bettony and Marjo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram.</p>
                     <p>Or inſtead of Syrups he may uſe to take theſe Pills.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="8" facs="tcp:49088:13"/>Take <hi>of the beſt Aloes half an ounce; Turbith that is Gummy, Hermodacts, and Agarick new made up, of each two drams; Diagridium one dram; Ginger and Cloves, of each half a ſcruple; Saffron and Salgem, of each ſeven grains. Pouder them all, and ſprinkle them with the Water of Marjoram: then dry them in the ſhade, and make them into a Maſs or Body with Oxymel of Squils; of which let him take half a dram or two ſcruples once in a week, two hours before Dinner.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The day after his Syrup or Pills, as alſo twice or thrice in a week, let him take a quantity of this Opiate, or Electuary.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of Conſerve of Acorus Roots, or of Ginger, and Citron Barks candied, of each one ounce; the Conſerve of Sage and Roſemary flowers, of each ſix drams; Nutmeg candied half an ounce; one candied Myrobalan, old Treacle, and confection of Alkermes, of each three drams; of the Pouder Diambra, and Diamoſchi dulcis, of each one dram: with the Syrup of Citron Barks make it up: And let him take every morning two hours before meat, the quantity of a Cheſsnut; drink after it a little wine and water.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This following Balſom doth more ſtrongly corroborate the brain, of which he may take now and then three or four drops in wine or broth.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of the Chymical Oyl of Nutmegs three drams; Oyl of Marjoram, Roſemary, and Amber, of each half a dram; Musk and Amber-greeſe, of each one ſcruple: with a little Oyl of a Mans Skull mix them together. You may make the Oyl of a mans Skull thus: Take the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings or raſpings of a Skull that was never buried, put them in a Retort, or Still ſo called, in as much white Wine as will ſuffice: Let them ſtand in</hi> Balneo Mariae, <hi>that is, a kettle of warm water for ſome time; then diſtill it in Sand till it is dry; and you ſhall find the Oyl ſwimming upon the Water which is drawn off.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Anoint your Noſtrils within with this Balſom every night, and it wil ſtrengthen the Brain won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully.</p>
                     <p>There is another cheaper for to anoint the Noſtrils with: which is,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>the Oyl of Orange Flowers two drams; white Wax one dram; melt them gently, and put thereto Oyl of Amber half a dram; of the Chymical Oyls of Sage and Roſemary, of each fifteen drops; Oyl of Spike five drops; mix them together.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is alſo very good for the drawing away of the matter which breeds continually in the Brain, by an iſſue in the hinder part of the neck.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, The Baths which come out of Brimſtone, Niter, Bitumen, as thoſe called <hi>Bellilucanae,</hi> are very good for the drying and ſtrengthening of the Brain if it be waſhed therewith for ſome daies, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter general evacuations are made. Daily experience teacheth us that moſt grievous Head-Diſeaſes coming of cold Diſtempers are thereby cured. It is profitable alſo to drink thoſe Waters for the ſtrengthening of the ſtomach which alwaies doth ſympathize with the head. Therefore I ſet down this digeſtive Pouder.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of Coriander ſeed prepared one ounce; Annis ſeeds, and ſweet Fennel Seeds, of each three drams; Cinnamon and Nutmeg, of each two drams; Coral, Ivory, and Pearl prepared, of each one ſcruple; Sugar of Roſes as much as all the reſt, or for rich folk twice as much, of which let him take a ſpoonful after every meal, not drinking or eating for three hours after.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of Drouzie Diſeaſes, called, <hi>Coma, Lethargy, Carus,</hi> and <hi>Apoplexy.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THere are four kinds of Preternatural ſleep, namely, <hi>Coma, Apoplexy, Carus,</hi> and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargie.</hi> We wil ſpeak of them together in this Chapter, becauſe they proceed from the ſame Cauſes, and are cured all the ſame way.</p>
                     <p>Theſe four Diſeaſes differ one from another after this manner:</p>
                     <p>In the Diſeaſe called <hi>Coma, Cataphora,</hi> or <hi>Subeth,</hi> according to <hi>Avicen,</hi> is a deep ſleep; but ſuch an one as from which the Patient is raiſed, openeth his eyes, and anſwereth, but preſently he is again in a deep ſleep.</p>
                     <p>In a <hi>Lethargie,</hi> the ſleep is like that of <hi>Coma,</hi> but it is joyned with a Feaver and Frenzy, or Dotage.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Carus</hi> there is no Feaver as in Lethargy, but in <hi>Carus</hi> the ſleep is more deep and profound, ſo that when the ſick party is rowſed up, he ſcarce opens his Eyes, and anſwers not, as in the former, but yet being pinched he is ſenſible, and his breath comes freely.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Apoplexy</hi> the ſleep is moſt deep, and a total privation of ſence and motion, except breathing: and ſo therefore the ſick doth neither open his eyes, anſwer, nor feel when he is hurt; as alſo he breatheth very difficultly.</p>
                     <list>
                        <head>There are many <hi>Cauſes</hi> of theſe Diſeaſes.</head>
                        <item>The firſt and chief cauſe is Flegm and wateriſh humor contained in the brain; of which (when there is but a ſmal quantity, that moiſteneth and cooleth the ſubſtance of the brain, ſtopping up its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ores and paſſages) cometh <hi>Coma.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>But if the ſame quantity of Humor ſo gathered together, become putrified and corrupt, or grow into a tumor or ſwelling, or be diſperſed throughout the brain, it procureth a <hi>Lethargie.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>When it is gathered in a greater quantity without corruption, and that the humor is ſucked up into the ſubſtance of the brain, it cauſeth a <hi>Carus.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>And laſtly, When the humor is in ſo great a quantity that it doth not only fill the brain, but alſo the ventricles thereof, ſtopping and ſtraitening them, and alſo when it doth offend the Original of the Nerves which comes from the brain, and is placed in the baſis or bottom of the Skull, and when it hindereth the paſſage of the Animal Spirit, it begets an <hi>Apoplexy.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Secondly, Sleepy Diſeaſes ſpring alſo from abundance of blood in the brain; for if the ſtore of blood contained, be more raw, wateriſh, and cold, it thickens the Animal Spirits, and makes them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to move; as alſo the abundance of humor charging the brain, hindereth the free paſſage of the Spirits, and according as the humor is more or leſs in quantity, more or leſs in coldneſs, it produceth a greater or a leſſer Diſeaſe: So that both <hi>Coma, Carus,</hi> and <hi>Apoplexy</hi> may be cauſed thereby.</p>
                     <p>But drowſie Diſeaſes, eſpecially the <hi>Apoplexy,</hi> are uſually cauſed by blood out of its Veſſels, ſtopping and compreſſing the Ventricles of the brain, and that falleth out either from a vein broken in the brain, or from an over fulneſs of the Veſſels, or from ſome great bruiſe or contuſion of the head, or from ſome cut or punctured wound, by which the veins of the brain are divided, and ſo ſend forth much blood. And the Fracture only of the Skul, compreſſing of the brain may produce a dulneſs, drowſineſs or ſleeping Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It is without doubt that a Tumor in the brain, burdening it with its weight, may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a ſleepy diſeaſe. This is reported by <hi>Platerus</hi> to be found in a certain Barron, who for a long time was ſortiſh and ſleepy, did nothing rationally, nor deſired meat, neither did eat any thing but what was forced into him; went not to bed but by compulſion, but would ſit al day at the Table leaning on his arm, with his eyes ſhut, neither did he anſwer at any time without much asking and importunity, and then very little to the purpoſe. After his death his Skul was opened, and there was found in his brain, a great Kernel, hard, and of a callous body; the cauſe whereof might be ſome ſtroak upon the head, which he had received long before the beginning of his Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="10" facs="tcp:49088:14"/>Fourthly, Many Vapors flying into the Brain may be the cauſe of a ſleepy diſeaſe: for if the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors be many and groſs, that they burden the animal Spirits, and darken them as with a miſt, even as the clouds in the greater world darken and obſcure the beams of the Sun. But if they be overmoiſt they do ſo wet the Brain that it becomes weak and faint in its functions and performances: Therfore Drunkards ſleep profoundly from the vapor of the Wine, and the abundance of crudities ſent up into the Brain. So Children that are troubled with the worms are often taken with ſleepy diſeaſes from the abundance of groſs and thick vapors which ariſe from crude and wateriſh humors. Soin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting Feavers or Agues, ſometimes in the beginning of the Diſeaſe there is irreſiſtable ſleep, by reaſon of the crude and ſtinking humors which are contained in the veins, eſpecially in the Meſeraick veins, which humors being made thin by the heat of the fit of the Ague, ſend many vapors to the head, and produce ſuch a ſleep as ends with his cold fit ſomtimes, and at other times continues to the end of the fit, according as the vapors are more groſs or thin; or as they are more or leſs in quantity, and ſo are longer and ſooner diſcuſſed and diſperſed.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, Many times ſo great a ſleeping Diſeaſe is begot by the too frequent uſe of Medicines called <hi>Narcoticks,</hi> that do produce ſleep; that many unawares by the unskilful uſe of Opium have ſlept their laſt. There is alſo the ſame ſtupifying force in ſome living Creatures: as in the <hi>Torpedo,</hi> or Cramp-fiſh. So <hi>Plutarch</hi> reports in the death of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> That the ſting of a Viper cauſeth deadly ſleep. But in mans Body this ſtupid ſleeping condition comes from the putrefaction of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, which is ſeen in malignant and peſtilential Feavers; hence it is that in thoſe diſeaſes they are very ſleepy oftentimes, which is a certain ſign of venenoſity and malignity, and ſomtimes of death.</p>
                     <p>The Diagnoſticks or Signs which ſhew the differences of theſe ſleeping Diſeaſes were ſet down in the beginning of this Chapter. But the Signs of the Cauſes that produce theſe Diſeaſes are theſe:</p>
                     <p>When ſleepy Diſeaſes come from watery humors putrifying in the Brain, theſe are the ſigns: A Flegmatick Conſtitution, Old Age, Infancy, a cold and moiſt dwelling and ſeaſon, a ſtopping of an accuſtomed ſpitting and blowing of the Noſe, and when the ſick man before the coming of the diſeaſe was troubled with heavineſs of the Head, dimneſs of ſight, and dulneſs of the whol Body; and when in the Diſeaſe there is a defluxion of Rhewm from the Noſe or Mouth; or when the ſick party feeleth it trickle down his Throat.</p>
                     <p>That ſleeping Diſeaſes are bred of blood, appears by a plethorick or full Body, red Face, pain of the Head going before the Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>A Tumor or ſwelling in the Brain is ſcarce by any ſigns to be known, but is only manifeſt after death by opening of the Skull as was before mentioned.</p>
                     <p>That the Diſeaſe comes from vapors flying into the Brain, appears from thoſe ſigns which ſhew the particular Diſeaſes of thoſe parts, from whence the vapors are ſent up to the Brain. A ſurfet going before, with crude and ſharp belchings, and other ſigns of crude humors in the Stomach, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of the lower Belly, ſhew that the Diſeaſe comes from vapors which are ſent from the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach. But if the Vapors come from Worms, you ſhal know that in the Chapter of them.</p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſis or foreknowledg of things in theſe Diſeaſes, Every ſleeping Diſeaſe is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, but by how much the deeper the ſleep is, and the ſick man harder to be awaked, by ſo much greater is the danger; and there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>oplexy</hi> is worſe than a <hi>Carus,</hi> for if it be violent, it is altogether incurable, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> obſerveth in his 42. Aporiſm of the Second Section; which is thus: It is impoſſible to cure a ſtrong Apoplexy, and not very eaſie to cure a weak one; a ſtrong Apoplexy is when the breathing is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>even and diſorderly, and ſometimes intermitting, and if ſuch a breathing is very violent the diſeaſe is ſtronger, if the breath be ſtopt it is moſt ſtrong; but when there is ſome order in the breathing, the Diſeaſe is weaker, which is declared by <hi>Galen</hi> in his Comment upon the ſaid Aphoriſms.</p>
                     <p>A ſleeping Diſeaſe is very dangerous which comes upon an acute Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>eaſe, for it either ſignifies the extinction of the Natural heat, or a poyſonous malignant quality which hath ſeized on the Brain.</p>
                     <p>That Diſeaſe which comes by conſent of the lower parts, and from vapors which ariſe from them, is leſs dangerous.</p>
                     <p>Men ſick of a Lethargy, die within ſeven daies; if they live longer, they recover. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his Book of Diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>Sleeping Diſeaſes in old men, are for the moſt part deadly; for in regard of their want of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral heat, they having a weak concoction, and weak expulſion, it comes to paſs that they cannot over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and expel that humor which cauſeth the Diſeaſe, much leſs can they expel that humor which aboundeth in the Brain, for ſince the Brain is the coldeſt part of the Body, it muſt needs in old peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have its heat diminiſhed and extinguiſhed ſooner than any other parts.</p>
                     <p>In a Lethargy, if a Tumor happen under the Ears, or if matter or filth come forth of the Ears, and the ſymptomes abate, it is a ſign of health, for it ſheweth the ſtrength Nature hath got over the cauſe of the Diſeaſe, which it expels before perfect concoction out of the Emunctuaries under the Ears,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49088:14"/>
or purgeth it out being turned into matter by the Natural paſſages.</p>
                     <p>They who are preſerved and cured of the Lethargy do uſe after to ſpit matter and blood, <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> in <hi>Coac.</hi> and Third Book of Diſeaſes. This Opinion, ſay ſome, agrees not with Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, for few have ſeen a true <hi>Empyema,</hi> or corrupt matter between the Breaſt and the Lungs, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a Lethargy: But the Interpretation of <hi>Mercurialis</hi> upon the Aphoriſm is very right, for he ſaith, That <hi>Hippocrates</hi> meaneth by <hi>Empyema</hi> and <hi>Empyicus,</hi> not the diſeaſe of the Breaſt, but when filth is diſcharged by the Ears and Noſtrils. And <hi>Galen</hi> hath taught us in his Commentary upon Aphoriſm 8. Sect. 5. and Aphoriſm 44. Sect. 7. That <hi>Hippocrates</hi> by <hi>Empyema</hi> underſtands there, not only that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>It is good ſign when a Phrenſie followeth a ſleepy Diſeaſe coming of a cold cauſe, becauſe by that violent heat which cauſeth a Phrenſie, the watery matter which begets a ſleepy Diſeaſe is conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>

                        </gap>ng from the inflamation of the Humors and Spirits, otherwiſe it will not diſcuſs the matter which cauſeth the Apoplexy: for if it be gentle, and only ſymptomatical, or happening to the Diſeaſe as an accident, as in an Apoplexy, coming from the burning diſpoſition of the head through too much blood contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the veins thereof, then the Feaver doth not diminiſh the Diſeaſe, but rather cauſe ſome ſymptomes of madneſs, which weaken the Animal Faculties: and in this caſe a Frenzy coming up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſleepy Diſeaſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is not good; as we ſaid in the Prognoſtick before mentioned. Moreover, a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that muſt diſſolve a ſleeping Diſeaſe, muſt have another condition, namely, That it come in the beginning of the Diſeaſe, whiles Nature is in ſome ſtrength to put forth ſtrong endeavors. For that Feaver which comes after the Diſeaſe hath long continued is not healthful, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in <hi>Coacis,</hi> ſaith, Apoplexies being like to be di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>A faint Sweat in an Apoplexy is evil, for it ſhews great oppreſſion of Nature.</p>
                     <p>For the Cure of theſe Diſeaſes, as of al other, three neceſſary means are required.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>Firſt, Order of Diet.</item>
                        <item>Secondly, Manual Operations, or Chyrurgery.</item>
                        <item>Thirdly, Medicines, or Phyſick.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>The Diet in the beginning of theſe Diſeaſes muſt be very ſlender; becauſe they are very acute, or violent and ſharp; therefore the Patient muſt be fed only with thin broaths now and then: But in the time of the declination of theſe diſeaſes we may uſe the ſame Diet which is preſcribed in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before going, treating of the cold Diſtemper of the Brain.</p>
                     <p>The other two means are to be uſed by this following Method.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe ſleeping Diſeaſes are ſudden, and ful of danger, they require the Phyſitians chief dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and quick application of Medicines.</p>
                     <p>Firſt therefore, when the Phyſitian is called to one taken with a ſleeping diſeaſe, he ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to raiſe the Patient from his deep ſleep, by offering violence to al his Sences? and laying his eyes towards the Sun-beams, and cleareſt light; he muſt make a great noiſe in his Ears, and he muſt be called aloud by his own Name. He muſt put ſharp things to his Noſtrils, as Rue, Caſtor, Vinegar, and ſharp things into his Mouth alſo.</p>
                     <p>He muſt ſtir up his feeling with pinching, pulling of hair, by ligature or binding, bending of the fingers, and the like.</p>
                     <p>Make firſt a Clyſter of the common Decoction which is moſt ready, after this manner.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of common Decoction for Clyſters, one pint and an half:</hi> Hiera picra, <hi>and</hi> Diaphoenicon, <hi>of each one ounce: Oyl of Rue, and of Lillies, of each one ounce and an half: Honey of Roſes two ounces: Salt one dram: Make a Clyſter, give it preſently.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>While theſe things are doing, the Phyſitian ought ſeriouſly to conſider whether Blood-letting be fit or not; for in theſe Diſeaſes, as <hi>Celſus</hi> ſaid, Blood-letting either kils, or cures; and blood-let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is good, if blood be the principal cauſe, or the aſſiſting cauſe, or if it be <hi>ſine quanon,</hi> that is, a cauſe wirhout which the diſeaſe would not be, if ſtrength permit. But his ſtrength is not to be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked upon as he is in his fit, when his Animal Actions are hindred, but as it was before the Diſeaſe came. For if the Patient was formerly ſtrong, he will endure blood-letting, except the Apoplexy be very ſtrong: and if his ſtrength be not taken away by reſolution of the parts, but by oppreſſion of them, then is blood-letting good. But if Blood offend no way, or if the ſtrength be quite gone, or the Patient very old, you may omit blood-letting, but otherwiſe preſently.</p>
                     <p>The firſt thing to be done either by night or day to one in any of theſe Diſeaſes, is blood-letting, nay, before the Clyſter, if it be not already adminiſtred: But his Arm muſt firſt be well rubbed and chafed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="12" facs="tcp:49088:15"/>And this is to be obſerved, That it is more profitable and ſafe, not to let out ſo much blood at once as you require, but by degrees in ſome hours diſtance; for by the repeating of blood-letting, the matter is more eaſily moved, and the ſtrength more preſerved. Look in the ſick mans face after his firſt loſs of blood, and feel his pulſe; for if his face be better colored, and more lively, and his breath more free, and his pulſe good, there is much hope, and you may let blood the ſecond time with more confidence. Make the Orifice large, otherwiſe he will not bleed, his blood is ſo thick. The more plenty of blood he hath, the more he may loſe: But if flegm abound you muſt bleed ſparingly, leſt the vital heat be loſt, which is ſo abſolute neceſſary for diſcuſſing and diſſolving of this Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>A ſingular Example of large and often bleeding in an Apoplexy, is laid down by <hi>Zacutus Luſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> in his Firſt Book of <hi>the Chief Phyſitians,</hi> and his 33. Hiſtory, in theſe words: <hi>A certain Noble yong Maid, fell firſt into a general forgetfulneſs of all things, and then into a true Apoplexy, with the flowing of her Courſes: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto whom when they had applyed many Medicines both above and beneath, as Ligatures, ſharp Clyſters, Cupping with Scarrification: the Indication which comes from the flowing of the Terms being neglected, and danger coming on through continuance: I perceiving her ſtrength to be ſufficient for it, having firſt rubbed her Thighs very well, and placed Cupping Glaſſes thereon; in the ſpace of eight hours, opened the head Vein four times, and then ſhe began to ſpeak, and ſo recovered.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some of our late Practitioners, are ſo bold as to open the Jugular Veins in Apoplexies, and ſay they cure alſo: and in ſo doing they take this courſe: Firſt they bind the Neck gently with a lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen cloth, after the Vein is opened, they preſently looſe it, and the blood flows well without a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gature, which might attract it to the head: after they heal up the wound with a ſticking Plaiſter, without binding, and ſo they affirm the blood will eaſily ſtop: which <hi>Zacutus Lucitanus</hi> confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth (though he uſeth Ligatures) in his 79. Obſervation in his firſt Book of the Admirable Practice of Phyſick, where he relates a Story of a moſt ſharp Squinancy; in which, by the advice of moſt skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Phyſitians, the Jugular Veins were opened; from whence followed (as he ſaies) a moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous flux of blood not to be ſtopt, which brought the Patient very weak. <hi>Zacutus</hi> being ſent: for, applies <hi>Galens</hi> Plaiſter, which he in his 5. Book of Method, and 4. Chapter, uſeth with good ſucceſs for ſtopping blood in Arteries and Jugulars, and bending the Patients Neck gently, he comes to his ſtrength, and is cured. This Plaiſter is made of Frankinſence, Aloes, the hairs of a Hare mixt with the white of an Eg, having twice as much Frankinſence as Aloes, as <hi>Galen</hi> teacheth in the place mentioned ſomtimes an equal part of each, when the Bodies are harder. And <hi>Galen</hi> commends the operation before written, when he ſaith, This Plaiſter ſtops the flux of the Jugular Veins with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Ligature or binding. But this I would take notice of, That the blood doth not flow forth ſo violently in one that hath an Apoplexy, as in one that hath a Squinzy, becauſe the blood is congea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſhews in his Second Book of Diſeaſes, in the former, from whence the Veins and Arteries called <hi>Caiodites</hi> or Jugulars, are ſtopped: but in the latter the blood is hot and thin, becauſe they who have the Quinzy have alwaies an acute Feaver withal.</p>
                     <p>A few hours after bleeding you muſt purge without reſpect of time. Neither let the Phyſitian be too curious or fearful in purging, ſince the Diſeaſe doth much require it, and the time of the diſeaſe is not uſually long. And that purge ought to be very ſtrong becauſe the humor is ſtubborn, and the Sences ſo drowned that they cannot be rouzed or ſtirred up without ſtrong Medicines. And that Medicine is uſually one ounce of the Electuary <hi>Diacarthamum,</hi> diſſolved in Bettony Water with half a ſcruple of Caſtor. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Turbith four ſcruples: Agarick two drams: Ginger two ſcruples: Fennel ſeeds one ſcruple: Caſtor ſix grains. Infuſe them in a ſufficient quantity of Bettony Water: and in three ounces of it ſtrained, diſſolve the Electuary Diacarthamum three drams: Syrup of Roſes one ounce. Let him drink it.</hi>

                     <p>Take <hi>of Cochie Pills the leſs, one dram; Caſtor three grains: With Bettony Water make ſeven Pills, and if the party cannot ſwallow them, diſſolve th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Take <hi>of Cochie Pills the greater, and Pills of Agarick, of each half a dram: The Troches of Alhandal, Diagridium, and Caſtor, of each three grains: With Honey of Roſemary, make Pills, or diſſolve it in Sage Water.</hi> Or this Potion</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of Senna half an ounce: of white Agarick one dram and an half: of Turbith one dram of Ginger and Galanga half a dram: Boyl them in Sage and Roſemary Water. In two ounces and an half of the ſtrained Liquor put two drams of Diacarthamum the Electuary; and of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor half a ſcruple; of ſimple Oxymel half an ounce.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In a Lethargy, the purging Medicines muſt be milder from the beginning by reaſon of its continual Feaver accompanying; made of Agarick, with Rhubarb or Scammony; or of Pills of Hiera with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>

                        <hi>Trallianus</hi> gives one ſcruple of Scammony with two ſcruples of Caſtor in Oxymel, by which he hath cured many deſperate Lethargies. And <hi>Oribaſius</hi> ſaith, That there is no better Medicine for a Lethargy to purge away that flegm which Choller brought to the Head, than Scammony and Caſtor.</p>
                     <p>It often happens that the Faculties are ſo oppreſſed that Phyſick wil not work, which is an evil ſign, and ſuch ſeldom recover. But becauſe <hi>Celſus</hi> ſaith, when things ſo fall out, we muſt uſe ſuch Medicines as are at hand; if they be proper for the Diſeaſe; which is ſo deſperate that we may uſe deſperate Medicines. For as <hi>Serenus</hi> ſaith, The Phyſitians think ſuch Medicines better in deſperate caſes, than for the Patient without tryal to die an eaſie death. And as <hi>Celſus</hi> ſaith, Many things may be done in time of danger and neceſſity, which may wel be omitted at another time. Therefore when we have uſed thoſe Medicines without any ſucceſs, we may wel riſe higher, namely, To thoſe Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines which are made of Antimony; eſpecially to thoſe which are leſs vehement and furious, as <hi>Aqua Benedicta,</hi> of Dr. <hi>Ruland,</hi> made of the Infuſion of <hi>Crocus Metallorum;</hi> which purging both upwards and downwards, bringeth ſuch a quantity of Flegm, not only from the ſtomach, but the brain alſo, as ſomtimes the Patient is cured only with this Evacuation. And I can witneſs upon my own Experience, That I ſaw a Noble man thrice in two years cured from the Apoplexy with this only Medicine. Although ſome learned men do forbid the uſe of Vomits in theſe Diſeaſes, yet we muſt yield to Experience, which dayly teacheth us, that Children affected with ſleeping Diſeaſes are more readily and ſafely cured by the vomiting Salt of Vitriol, than by any other Medicine.</p>
                     <p>The Tincture of Tobacco drawn with <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> and taken in the quantity of two drams, with Honey powred down the Throat doth excellently.</p>
                     <p>After you have given a purging Medicine, before it begins to work, and alſo while it worketh, you muſt think of al thoſe things which cauſe revulſion of humors, and bring them into practice, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly frictions or rubbings, and ligatures or bindings, mentioned before, but alſo Cupping glaſſes to the back, ſhoulders, arms, and thighs, without ſcarrification if he was formerly blooded, and with ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification if blood-letting was omitted.</p>
                     <p>In an Apoplexy you muſt not apply Cupping glaſſes to the Breaſt or Hypochondria, or parts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Ribs, leſt the Muſcles of the Breaſt and Belly being contracted, the Breath be hindred.</p>
                     <p>The chief and only Remedy in an Apoplexy eſpecially, is to apply Cupping glaſſes to the head: Which kind of Cure the famous Phyſitian <hi>Fracaſtorius</hi> being taken with an Apoplexy, did direct for himſelf by his Nods and ſigns; but for want of their underſtanding of them, he died.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Zaeutus Luſitanus</hi> in his 33. Hiſtory, and the firſt Book of the Principal Phyſitians, reports that he cured a deſperate Apoplexy by ſetting a Cupping glaſs twice upon the hinder part of the Head with deep Scarrification.</p>

                     <p>Let two or three ſharp Clyſters be given every day.</p>
                     <p>Take of Pellitory of the Wall, Hylop, Calamints, Organ, Sage, Rue, and the leſſer Centaury, of each one handful; of Carthamus ſeeds half an ounce; of Fennel and Cummin ſeeds, of each three drams; of white Agarick tied in a linnen clout two drams; of Coloquintida tied with it, one dram and an half. Boyl them to one pint, ſtrain them, and ad to the Liquor of <hi>Hiera Picra</hi> half an ounce; of <hi>Diaphoenicon</hi> one ounce; of Oyl of Rue two ounces: Make a Clyſter.</p>
                     <p>The Chymical Phyſitians do uſually ad two ounces of <hi>Aqua Benedicta</hi> of Dr. <hi>Ruland,</hi> made of the Infuſion of <hi>Crocus Metallorum,</hi> and then it wil work ſtrongly.</p>
                     <p>You may give four or ſix ounces of the ſame infuſion at a time, and alſo you may take it out of the glaſs wherein the Infuſion was made, ſhaking it before, that it may have ſome of the fecies or reſidents of the Pouder in the bottom to make it more ſtrong. Therefore for the moſt part we do preſcribe Clyſters of <hi>Aqua Benedicta,</hi> or <hi>Vino Emetico,</hi> that is, the Infuſion of <hi>Crocus Metallorum,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in many Diſeaſes, eſpecially Chollicks, it doth wonders.</p>
                     <p>Take of Emollient Decoction for Clyſters one pint; of <hi>Diaphoenicon</hi> one ounce; of Infuſion of <hi>Crocus Metallorum</hi> ſhaked together, four ounces, make a Clyſter.</p>
                     <p>If the Clyſter come not away in due time, give this Suppoſitory:</p>
                     <p>Take of the pouder of <hi>Hiera Picra</hi> of <hi>Galens</hi> preſcription, two drams; of Coloquintida and Agarick the beſt, of each half a dram; of Diagridium one ſcruple; Salgem two drams; Honey boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to a ſufficient conſiſtence or thickneſs, as much is ſufficient; make Suppoſitories.</p>
                     <p>It often falls out that the Muſcle of the Arſe called <hi>Sphincter,</hi> is ſo weak, that a Clyſter is given in vain becauſe it cannot be contained, which is a deſperate condition.</p>
                     <p>Apply Caſtor and Vinegar to the Noſe, which are ſaid to have a ſpecial quality againſt ſleep.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo very good to ſprinkle ſharp Vinegar upon a red hot Iron, that the Patient may receive the vapor in his Noſtrils. And it wil be better to put Nigella or Pepper-wort ſeeds, Rue ſeeds, or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoreum to the Vinegar. But Vinegar itſelf warmed and applied to the Noſe, if it be ſharp, ſtirs up the Patient powerfully; and more powerfully if you put to it Pepper and Caſtoreum. The Fume of Brimſtone doth alſo raiſe from ſleep.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="14" facs="tcp:49088:16"/>The Hairs of a Goat burnt, or the horn of a Deer or Goat burnt, held to the Noſe, are moſt ſtrong for the raiſing up of him that is in a deep ſleep.</p>
                     <p>The fume or ſmoak of white Amber, is excellent for the awaking of men in ſleepy Diſeaſes; as alſo the Oyl of it often applied to the Temples and Noſtrils.</p>
                     <p>Rub alſo the ſoals of the Feet with Salt and Vinegar, anoint the hands with Oyl of Rue, and of Caſtorium; touch the tongue and pallat with old Treacle diſſolved in <hi>Aqua Caeleſtis,</hi> or <hi>Apoplecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.</hi> But take heed that your Treacle be not new, for then Opium will cauſe more ſleep. The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine called <hi>Aura Alexandrina,</hi> or <hi>Confectio Anacardina.</hi> You may alſo boyl Muſtard ſeed in Vinegar or ſtrong Wine, and waſh the Pallat therewith. Roots of Pellitory of Spain boyled in Oxymel, that is, Honey and Vinegar do the ſame thing. But with all theſe Medicines you may ſafely uſe Caſtoreum.</p>
                     <p>When you have purged the Body generally in all parts, you muſt then purge the Head either ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly or inſenſibly.</p>
                     <p>Senſibly, by the Noſtrils and Pallat, by Errhines or Neeſings, which are preſcribed in the Cure of a cold Diſtemper of the Brain, and by the touching of the Pallat as before. To all theſe you may ad Rue, Caſtoreum, and Vinegar.</p>
                     <p>Concerning Neeſing, It is to be obſerved, That if the Diſeaſe remain and encreaſe; and if the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient be hard to be raiſed, it is very profitable: but we muſt not uſe them too long, leſt they clog the Brain, and move the humors too much. But in the beginning of the Diſeaſe we muſt abſtain from unſeaſonable neeſing, becauſe it diſperſeth the humor which wil fix in other parts; from whence come ſtubborn Diſeaſes, or a ſmal ſleeping Diſeaſe turns into a ſtrong Apoplexy.</p>
                     <p>Laſt of all you muſt uſe thoſe things which reſolve the humor inſenſibly, which are compounded in this manner:</p>
                     <p>Take Bay-berries and Juniper Berries, of each one ounce and an half: Roots of Angelica, Zedoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Maſter-wort, call'd <hi>Impatoria,</hi> or Pellitory of Spain, of each one ounce: Leaves of Bettony, Sage, Roſemary, of each one handful: Rue, Savory, Marjoram, Lavender flowers, of each half a handful: Boyl them in Vinegar. Dip a Spunge or linnen cloth in this Liquor, and apply it warm to the Head. It is a wonderful thing to ſee what good this doth in ſleeping Diſeaſes: But you muſt rub the Arms and Hands, and the Legs and Feet with the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Take of Caſtor half an ounce: of Mans Hair burnt, three drams: of the Juyce of Rue, of Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar and common Oyl, of each two ounces. Boyl them to an Oyntment, and then anoint the Head therewith, after the Fomentation.</p>
                     <p>Take of Oyl of Pepper-wort called <hi>Oleum Coſtinum,</hi> of the Oyl of Caſtor, and of Euphorbium, of each one ounce: of the Pouder Muſtard ſeed, and Euphorbium, of each one dram: of Vinegar one ſpoonful: of Wax as much as wil ſerve to make an Oyntment.</p>
                     <p>If the Diſeaſe doth not decreaſe after al theſe are uſed, then you muſt apply a great Cupping glaſs to the crown of the Head, and to the hinder part of the Head.</p>
                     <p>But a Veſicatory is beſt if Euphorbium be in it, for that wil draw the humor outwardly which lyeth deep.</p>
                     <p>Some are ſo bold in the height of the Diſeaſe to burn the hinder part of the Head, between the firſt and ſecond Vertebra, or Back-bone with an actual Cautery.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Zacutus Luſitanus</hi> applied many in his time with good ſucceſs, as he witneſſeth in his firſt Book of Wonderful Practice, and the fourteenth Obſervation, in theſe words: <hi>I being called to viſit a ſick man, who was for the ſpace of thirty daies taken with drouzineſs and irreſiſtible ſleep, with a ſmal feaver, not able to hold open his eyes: He had uſed many evacuating, and diverting or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling Medicines, but they perfected nothing; therefore I applied the Cautery with much benefit; for with a red hot Iron I ſcorched the crown of his head till it was hard and cruſty, as alſo the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der part, and almoſt every where about his head, by which means be awaked, and the places bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned beginning to matter, he aroſe and came to himſelf. By this means I remember I cured two ſleepers contrary to expectation, after all other means had been uſed in vain: and theſe were cured by the heat of the fire, melting, diſſolving the humor which came forth at their mouths and noſtrils many daies after.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Others have an Ancient Cuſtom, to hold a red hot Frying-pan ſo neer the Head that it may burn the Hair, and not the Skin.</p>
                     <p>It is good in theſe Diſeaſes to give the Patient a little <hi>Aqua Coeleſtis,</hi> or Apoplectick Water; or other ſtrong Water, which by its piercing quality do very much good, and have freed many from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poplexies preſent and approaching, if Blood be not predominant or chief in the Body, which wil be hurt by the uſe of ſtrong Waters.</p>
                     <p>Now there are many ſorts of Apoplectick Waters, in <hi>Langius, Wickerus, Quercitanus, Crollius,</hi> and others. But we ſhal here only lay down one Water invented by my ſelf, and made of the moſt proper Ingredients.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="15" facs="tcp:49088:16"/>Take of Peony Roots, and Miſleto of the Oak, of each two ounces: Calamus Aromaticus, Galangal, and Cyprus, of each one ounce: Bettony, Sage, Marjoram, of each one handful: Peony, Annis, Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, and Caraway ſeed, of each three drams: Lavender, Stoechas, and Roſemary flowers, of each a pugil: Nutmeg, Mace, Cloves, Cubebs, Grains of Paradice, cardamom, of each half an ounce: Cinnamon two ounces: Saffron, one dram and an half: the Species of <hi>Diambra,</hi> and <hi>Diamoſchu,</hi> of each two drams: Cut and beat them according to art, put them in a glaſs ſtill, and then powr in as much of the beſt Spirit of Wine as is ſufficient. Let it ſtand in <hi>Balneo Mariae,</hi> or a kettle of warm Water with Hay in it for the ſpace of eight daies; afterwards draw it off, and keep the Water in a cloſe ſtopt glaſs bottle.</p>
                     <p>Now if the Diſeaſe decline, and his deep ſleep begin to ceaſe, you muſt omit al other Medicines and follow thoſe things only which ſtrengthen the Brain: which may be very wel done by the uſe of that Opiate or Electuary which I preſcribed in the Treatiſe of the cold diſtemper of the Brain. But if you wil uſe ſtronger than that, take the <hi>Aqua Apoplectica</hi> above mentioned.</p>
                     <p>Continue the uſe of Caſtor above all things, if the Diſeaſe continue, giving every morning three or four grains of it in the Oxymel of Squils, or ſimple Oxymel. <hi>Trallianus</hi> affirmeth that many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome with this Diſeaſe, have been recovered only with this Remedy.</p>
                     <p>Outwardly you may uſe ſome Chymical Balſoms againſt Apoplexies, of which there are divers. We wil only diſcover one of the beſt unto you.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Oyl of Nutmegs by Expreſſion, half an ounce: Ambergreece, Musk, and Civit, of each one ſcruple: the diſtilled Oyls of Spike, Amber, Cinnamon, Roſemary, Cloves, of each half a ſcruple. With this Balſom touch the pallat every morning, and drop ſome into the ears, and ſnuff ſome into the noſtrils. For this purpoſe the diſtilled Oyl of Nutmegs uſed in the ſame manner is much commended.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, We muſt obſerve, That in the Cure of theſe Diſeaſes, we muſt uſe leſs hot things, and loſe more blood, when the Diſeaſe is cauſed of blood; and alſo we muſt mix Medicines that purge Chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler with thoſe that purge Flegm.</p>
                     <p>They which have been troubled with any of theſe Diſeaſes, and are cured, do uſe many times to relapſe and fal into the ſame again; which that you may prevent you muſt correct the cold Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Brain, as before is taught; by which Method you may prevent either Apoplexy, Carus, Lethargy, or Coma. And if the Brain be very cold after general Evacuations, you may often uſe <hi>Aqua Apoplectica;</hi> or theſe Tablets or Lozenges following:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Amber-greece half a ſcruple; the diſtilled Oyl of Annis ſeeds, Cinnamon, and Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megs, of each three drops; Oyl of Cloves one drop; Sugar diſſolved in Orange-flower-water, four ounces. Make theſe into Lozenges, and let him take a dram or two of it every morning.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Pills to ſtrengthen the Head, are thus made:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Cubebs, Maſtich, Nutmeg, Cloves, of each one dram; Amber-greeſe half a dram; of Musk ſix grains. With Juyce of Marjoram make Pills, and let him take one ſcruple at a time twice in a week at his going to bed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Pouder is much in uſe, and is much commended:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>White Amber half an ounce; of the Pouder of the Electuary called</hi> Diarrhodon Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batis, <hi>two drams; of Peony Roots, one dram and an half. Make a Pouder of them, and take a dram at a time in any Water for that purpoſe before every New Moon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is good to hold Nutmeg in the Mouth, and to chew it very often.</p>
                     <p>Sweet Perfumes are to be uſed to the Noſe, eſpecially the Apoplectick Balſom.</p>
                     <p>Uſe Spices with Meat, after Meat a digeſtive Pouder, mentioned in the Cure of the cold Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Head.</p>
                     <p>If you fear a ſleepy Diſeaſe wil come from too much blood, you muſt firſt take ſome away by the Arm, and uſe al means to make the Piles or Hemorrhoid Veins to bleed, which is very good; for which you muſt purge with Senna and Rhubarb, and with cooling things.</p>
                     <p>If you fear an Apoplexy from Melancholly you muſt purge Melancholly, and provoke the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhoids, and give the Medicines preſcribed for the ſtrengthening of the Brain, eſpecially that pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which is made of white Amber, Diarrhodon, and Peony Roots.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of Waking Coma.</head>
                     <p>THE Diſeaſe called <hi>Waking Coma,</hi> or <hi>Coma vigil,</hi> is put among ſleeping Diſeaſes; yet becauſe it is of another Condition different from the reſt, we will treat of it in this Chapter by it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Coma vigil,</hi> is a Diſeaſe in which the Patient lieth with his eyes ſhut as if he were aſleep, when he is awake and diſtracted; and if you touch him, he preſently openeth his eyes, and looks ſtrangely, and falls aſleep again, which is hindered by divers ſtrange imaginations and fancies. This Diſeaſe <hi>Galen</hi> placeth as a mean, between a Frenzy and a Lethargy, and calleth it <hi>Typho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mania.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The uſual Cauſe of this Diſeaſe, is Choller mixed with Flegm, by which humors the Brain is made too moiſt, or it is ſwelled or inflamed; from whence, either the Tumor called <hi>Eriſypelas oedemato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum,</hi> or <hi>oedema Eriſypelatoſum.</hi> But becauſe thoſe humors are diverſly mixed, ſomtimes a greater proportion of the one than of another, it comes to paſs that the Diſeaſes from them are divers: for if Choller be chief, then it is a <hi>Delirium,</hi> or Dotage, and the ſick man ſleepeth but little though his eyes be ſhut; but if Flegm prevail, the Patient doth ſleep more, and is leſs doting, and being raiſed makes leſs noiſe, and is not ſo fooliſh.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Coma vigil</hi> comes by ſympathy from Chollerick vapors mixed with Flegmatick that fly into the Head; which happens in Feavers that come from mixed Humors, eſpecially in half Tertians, which are made of a Tertian and a Quotidian. We may ſafely affirm that this Diſeaſe cometh from Vapors, ſimply hot and moiſt in ſtrong Feavers, becauſe ſleep comes from moiſture, and waking comes from heat.</p>
                     <p>The Diagnoſis, or knowledg of this Diſeaſe, is plain enough by what hath been ſaid, That they which have it, lie with their eyes ſhut, and ſeem to ſleep, yet they cannot ſleep, but toſs and tumble, lift themſelves up ſuddenly, ſtrive to get out of the bed, and then fall again aſleep. The divers Cauſes are eaſily known from what hath been ſaid.</p>
                     <p>This Diſeaſe is accounted dangerous if the Brain have a Swelling or Inflamation, or if it be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome with the humors above mentioned, namely, Choller and Flegm; or if it come of vapors which ariſe from the malignant Humors of a Peſtilent Feaver.</p>
                     <p>If the Dotage, or Delirium be ſtrong, it produceth a Convulſion, for it comes of a Humor or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por which is very ſharp, which falling upon Nervous parts cauſeth a Convulſion.</p>
                     <p>A true <hi>Coma vigil</hi> is cured as a Frenzy and Lethargy; and if it incline moſt to a Frenzy, then the Medicines proper for that are moſt to be uſed; if to a Lethargy, then the Medicines proper for that. But a Coma that cometh by Sympathy, is cured by curing the Malignant Feaver from whence it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth; but the more peculiar Remedies muſt alſo be uſed which draw and keep humors from the Brain in the beginning of the Diſeaſe, as bleeding in the Arm and Foot, Vinegar of Roſes applied to the Forehead, Clyſters, Cupping glaſſes to the Shoulders, Back, Buttocks, Thighs, opening the Head Vein, applying Leeches to the Temples, and behind the Ears, and laying living Creatures to the Head to diſſolve the Humor.</p>

all, <hi>Galen</hi> in his firſt Comment, Prorrhet. Sect. 2. Part 56. mentioneth a ſtory of a School-fellow of his, who when he had wearied himſelf with long Study, fel into a Catalepſis, or Congelation; <hi>He lay</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>like alog all along, not to be bent, ſtiff, and ſtretched out, and ſeemed to behold us with his eyes, but ſpake not a word: and he ſaid that he heard us what we ſaid at that time, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not evidently and plainly, and told us ſome things that he remembred, and ſaid all that ſtood by him were ſeen of him, and could remember and declare ſome of their geſtures at that time but could not then ſpeak or move one part of his body.</hi> But <hi>Fernelius</hi> in his third Book of the Parts of Diſeaſes, Chap. 2. relates two Stories, which are theſe; <hi>One while he being very ſtudious and writing, was ſo ſuddenly ſtruck with this diſeaſe, that ſitting and holding his pen, with his eyes open, and looking upon his Book, you would have thought he had been hard at ſtudy, til he was by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and jogging found to want alſence and motion. Another I ſaw like a dead man, lying along, with neither ſeeing, hearing, nor feeling when he was pinched: but he breathed freely, and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was put into his mouth, he preſently ſwallowed; if he were taken out of his bed he did ſtand alone, but being thruſt he would fall down, and which way ſoever his Arm, Hand, or Leg was ſet, there it ſtood fixed and firm: you would have taken him for a Ghoſt, or ſome rare Statue.</hi>

                        <hi>Schenkius, Marcellus, Donatus, Rondeletius, Jacotius,</hi> and others: From whom you may gather, That in this diſeaſe there is found a deſtruction, or hinderance of the internal and external Sences with a ſtiffneſs of all the Members; and ſomtimes the Sences are not ſo much hindered but the ſick party heareth thoſe that ſpeak unto him; ſomtimes the Members are not ſo ſtiff, but they may be bent and bowed by them that ſtand by, and put into divers Poſtures.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes of this Diſeaſe are divers: <hi>Galen</hi> in his Comments, Aphor. 3. Sect. 2. ſaies that a Catalepſis comes from a cold diſtemper of the Brain, which diſtemper chiefly ſeizeth upon the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der part of the Head, makes it ſtiff and thick, from whence the Nerves proceeding are alſo made ſtiff, and ſuch a diſtemper may ſeize upon al the Nerves, whether it come of an external or an internal cauſe: but ſome queſtion this cauſe, ſuppoſing that no living body can be ſo cold as to have ſuch a Congelation: But <hi>Galen</hi> anſwereth this in his 5. Chap. of his Book of the Difference of Diſeaſes, by a Reaſon taken from Experience, in theſe words; <q>For thoſe who in a journey are taken with cold, which is unto death, are thus ſtiff, whom the Greeks call <hi>Emproſtotonos,</hi> or Bowers forward; <hi>Opiſtotonos,</hi> or Bowers backward; <hi>Tetanos</hi> extended ſtreight: and others that are killed with cold are taken with this Catoche or Congelation.</q> Therefore <hi>Galen</hi> teacheth us, that a Catalepſis may be got by external cold, and Reaſon may eaſily perſwade us to it; for they which are killed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the way with great cold, do firſt grow ſtiff, they have a ſtiffneſs or Congelation before they die, therefore cold may bring a leſs ſtifneſs than that which bringeth Death. So we ſee that Congelation of the Nerves, or Catalepſis, may come of a cold Diſtemper, and the ſooner if it be mixt with a dry diſtemper.</p>
                     <p>But this Diſeaſe is moſt often gotten by a cold and dry diſtemper joyned with matter, that is an Humor or Melancholly Vapor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from which cometh a Conſtipation or Congealing of the hinder part of the Brain, and extention of the Nerves, and alſo a ſtiffneſs of the ſame; from this humor it cometh (I ſay) not only in reſpect of its quality, which is cold and dry; but alſo in reſpect of its quantity, which by repletion makes a diſtention, or ſtretching forth of the Nerves.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aetius</hi> in his ſixt Book, and fourth Chap. ſaith, that a Congelation may be cauſed of blood: Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which thing <hi>Rondeletius</hi> conſents, ſaying, that it comes to paſs when the Veins and Arteries of the Brain are ſo full, that the Body groweth ſtiff, and diſtended or ſtretched out like thoſe bodies that are congealed with cold weather: he confirms his Opinion by a Hiſtory of a Noble woman ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with a continual Feaver, called <hi>Synochus,</hi> who had in the ninteenth day a Congelation, which was cured by a large flux of Blood from her Noſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sennertus</hi> hath found out a new cauſe, which he ſaith is a congealing Spirit, by which the Animal Spirits are fixed, and made immovable: he denies that the force of congealing and fixing depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a cold and dry diſtemper, but riſeth from ſome hidden quality. Such Congealing Spirits are found in the greater World, as in Thunder, when men are thereby made ſtiff, and as it were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed: As <hi>Cardanus</hi> reports of eight Mowers, which ſupping under an Oak, were ſtruck with Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſo as they kept the ſame ſhape of Body, the one ſeeming to eat the other, to lay hold of the pot, another to drink, when they were all dead. It is uſually reported that Wine wil be congealed in the Veſſel by the ſpirit of Thunder: In Earth-quakes, many times ſuch Spirits break forth ſuddenly out of the Earth, as make men and other living Creatures to be ſtiff and ſtark. Moreover, <hi>Sennertus</hi> addeth, that there is great congealing force in Nitre and other Minerals; he brings no Examples: We ſhal only bring one Inſtance taken from Lead, whoſe Vapor doth ſo fix and congeal Mercury, or Quick-ſilver, that it becomes thereby malleable, or to be beaten with the hammer.</p>
                     <p>This Opinion of <hi>Sennertus</hi> were not wholly to be rejected, if he had not made this the only cauſe of the diſeaſe, and caſt off al the reſt; which when they are allowed and confirmed by <hi>Galen,</hi> and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49088:18"/>
the beſt of Authors are not eaſily to be caſt off and denyed. Nor is it needful that we fal to hidden Cauſes when there are enough viſible and manifeſt, able to produce ſuch effects as is before declared. And when <hi>Sennertus</hi> ſaies that this his congealing ſpirit is cauſed of a melancholly humor, he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to differ from the common Opinion, which is, That a Congelation cometh of a cold and dry or Melancholly vapor.</p>
                     <p>The Knowledg of this Diſeaſe, or Diagnoſis, is manifeſt from the Stories of <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Fernelius</hi> already mentioned; for the evil befals a man quickly, and leaves him in that poſture in which it found him; and keeps him unmoved as if he were congealed: The diverſity of Symptoms which we propounded before, is ſeen plainly. We foretel this Diſeaſe by the ſame ſigns as we do other ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Diſeaſes, as the Symptoms are greater or leſs, ſo is the Diſeaſe more or leſs dangerous.</p>
                     <p>The way of Cure is Two-fold either in the time of the fit, or out of the fit: In the fit you may uſe thoſe Medicines which are ſet down for ſleeping Diſeaſes: Out of the fit you muſt labor to cure Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly, the diſeaſe ſo called, if the Congelation come from a Melancholly humor or vapor, which is the moſt common cauſe of it; but if a cold diſtemper either inward or outward give this Diſeaſe a beginning, the Remedies which cure it are to be taken out of the firſt Chapter of this Book. And laſtly, it plenty of blood have begot this Diſeaſe, or doth maintain and nouriſh it, it is very proper to diminiſh it by opening a vein.</p>
                     <p>You muſt adviſe the Patient to a hot and moiſt Diet, as in al Diſeaſes that come from a Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly humor.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of the Palſey, or <hi>Paralyſis.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>A Palſey, is the loſs of Sence and Motion in ſome parts of the Body, by reaſon of the ſtopping of the Paſſages of the Animal Spirits.</p>
                     <p>There are many kinds of Palſeys; for either it is in all the parts of the Body below the Head, and then it is called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>; or elſe it poſſeſſeth only one ſide of the Body, and then it is called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>; or it poſſeſſeth but one part of the Body, and then it is called a <hi>Particular Palſey;</hi> although ſome Authors uſe all theſe terms, as <hi>Paralyſis, Hemiplegia, Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plegia, Pareſis,</hi> and <hi>Reſolutio,</hi> promiſcuouſly for one and the ſame diſeaſe, which is a loſs to Sence and Motion in any part of the Body.</p>
                     <p>There is therefore a double Palſey; one called <hi>Perfect,</hi> in which Sence and Motion is quite gone; another <hi>Imperfect,</hi> in which Sence and Motion are decayed and diminiſhed, and if it be a ſmal dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution, it is not a Palſey, but a Numbneſs or Dulneſs, called <hi>Torpor,</hi> or <hi>Stupor,</hi> which is the way to a true and perfect Palſey, and the forerunner thereof.</p>
                     <p>There is another kind of Palſey, which is, When the Motion is hurt, and the Sence not; or when the Sence is hindered, and the Motion not.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes of a Palſey are generally al thoſe which hinder the paſſage of the Animal Spirits into the Nerves and Muſcles.</p>
                     <p>The chief of al is a wateriſh Humor, which by ſtopping, compreſſing, condenſing or making thick, refrigerating or making cold, hinders the paſſage of the Animal Spirits.</p>
                     <p>This watery Humor comes from the Brain, and fals upon the Nerves and Marrow of the Back: So a light Apoplexy turns into a Palſey, when the Humor that cauſed it falls from the Head upon the Marrow and beginning of the Nerves, and ſo gets into the ſubſtance of them, and ſhuts up thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible Paſſages through which the Spirits come to the Parts; or deſcending by the hollow of the Back-bone, and by the Marrow of the Back and running upon the Nerves, it compreſſeth and ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them, whereby the Animal Spirits are hindered in their Motion.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, The ſame Humor may ſo thicken the ſubſtance of a Nerve by its coldneſs, that it cannot be paſſed through by the Animal Spirits.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly, The Paſſage of the Animal Spirits to the parts of the Body may be ſo hindered by a ſimple diſtemper in cold and moiſtneſs, that the Native temper of a Nerve, and the heat in it may be deſtroyed, and the Animal Spirit not perform his office; for the heat of the Animal Spirits muſt be joyned with the Natural heat of the part, for the performance of its Office.</p>
                     <p>There is a Controverſie whether other Humors may be the cauſe of a Palſey which we will not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit though they are very ſeldom mentioned by others.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Trallianus</hi> in his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> firſt Book, Chap. 6. reports of a certain man that fell into a Palſey through ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and grief, and after taking of <hi>Hiera</hi> he became immovable without motion, and had died if he had not uſed al moiſtening things for his meat and drink, and other things to bring him to a temperate
<pb facs="tcp:49088:18"/>
                        <pb facs="tcp:49088:19"/>
                        <pb n="19" facs="tcp:49088:19"/>
condition, eſpecially many Baths and Oyntments of <hi>Hydroetrum,</hi> that is, of Water and Oyl beaten together.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Paulus</hi> in his Third Book, Chap. 28. and 43. talks of a Palſey which came of a Chollerick Chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, which is cured by cooling means: and in our time the Chollick of the People of <hi>Poicteurs</hi> in <hi>France</hi> is very remarkable, for it turns for the moſt part into a Palſey; and all men of underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding acknowledg it to proceed of a Chollerick matter, of which I ſhall ſpeak more at large in my Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the Chollick. An example is given by <hi>Foreſtus</hi> in his 97. Obſervation, and his tenth Book, of a yong man who had an extenuation for want of nouriſhment in his Limbs; and when he grew worſe by hot and dry Medicines, which Phyſitians preſcribed for him, was at laſt reſtored only by the taking and applying of moiſtening Medicines.</p>
                     <p>And Reaſon doth cleerly ſhew this: for Choller, Melancholly, or any other Humor falling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Nerves; if they fall upon them inwardly, they may ſtop the inſenſible paſſages of the Nerves, or if they fall upon them out wardly, they may ſo preſs upon them that they may bring a Palſey. Nor do the Reaſons which <hi>Rondeletius</hi> gives to the contrary any way convince; when he ſaith, That Choller and Melancholly do rather dry, than ſoften and mollifie the Nerves; and Chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler is more likely to produce a Convulſion by his ſharpneſs and griping, than a Palſey: For although commonly a Palſey be called a Reſolution and ſoftening of the Nerves, which is alwaies in a Palſey that cometh of flegm, yet it is not requiſite that a Reſolution of the Nerves ſhould be in every Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey, becauſe it comes more properly and eſſentially from a ſtopping and hindering of the paſſage of the Animal Spirits; which when it may be cauſed by a compreſſion or ſtraitening of the Nerves, and the like; it doth not alwaies proceed of ſoftening and mollifying. But the opinion of a Palſey co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from a relaxing and ſoftening of the Nerves came from hence; namely. Becauſe the parts which have the Palſey being not able to be ſtretched forth, ſeem as it were to be relaxed and ſoftened; for the motion of parts is by the extenſion or ſtretching forth of the Muſcles, and by the contraction of drawing together of the ſame to their Original; which extenſion when the parts do want, they are ſaid to be relaxed although they have neither been extraordinarily moiſtened nor ſoftened.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, Since there are divers ſorts and degrees of Choller, it is not neceſſary that every ſort ſhould have ſuch acrimony and ſharpneſs as is able to beget a Convulſion.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, There is a various mixture of Humors, and flegm, or water may be mixed with that choller which produceth the Palſey, and ſo contemperate or mitigate his ſharpneſs. Such a mixture doth often happen in Baſtard Tertain Feavers, which are probable to be thoſe which <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> ſaith turn into Palſeys.</p>
                     <p>Finally, This is very manifeſt from the Scorbutick Palſey, or that which is joyned with the Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, which hath often a Convulſion accompanying it (as <hi>Galen</hi> in many places, and <hi>Sennertus</hi> in his Book of the Scurvey, the fifth Chapter) and albeit a true <hi>Scorbut</hi> or Scurvy is ſeldom ſeen in our Country, yet we often ſee certain Scorbutick infirmities, in which ſome ſymptoms of the true Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>but do evidently appear. And therefore in our 74. Obſervation, and the firſt Centaury; and in our 98. Obſervation, and the ſecond Centaury, were given two examples of Scorbutick Palſeys accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with Convulſions.</p>
                     <p>There may be divers other Cauſes of a Palſey which are little obſerved.</p>
                     <p>As firſt, A cold and moiſt Diſtemper ſimple and without matter, may by congealing of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, not only hinder their paſſages and influence upon the parts, but alſo by deſtroying the temper of the Nerves, make them uncapable of receiving the animal Spirits whereby they have Sence and Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and this cold and moiſt diſtemper from overcoldneſs of the air, or from the touching of a cold thing; as <hi>Galen</hi> teacheth 4. <hi>de Loc. Aff.</hi> Chap. 4. of a certain man who (when in a cold ſeaſon, and a great ſtorm, he had wrapt his wet Cloak a long time about his Neck) fel into a Palſey in his hand, the Nerves which come from the Neck and Marrow of the Back-bone, being thereby made too cold and moiſt.</p>
                     <p>Some of our late Writers have reported, That a Palſey may be procured by a ſtupifying or num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing quality, which is inhaerent in ſome Medicines and Poyſons and ſomtimes in the humors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And hence they ſay comes that Palſey which is caught by touching of the Torpedo or Cramp-fiſh: but it is not ſo much to be termed a Palſey which cometh by that way, as a Stupor or Stupifaction and numbneſs: ſuch like as that which Goldſmiths and Gilders have often by the tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and much uſing of Quick-ſilver; and Looking-glaſs makers alſo which is often ſeen in <hi>Venice.</hi> And <hi>Platerus</hi> ſuppoſeth that Wine by narcotick or ſtupifying quality begets Palſeys and Numbneſs: although others differ from his Judgment, yet <hi>Fernelius</hi> ſeems to favor his Opinion, affirming in the place above cited that he once ſaw a man whoſe skin by gluttony and drunkenneſs was all over ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and inſenſible. And <hi>Petrus Fabius</hi> in his Notes upon <hi>Altimar,</hi> Chap. 14. relates a ſtory of a certain Barbar, who after he had been ſtrongly tipling of Wine, awaked at mid-night, and fell ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly into an univerſal Palſey of all the parts of his Body beneath his face, ſo deprived of Sence and Motion that he felt not when he was cut and ſcarrified with a knife, nor when he was pricked deeply
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49088:20"/>
with needles: But his ſurfet and drunkenneſs being paſt, he was cured in the ſpace of three daies, only by revulſions, and reſolving Oyntments applied to the back: Notwithſtanding this Author doth not impute this Palſey to the Narcotick or ſtupifying quality of the Wine; but to thoſe groſs va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors which aroſe from his ſurfet, and ſtopped the Nerves, and this cauſe may be accounted among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theres that produce this Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>We have ſhewed in our Treatiſe of ſleeping Diſeaſes, That there is a ſtupifying quality in corrupt and malignant Humors, which being carried to the Nerves, may hinder their Actions: and ſince the Humors which produce the Scorbut have a venemous and malignant quality, they may alſo have a ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifying for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e which may cauſe alſo a Palſey with the Scorbut, or a Scorbutick Palſey, although (as we ſaid before) an obſtruction or ſtopping or preſſing of the Nerves may be ſufficient to cauſe a Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey alone.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, Tumors growing by the Back-bone, and its Nerves, may without doubt cauſe a Palſey by preſſing upon the Nerves.</p>
                     <p>So the cutting and pricking of a Nerve may produce the ſame effect.</p>
                     <p>The diſlocation, luxation, or making looſe of any of the Back bones, or other Joynts, may cauſe the ſame by preſſing upon the Nerves.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly, The Condenſation or thickning of the Nerves may hinder the influence and paſſage of the Spirits which comes either by too much exſiccation, or drying, or of a groſs Earthy Humor which is taken into the ſubſtance of them.</p>
                     <p>So in thoſe that have the Leproſie called <hi>Elephantiaſis,</hi> the ſence and feeling of many parts is loſt by reaſon of their growing too thick and hard by an Earthy and groſs Nouriſhment which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes of different Palſeys are theſe: In a perfect Palſey, which ſuppoſeth a perfect priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of both Sence and Motion, there is more plenty of the matter, which cauſeth it by a general ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, or ſtopping and binding of the Nerves. But in an imperfect Palſey there is leſs matter to ſtop and bind the Nerves, whereby it comes to paſs that the paſſage of the Animal Spirits is not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſo cloſed up, but it wil ſuffer ſome portion of them to have their recourſe.</p>
                     <p>Somtimes the Motion is hindered, and the Sence not; becauſe there is more vertue to cauſe Motion than to cauſe ſence or feeling, in regard feeling is a kind of paſſion; but Motion conſiſts altogether in action. Somtimes the Sence is hindered, and not the Motion, for in ſome parts of the body thoſe nerves and their branches which ſerve for ſence, do not ſerve for motion: as thoſe nerves which are in the skin, if they only be hurt, the Sence only is hurt, which is ſeen in a particular Palſey, which is in one part only of the Body: But if the chief nerves which are carried to the Muſcles be hurt, the ſence cannot only be hindred, but the motion alſo.</p>
                     <p>The Diagnoſis or Knowledg of this Diſeaſe is directed to three things; namely, The kind or ſort of the Diſeaſe to the part affected, and to the cauſe that produceth it.</p>
                     <p>We may eaſily know what kind of Palſey it is, becauſe the want of motion, and the privation of ſence, are to be diſcovered by the eye.</p>
                     <p>It is harder to know the part affected; but it is found out by the knowledg of Anatomy, which declareth the original and joyning of the nerves.</p>
                     <p>For if the right ſide of the face or left hath the Palſey, and no other part be hurt, the Brain is only hurt in that part from whence the nerves are brought that come to thoſe ſides of the face: But if the parts under the head be hurt, together with the Face, then it is a ſign that the Back bone is hurt as wel as the Brain: And if the parts beneath the Head are hurt, and not the face, the fault is only in the Back bone: If half the Body have the Palſey, only one half of the Back bone is affected; but if the whol body ſuffer, then is the original of the Back bone hurt. When the Palſey is in the Legs, the part affected is about the bottom of the marrow of the Back, and the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> or turning Bones of the <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> and ſo we muſt ſearch out for the place whence the nerves ſpring, which are brought to that part which is troubled with the Palſey.</p>
                     <p>Somtimes alſo the ſearching into the outward Cauſe doth much avail for the knowledg of the part affected: Two examples whereof are brought by <hi>Galen;</hi> one whereof we mentioned before out of his fourth Book, <hi>de loc. affect.</hi> chap. 4. concerning a man in a cold ſtormy time wrapt his wet cloak ſo long about his neck til he fel into a Palſey in his hand. Another is in his firſt Book, <hi>de loc. affect.</hi> chap. 5. of <hi>Pauſinias Syrus,</hi> who loſt the ſence of three fingers; and when <hi>Galen</hi> underſtood that he fel from his Chariot upon his back, he concluded that ſome part was hurt in the original of that nerve which comes from the ſeventh <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> or Spondil; therefore (after he had in vain applied Medicines to the fingers) he uſed means to the back, and ſo wrought a brave Cure.</p>
                     <p>The Diagnoſis, or knowledg of the Cauſes of this Diſeaſe, if fetcht from the primary Cauſes, the Diſeaſes afore going, and the temperament and conſtitution of the ſick party: And therefore when external cold Cauſes and moiſt went before, when the patient is old, when he is flegmatick of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, the weather cold, diet cold and moiſt, and an Apoplexy hath formerly been, it ſignifies that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49088:20"/>
a diſeaſe is approaching from a Cold Diſtemper, and Flegmatick Humor.</p>
                     <p>But when a Palſey is cauſed of a Chollerick Humor, or Melancholly, theſe ſigns declare: Feavers did go before, or are preſent, a Chollerick temper and Conſtitution, or elſe a Melancholly one; the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the diſeaſe in hot weather, Summer or Autumn; the uſe of Spices, Salt, and other hot Meats; heavy and long paſſions of Mind, avoiding of chollerick or melanchollick humors, ſharp and ſowr; many ſharp defluxions falling upon divers parts, and putting them to pain; and laſtly, when pain and a convulſion accompany the diminiſhing of Sence and Motion, and the patient is the worſe when he takes hot and dry things, but the better by the uſe of cold and moiſt.</p>
                     <p>When Tumors, Luxations, or Diſlocations, or Wounds, cauſe a Palſey, they are evident of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>

                        <item>1 A Palſey coming of flegm fixed to the ſubſtance of the nerves, is hardly cured becauſe it wil not be eaſie to diſcuſs or divide the Flegm from the nerves, by reaſon of their coldneſs, and their weakneſs in expulſion or ſending forth of that which offendeth, which muſt co-operate, or work together with the Medicine, and in regard of the deep ſcituation of the Spina and Nerves, ſo as the whol force of the Medicine cannot reach them, and becauſe the Patient muſt of neceſſity continue long in the uſe of Medicines, which for the moſt part people cannot endure, and therefore wil not be cured.</item>
                        <item>2 A Palſey coming after an Apoplexy is ſeldom cured, and often returns into an Apoplexy, by a new flowing of the ſame matter into the Brain, which is made weak by the former diſeaſe.</item>
                        <item>3 A trembling coming upon or after a Palſey is healthful, for it ſignifieth that the paſſages of the nerves are ſomwhat open, by which ſome of the Animal Spirit beginneth to paſs, for to move the Muſcles.</item>
                        <item>4 If the part affected hath an actual heat in it, there is hope of health; but if it be alwaies actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cold, it is difficult to be cured.</item>
                        <item>5 An Atrophy, or want of Nouriſhment in the Paralytick part, with great paleneſs, takes away al hope of cure; for it doth not only ſignifie a decay of the animal Spirit, but a neer extinction of the ſhews natural heat.</item>
                        <item>6 If the Eye on that ſide which the Palſey happeneth be hurt thereby, there is little hope; for it a great want of Spirits in that part.</item>
                        <item>7 A Palſey in the Legs and Feet is eaſier cured than in the upper parts, becauſe thoſe Nerves are harder and ſtronger.</item>
                        <item>8 In old men the Palſey is incurable, by reaſon of their want of natural heat.</item>
                        <item>9 In Winter a Palſey cannot be cured, but in the Spring and Summer it may, if other things agree.</item>
                        <item>10 A ſtrong Feaver coming upon a Palſey is good; for it may conſume the matter which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it.</item>
                        <item>11 A <hi>Diarrhoea,</hi> or looſneſs coming upon a new and weak Palſey is good, for <hi>Rhaſis</hi> ſaith 1. <hi>Cont.</hi> that he hath ſeen many Paralyticks cured by a <hi>Diarrhoea.</hi>

                     <p>The Cure of this Diſeaſe is to be altered according to the variety of the Cauſes: And ſince for the moſt part it cometh of flegm and a cold diſtemper, we muſt labor chiefly to take away that cauſe; which we muſt begin to do by a general clenſing and emptying of the whol Body.</p>
                     <p>As for bleeding it can ſcarce do any good, becauſe the fault is not in the Blood, but Flegm; and this diſeaſe comes for the moſt part to old men, ſuch as are flegmatick and cold by nature. But if plenty of crude blood unconcocted ſeems to produce flegm, and to feed it, we may open a vein in his Arm on the ſound ſide of his Body, but take but little blood leaſt his weak natural heat ſhould be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed.</p>
                     <p>After we have omitted blood-letting, or taken a very little away, we muſt go on to take away the antecedent Cauſe, which is a cold diſtemper of the Brain; which muſt be done as before was ſhewed by Apozemes, or opening drinks, by Pills, ſweating Diet, Bags for the head, Emplaiſters, Errhines for the noſe, neezings, Maſticatories, Gargariſms that draw flegm, Veſicatories or Bliſters, or Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping head pouders, Caps, Fumes, Magiſtral Syrups, ordinary Pills, a ſtrengthening Opiate or Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, by Cauſtick or burning, by digeſtive Pouder and Baths.</p>
                     <p>A Diet Drink in this diſeaſe ought to be made of Guajacum alone, and his Bark; and after he hath taken a draught, he muſt have hot bricks applied to the diſeaſed parts, but firſt they muſt be quenched in a Decoction of this, good for the head made with white Wine and Vinegar, and be wrapped in a linnen cloth, for the ſtirring up of the weak heat which is in the parts; and every fourth or fifth day you muſt purge; but it is better to give a purging drink fif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>een daies before you give the ſweating, that al the load of crude humors may be better caſt out, and afterwards the reliques and remainder may be diſcuſſed by the habit of the Body. Which may be thus made:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the chips of Guajacum, three ounces; of the bark of the ſame, one ounce; of ſpring Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter four pints: Infuſe them twenty four hours: then let them boyl to the conſumption of half, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49088:21"/>
in the concluſion one ounce of Senna: Turbith and Hermodacts, of each two drams. Let him take half a pint of this ſtrained every morning for fifteen daies, not ſweating.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Apply a Cauſtick to the hinder part of the Head, or to the ſound Arm if the other be affected. If the Legs be affected, apply a Cauſtick to them both.</p>
                     <p>After his Diet, let him uſe for his ordinary Drink, a Decoction of Guajacum, or Water and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, wherein hath a little Roſemary been boyled. Let him abſtain from Wine, which is very hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in this Diſeaſe; but if he deſire to drink Wine, let Bettony and Sage be boyled therein. And it is far better if in the Vintage time thoſe Herbs are put into a full Veſſel of new Wine.</p>
                     <p>If the Diſeaſe be perverſe and ſtubborn, omitting the uſual Pills and Magiſtral Syrup; after his Diet, uſe ſtronger Medicines, made thus:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of Pill. Foetida the greateſt, and Pill Cochie the leſs, each half a dram; of Troches of Alhandal four grains: Let him take them once every week.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But becauſe the humor muſt be prepared before every purge, therefore for two or three daies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he takes the Pills, let him take three or four ounces of this following Water every morning two hours before meat.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of the chips of Guajacum, four ounces: of the bark of the ſame, one ounce: of Sarſapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilla one ounce and an half: of China Root one ounce: of Saſſaphras ſix drams: of Lignum A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loes, Galangal, of each one dram and an half: of the Roots of Angelica, Peony, and Fennel, of each three drams and an half: of Peony ſeeds two drams: Infuſe them for twenty four hours in ſix pints of Water, and four pints of white Wine: After ad the Leaves of Bettony, and Ivy, and Sage, of each one handful: of the Flowers of Tile Tree, Primroſes, Stoechas, or French Lavender, and Roſemary, of each two pugils: of Lavender one pugil: of old Treacle half an ounce: of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron ſeeds and bark, of each two drams and an half: of Polipody half an ounce: of Cinnamon ſix drams: Diſtil them in</hi> Balneo Mariae <hi>according to art: and to every two pints and an half of the Liquor, put of</hi> Manus Chriſti <hi>Prepared with the Oyl of Cinnamon, four ounces: Or inſtead of this Water you may uſe the Opiate preſcribed in the Chapter of the cold diſtemper of the Brain for the ſtrengthening of the Head: but you had better uſe the Opiate of</hi> Montagnanus <hi>deſcribed in the Cure of the Epilepſis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When other Purges do little good, it wil not be amiſs to come to the uſe of Chymical Vomits, if the Patient be ſtrong: and they are mentioned in the Chapter of ſleepy Diſeaſes: For they draw the ſtubborn Humors from the Root, and cure Diſeaſes which cannot be rooted out with ordinary Medicines.</p>
                     <p>In the daies wherein he takes no other Medicine, let him take the Cephalick Opiate mentioned in Chap. 1. or the Apoplectick Water, or Tabellets, or Lozenges, for ſleepy Diſeaſes formerly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
                     <p>After Univerſal Medicines we muſt proceed to Topical or particular Medicines, for the part, for the ſtirring up of heat, and recalling the Spirits, and for drying and diſcuſſing in the Spinal Marrow where for the moſt part the Cauſe of the Diſeaſe lyeth.</p>
                     <p>Therefore let the part affected be dayly rubbed with warm cloaths, but gently, leſt that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat and ſpirits drawn thither ſhould be again diſperſed.</p>
                     <p>Alſo let Cupping glaſſes be applied to the heads of the Muſcles of the part affected; and let them be narrow mouthed, and applied very hot; but let them not ſtand on very long leſt they diſperſe too much. After apply a Plaiſter of Pitch, and the Rozin of the Pine tree, that what is drawn thither may be preſerved. Or rub gently the part benummed with green Nettles, or lay on Sinapiſms, or Medicines of Muſtard, while the part begins to grow red; but you muſt not let them lie while they make Bliſters, for ſo the Spirits and Blood would be diſperſed, but only til the part made red will not grow white by the impreſſion of the finger, but remain red ſtill.</p>
                     <p>Afterward anoint the part, and the Spinal Marrow with Oyls, Oyntments, and Balſoms, of which there are many forms in Authors. The Balſom of <hi>Guido</hi> which is prepared by the Apothecaries, is excellent for this purpoſe. This we uſe alone, or mixed with other Medicines.</p>
                     <p>It is made after this manner:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of Oyl of Foxes, Earth-worms, and Caſtor, of each one ounce: of</hi> Guido'<hi>s Balſom, three ounces: of</hi> Aqua vitae <hi>half an ounce: of Oyl of Roſemary diſtilled, one dram and an half: Mix them for a Liniment. With which anoint all the Spinal Marrow very hot, and the parts al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo reſolved covering them with warm cloaths.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This following Oyntment of <hi>Valeriola</hi> in his Obſervations, is much commended.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of Sage Marjoram, Bettony, Bayes, Roſemary, and Primroſe leaves, of each one handful: of the Roots of Time, Acorus, or great Galangal, and Flower deluce newly gathered, of each three ounces: of the Oyl of Foxes, of Indian Nuts, and Rue, of each one pound: of Oyl of Terepin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, half a pound: of the ſtrongeſt Wine one pound: of</hi> Aqua vitae <hi>half a pound: Boyl them till the Wine be conſumed, then ſtrain them, and ad of Serapinum, or Sagapenum, Opopanax, and

                     </p>
                     <p>But an Oyntment of greater effect, and leſs trouble, is made in this manner:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of the Juyce of Squils or Sea Onions, four ounces: the Juyce of Cowcumber and Rue, of each one ounce: Euphorbium, Caſtor, Sagapenum, Ammoniacum, and Bdellium diſſolved in Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, of each one dram and an half: Mirrh, Frankinſence, Pellitory, and Niter, of each one dram: the Oyls of Elder, Turpentine, and Euphorbium, of each half an ounce: Wax as much as is ſufficient: Make an Oyntment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You muſt chiefly uſe the Oyntments in the time of his Diet, after the ſweating is wiped off, and after the time of bathing; for then the pores and paſſages of the Skin being open do more eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Oyntment.</p>
                     <p>Let the Linnen cloaths that are uſed after anointing be warmed with this Fumigation.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of Amber, Maſtich, and Mirrh, of each one dram: Frankinſence two ſcruples: Cloves, Nutmegs, Cinnamon, and Mace, of each half a dram: Wood of Aloes half a ſcruple: Pouder them, and ſprinkle them with the ſpirit of Wine, dry them, and do ſo five times, and then make a pouder to be thrown upon Embers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the Diſeaſe do not yeild to theſe, Cerats and Emplaſters muſt be laid to the Back.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of the Emplaſter of Bettony, Melilot, and Bay-berries, of each one ounce: Frankinſence half an ounce: Caſtor and Euphorbium, of each one dram: the ſeeds of Nigella or Gith, the ſeeds of Water-creſſes and Muſtard, the Roots of Pellitory, and of Sal Niter, of each half an ounce: with the Oyl of Bricks make them into the form of an Emplaſter, which apply upon Leather.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But this following is better.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of Pitch, Galbanum, Sagapenum, and Ammoniacum, of each one ounce: Pellitory, and Muſtard ſeed, of each half an ounce: Euphorbium two drams: yellow Wax three drams: With as much Oyl of Turpentine as is ſufficient make a Plaiſter.</hi>

                     <p>You may alſo provoke ſweat in the part by the fume of the Decoction of Herbs and Roots proper for the Head boyled in white Wine, which you muſt do by putting it into ſuch a Veſſel as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient being faſting, may ſit ſo covered over it, that the Water may not touch him, but the vapor only.

                     <p>When the Patient hath ſweat enough, get him to bed, and give one dram of Treacle with any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Water diſtilled: He muſt bath thus twice or thrice in a week.

                        <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of a Convulſion.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>SPaſmus,</hi> Cramp, or Convulſion, is an involuntary and continued retraction of the Nerves and Muſcles to their Original.</p>
                     <p>Convulſion is two-fold: The one Proper, to which the Definition mentioned agreeth: The other Improper, which is called a Convulſive Motion: and they are thus diſtinguiſhed: In a true Convulſion, the retraction of the Muſcles is alwaies; but in a Convulſive Motion, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction is every time new. Moreover, in a true Convulſion the Limb is immovable, in a Convulſive Motion it is moved divers waies, as in the Falling-ſickneſs, which is the chief of Convulſive Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                     <p>They differ alſo in reſpect of their Cauſes; for a true Convulſion, is either from Fulneſs or Emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs; but a Convulſive Motion is from Irritation or provocation. Laſtly, they are diſtinguiſhed, in that the true Convulſion comes from the Diſeaſe only; the Convulſive Motion from the faculty alone. Which, that Novices may rightly underſtand, they muſt know that <hi>Galen</hi> in his Second Book; <hi>de ſympt. cauſ.</hi> chap. 1. hath thus diſtinguiſhed the ſymptoms of a depraved Motion: Some (ſaith he) are only the work of Nature, which is conſtrained to move ſo from ſome violent cauſe: Others accompany diſeaſes, Nature not aſſiſting their production: Others are by the agreement and concurrence of Nature and the Diſeaſe. Now <hi>Galen</hi> by the name of Nature, underſtands a Faculty: the Operations of the Faculty are, Neeſing, Coughing, Yawning, Reaching, and Hiccoughs: But the operations of the Diſeaſe only, is Palpitation and Convulſion: But the operation of both the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe and Faculty, is Trembling, and imperfect Palſey, or Reſolution.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Galens</hi> words above mentioned, there ariſeth a great difficulty, when he mentions the Hic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coughs in the operations of the Faculty; for it continueth by Irritation, or provocation, and is a Convulſive Motion: But <hi>Galen</hi> recites a Convulſion among thoſe operations which come only from the Diſeaſe. Yet <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his 39. Aphoriſm, and Sect. 6. affirmeth that the Hiccough and Convulſion come of fulneſs and emptineſs, and repletion and inanition, or fulneſs and emptineſs make only a true Convulſion. For the reſolving of which difficulty, we ſay that the word Reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or fulneſs, in its large ſence comprehends Provocation, according to many Authors, becauſe the provoking cauſes are material, and therefore do in ſome ſort fill the parts in which they are contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; but thus Repletion is not the immediate cauſe of Hiccoughs, but the mediate, becauſe it doth provoke the part in which it is to expulſion, by its quantity or quality.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, We muſt know, and obſerve, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> do declare a Convulſive Motion by the general name of a Convulſion; ſo that they cannot be diſtinguiſhed, but by the differences mentioned.</p>
                     <p>Again, A true Convulſion is divided into a total one, by which almoſt the whol body is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; and a partial one, which is only in ſome one Member.</p>
                     <p>An Univerſal or total Convulſion, is cauſed either from the Brain, when the Muſcles of the Face are pluckt together as well as the whol Body: Or from the Spinal Marrow, when the Muſcles that move the Head, and Spina or Back, either before or behind, or both, are pluckt and drawn together. Whence ariſe three kinds of Convulſions. The firſt called <hi>Emproſtotonos,</hi> when the Body with the Neck and Head, is violently contracted and drawn forward, ſo that the Chin is joyned to the Breaſt, and the Body looks like the keel of a Ship; nay, it is ſomtimes like a Bow, and ſomtimes round, and the Head of the Patient is joyned to his Knees, and then the two Muſcles which bend the Head for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward are chiefly affected. The Second is called <hi>Opiſtotonos,</hi> when the Body is drawn backward, and in that, either the twelve Muſcles which extend the head, or ſome of them are drawn together. The third is called <hi>Tetanos,</hi> when the Muſcles both before and behind, are equally contracted, and the parts drawn by the oppoſite Muſcles being ballanced remain ſtiff and ſtraight, and that is called <hi>Motus Tonicus,</hi> which is a moſt violent ſpringing from the contention of al the Muſcles.</p>
                     <p>A Particular Convulſion is made from the contraction of the Muſcle of ſome part coming from the hurt of that Nerve which is ordained for his motion, and ſomtimes it hath a peculiar name from the effect or ſymptome. So the Convulſion of thoſe Muſcles which move the Eyes, is called <hi>Strabiſmus:</hi> of the Jaws and Temples is called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. The Convulſion of the Mouth by Contraction of the broad Muſcle on the one ſide, is called <hi>Spaſmus Cynicus,</hi> a dog Convulſion, and a wreſting of the mouth; but if the contraction be on both ſides, it is called <hi>Riſus Sardonicus,</hi> or a grinning. But the wryneſs of the mouth may be without a Convulſion, namely, from the Reſolution of one Muſcle, which being reſolved, the muſcle on the other ſide draws it to the ſound part, and there is a diſtorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49088:23"/>
or wryneſs which is improperly called a Convulſion: The Convulſion of the muſcles of the Yard is called <hi>Satyriaſis,</hi> or <hi>Priapiſmus.</hi> Other Convulſions want proper names.</p>
                     <p>But the immediate cauſes of a Convulſion according to the Opinion of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> are Repletion and Inanition, or fulneſs and emptineſs as above mentioned. And this Opinion is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Example of a Lute or Harp ſtrings, which uſe to be ſtretched; which Inſtance <hi>Galen</hi> doth bring moſt elegantly in his Book of Palpitation, of trembling and ſhaking, chap. 8. and his third Book of Parts affected, chap. 6. and his ſecond Book of the Cauſes of Symptomes, chap. 2. and his Comment upon Aphor. 39. Sect. 6. For ſaith he, while the ſtrings are moiſt and filled with humor, as it falls out when the wind is Southernly, they are ſtretched, and ſo broken; and when they are over dry, as it happens in Northern weather, they are contracted, and alſo broken. So the Reins of a Bridle drying too neer the fire, are contracted when they were before extended with too much moiſture: the ſame befals the Nerves, which being either too full of moiſture, or too dry, are ſtretched and contracted; and the Muſcles into which they are united, are ſo drawn back to their principal or original, from whence all the Body hath a Convulſion.</p>
                     <p>The Mediate Cauſes of a Convulſion, which make Repletion and Emptineſs, are divers. And firſt the Cauſes of Repletion are recited by <hi>Galen</hi> in his Book of Trembling, chap. laſt, to the increaſe of flegm, and inflamation, a wateriſh Humor flowing to the Nerves, is ſuppoſed to ſtretch them in their breadth, which muſt needs make them ſhorter.</p>
                     <p>But here is a very great difficulty which is propounded by divers Authors, but is reſolved perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and plainly by none: namely, what difference there is between the cauſe of a Palſey, and of a Convulſion, when both come from a water flowing upon the Nerves: why that matter which makes a Palſey (which ſo fills the Nerves that it ſtops all their paſſages or pores, whereby the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are hindred in their motion) doth not alſo ſtretch the Nerves in breadth, and cauſe alſo a Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and why the matter cauſing a Convulſion, filling the Nerves, doth not alſo ſtop the paſſages, and cauſe a Palſey, when contrarily in a Convulſion the feeling remaineth, and the part affected for the moſt part is very much pained? For the reſolving of this doubt, Authors are much divided; and the moſt ingenious of them all, confeſs that is beyond their capacity. Moſt witty <hi>Averroes</hi> conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of this Point, breaks forth in this expreſſion: <hi>I would I knew the reaſon</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>why the Nerves are extended in their breadth, and not in their length.</hi> And preſently after he ſaith: <hi>Know ye that the words of all Phyſitians that write of this Symptome, are more proper to Fidlers and Singers than to Demonſtrators, or ſuch as ſhould make things plain.</hi> And Ingenuous <hi>Argenterius</hi> in his Comment upon the 26. Aphor. Sect. 2. ſpeaks thus: <hi>It is not eaſie to render a reaſon of all things, and eſpecially why Water which is ſaid to be the cauſe of the Palſey, or reſolution of Nerves, and of the Convulſion, ſhould ſomtimes bring one, and ſomtimes another, when it is the ſame mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the ſame parts are affected, namely, the Nerves; why ſhould not the ſame Diſeaſe be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies produced?</hi> Thus <hi>Argenterius.</hi> The great difficulty of this matter hath diſtracted all Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into divers Opinions, ſo that ſome have left the Doctrine of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> among whom are <hi>Averroes, Eraſtus, Platerus, Ceſalpinus, Sennertus,</hi> and others, whoſe divers Opinions, and long Diſputations we cannot attend to repeat, for we deſire to be very ſhort, and lay aſide all Controverſies, only adhaering to thoſe things which are moſt neceſſary for Cure. The Opinion of the ſoundeſt Writers, which are unwilling to diſſent from <hi>Galen,</hi> comes to this: That a Convulſion is cauſed of a thick matter, which extendeth the Nerves in their breadth, and contracteth them in their length: and that a Palſey comes of a thin humor which runs through the ſubſtance of the nerve, and ſofteneth it, but doth not open the pores and paſſages. But this doth not ſatisfie a ſoul that is greedy of Truth: For if a thick humor by filling the Nerve, doth ſtretch it broader, why doth it not alſo fill its pores and ſtop the inſenſible paſſages, and hinder the coming in of the Animal Spirit? and ſo bring a Palſey? and why doth not a Convulſion follow a Palſey in proceſs of time, when a thin humor long ſticking upon a part, muſt needs grow thick, even as the ſerous matter which makes the <hi>Arthritis,</hi> or Joynt-gout by long continuance upon the part, cauſeth the matter which makes the ſtone. Others ſay that in a Convulſion, only the external part of the Nerve which is Membranous and tender, is poſſeſſed with the humor; but in a Palſey, the Internal: but this giveth leſs ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: For when the Nerves are for the moſt part ſlender, it is not eaſie to conceive how the humor ſhould only poſſeſs the external part, and not the internal; or the internal, and not the external: Or leaſtwiſe (if this could be ſo) a Convulſion would follow a Palſey, and a Palſey a Convulſion, by the increaſe of the matter; and that which at firſt did only poſſeſs the outward or the inward part, in proceſs of time would ſeize upon the whol Nerve.</p>
                     <p>Therefore we, although we cannot ſatisfie ourſelves in this great Difficulty while better Arguments are propounded, ſuppoſe that thoſe Objections may be taken off thus: A Convulſion and a Palſey differ in this; A Palſey is made of a pure watery humor without mixture, which doth not extend the parts, but ſofteneth them, as we may ſee in the tumor called <hi>oedema;</hi> but a Convulſion is cauſed of the ſame humor, but not pure and ſimple, but mixed with much wind, by which wind the

Nerves are ſtretched, and the Muſcles alſo which are contracted to their Original: For no cauſe can be thought upon more fit to make ſo great a contraction, than wind, which <hi>Galen</hi> acknowledgeth in his ſecond Book, <hi>de ſympt. cauſ.</hi> chap. 2. and Experience teacheth us, that the greateſt diſtentions are made eſpecially by wind, as we may ſee in the dropſie called <hi>Tympanites,</hi> and the Chollick.

                        </gap>ions, thoſe are the greateſt which are cauſed of wind, which ſtretcheth and diſtendeth the parts. By this Argument, all the aforeſaid Objections are anſwered: For if it be demanded, Why that flegm or water which maketh a Convulſion doth not bring a Palſey by hindering the paſſage of the Spirits? we may anſwer, That it is in ſo ſmal a quantity, that it cannot ſtop the inſenſible paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of the Nerves, and that it is ſo extenuated and made thin by much wind, that it cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a ſtoppage or obſtruction. Or we may ſay that wind is the chief cauſe of Convulſions, which <hi>Galen</hi> acknowledgeth in the place mentioned: And in his 6. Book, <hi>de loc. affect. cap. ult.</hi> he makes the only cauſe of a Priapiſm (which is the Convulſion of the Yard) to be wind.</p>
                     <p>The other Cauſe of a Convulſion coming from Repletion, which <hi>Galen</hi> mentions in the place ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </gap>ed, is the Inflamation of the Nervous parts, eſpecially in the Original of the Nerves, or neer to its original, by which they are ſtretched; and that Inflamation is either from a cauſe only internal, namely, from a flux of blood upon the part; or of an outward cauſe, as of a wound, contuſion, or bruiſe, or a puncture of a Nerve.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes of a Convulſion by Emptineſs or Inanition, are all extraordinary or immoderate Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations, by bleeding at the Noſe, or any outward part, by vomit, flux of the belly, or ſweat, as alſo all great conſumptions of the Radical moiſture which happen in ſtrong Feavers, immoderate exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, watchings, cares, immoderate Lechery, hunger and thirſt, and the dayly uſe of Food and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines which heat and dry.</p>
                     <p>This kind of Convulſion from Emptineſs is rejected by many; who ſuppoſe that ſo great a drought cannot be brought into a living Body, as may contract the Nerves; but that is uſual in a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick Feaver, or a Maraſmus: theſe men are thus anſwered: Every emptineſs or drineſs cannot make a Convulſion, but that which is made ſuddenly and unequally; by which means there is a ſudden Evacuation or emptying of the Radical moiſture, which makes the parts cling and cloſe together for the avoiding of a <hi>Vacuum</hi> or emptineſs which Nature abhorreth: but if the moiſture be equally drawn from al parts, and by degrees, there is no contraction becauſe the parts made empty are filled with Air.</p>
                     <p>A Convulſive Motion, is of a ſharp pricking matter which provokes the Nerves; and it is for the moſt part, a humor or vapor ful of acrimony or malignancy, this comes often in malignant Feavers: Theſe Convulſive Motions are cauſed for the moſt part from the Brain and Nerves, ſuffering by ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy or conſent, and then it is called <hi>Convulſio Sympathica:</hi> And this Sympathy is either by their plain ſuffering together in reſpect of their likeneſs in ſubſtance and office, and their vicinity or neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; or from an evil quality, or poyſonous air ſent to the original of the Nerves. And it is often cauſed by conſent from the mouth of the ſtomach through an aeruginous or ruſt like Choller, through worms, poyſon, or other ſharp matter which gripeth: and alſo from conſent with the womb, as it happeneth in Hyſterical paſſions, or the Mother.</p>
                     <p>The Diagnoſis or knowledg of a Convulsion is eaſily learned from thoſe things which we propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the beginning of this Chapter: For in a true Convulsion, the part is contracted, ſtiff, and immovable, that it cannot be bent at the pleaſure of the Patient; but in a Convulsive Motion the part is ſhaken and toſſed hither and thither.</p>
                     <p>As to the Prognoſtick; A Convulsion which is in many parts, eſpecially thoſe neer the Brain, is dangerous; as alſo that which is in the Muſcles of the Breaſt, which giveth us to fear a ſuffocation, by reaſon of the ſhortneſs of the Patients breathing.</p>
                     <p>A Convulsion coming of too much bleeding or purging, is deadly, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith in his Aphoriſms: for as <hi>Galen</hi> ſheweth in his Comment, that a Convulsion comes of emptineſs; but it may ſo fall out as it may come of irritation or provoking by the motion of ſharp and chollerick hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors to the Nervous parts, or of the malign quality of a venemous Medicine, as it happens after the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Hellebore.</p>
                     <p>A Convulsion from a Frenzy is deadly. <hi>Aetius</hi> affirmeth, that he never heard of, or ſaw any ſo taken, that recovered.</p>
                     <p>It is better that a Feaver follow a Convulsion, than a Convulsion a Feaver, Aphor. 37. Sect. 2. for a Feaver coming upon a Convulsion, takes away its cauſe: but a Convulsion coming upon a Feaver, ſhews a malignant matter which threatneth death.</p>
                     <p>Whoſoever are taken with the <hi>Tetanus,</hi> or Cramp ſo called, die within four daies; but if they continue longer, they are cured, Aph. 6. Sect. 5. for the great ſtretching of all the Muſcles hinders breathing, ſo that they are ſuffocated. And we muſt obſerve, that a Convulsion is not the cauſe of death in reſpect of what is done to the Nerves: for a Palſey coming of the like cauſe continues many yeers: but in reſpect of the ſuffocation it brings by the Convulsion of the Muſcles ordained for brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>

                        <pb n="27" facs="tcp:49088:24"/>The Cure of this Diſeaſe is divers, as the Cauſe is divers.</p>
                     <p>That which comes of Emptineſs is ſeldom and incurable, therefore we ſhall not inſiſt upon the Cure of it. Authors do preſcribe al kind of moiſtening Medicines, and opening Oyntments. That which comes of provoking or irritation, is from other Diſeaſes, and is comprehended under the Cure of them. It remains therefore that we treat of the Cure of a Convulſion by Repletion, which when it comes of flegm and wind, muſt be cured by removing of them. This is done firſt by blood-letting if it abound, and the party be ſtrong; but it is better to take too little than too much; for blood is an Enemy to that principal Cauſe, which is flegm.</p>
                     <p>After Blood-letting, or it being omitted if need do not require, you muſt purge with pills which are ſtrong (but have an eye to the Patients ſtrength) according to thoſe forms in the firſt Chapter, you muſt ad to them three grains of Caſtor.</p>
                     <p>If the Patient will not take pills, he may take Potions, Pouders, and other Medicines preſcribed in the firſt Chapter.</p>
                     <p>After Purging, if you have not let blood before, apply Cupping glaſſes with Scarrification; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe without: firſt to the remote parts, then to the parts neer the part affected. But if the Thighs, or Legs have a Convulſion, apply them to the Buttocks and Loyns: if the Arms, to the Neck and Shoulders; laboring alwaies to bring the humor back to its original.</p>
                     <p>You may alſo with profit apply a Vencatory to the parts oppoſite to that which is affected.</p>
                     <p>After the firſt purging, the matter is to be prepared with an Apozeme, preſcribed in the Cure of the cold diſtemper. Make it purging, if ſtrength and other things wil permit; otherwiſe leave out the Purgatives.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of the Epilepſie, or Falling-ſickneſs.</head>
                     <p>THe <hi>Epilepſie,</hi> is a Convulſion of the whol Body, not continually, but by fits, with a hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance both of the Mind and Sences.</p>
                     <p>The Word Convulſion, is not here taken properly and ſtrictly for a true Convulſion; but improperly, for a Convulſive Motion: For an Epilepſy is a Convulſive Motion, not a true Convulſion. But we keep the name of Convulſion in imitation of <hi>Galen,</hi> who calls an Epilepſy alwaies a Convulſion.</p>
                     <p>This Definition is taken out of <hi>Galen, 3. de loc. aff. cap.</hi> 7. and <hi>lib. de diff. ſympt. cap.</hi> 3. and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines a perfect Epilepſie, in which all the Body is contracted, and all the Sences both internal and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal are aboliſhed. Yet there are imperfect Epilepſies, in which only the Head, or Arm, Leg, and Thigh, or half the Body is only contracted. There is alſo an Epilepſy in which the mind remains ſound, and the external ſences, and alſo the voluntary motion of ſome parts. I ſaw a Nun, which in her Epileptick fits had divers contractions, ſomtimes of the Arms, then of the Legs, ſomtimes of the Head, afterwards of the whol Body; yet ſhe ſaw thoſe that ſtood by and ſpake; nay, ſhe alſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored a voluntary motion againſt the Convulſive, ſo as ſhe did in a manner diminiſh the involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary motion: ſomtimes ſhe was in a ſmal fit only, and walked about her Chamber, but with a diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly motion, leaping and uſing ſtrange antick poſtures, by which ſhe cauſed the reſt of the Nuns to be very merry, and ſhe at that time laughed with them, and ſpake when ſhe pleaſed.</p>
                     <p>Every convulſive motion (as I ſaid in the former chapter) cometh of provocation, which procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from the quantity or quality of the matter. The quantity of matter which cauſeth the diſeaſe, burdening Nature, ſtirs her up to expel that which is troubleſom to her. Whence the Opinion of <hi>Galen</hi> is confirmed, which is ſo diſputed by late Phyſitians, That an Epilepſy comes of an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obſtruction of the Ventricles of the Brain; for if the humor obſtructing or ſtopping is burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom to Nature, the Brain will labor to expel it. In the quality there is no difference, for all agree in this, That the expulſive faculty is ſtirred up by ſharpneſs and acrimony, and by any quality which is offenſive to Nature.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes ſtirring up or provoking, are either contained in the Brain, and make a proper Epilep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, or come from other parts, and ſo make an Epilepſy by conſent or ſympathy.</p>
                     <p>And that provoking or irritation makes an Epilepſy, when the Brain laboring to expel that which is offenſive ſhakes its ſelf, and by conſequence all the Nerves which are adjoyned to it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="29" facs="tcp:49088:25"/>There is in <hi>Galen,</hi> and almoſt all Authors, a threefold Epilepſy. The firſt is that which hurts the Brain, in which the Diſeaſe is: The ſecond is that which hurts the Brain by conſent from the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach: The third is when the diſeaſe is ſent from other parts of the Body to the head: And theſe have their proper names; The firſt, as being chief, is called <hi>Epilepſia;</hi> the ſecond <hi>Analepſia;</hi> the third, <hi>Catalepſia:</hi> But (by <hi>Galens</hi> leave) that diviſion is ſuperfluous, and in vain is that Epilepſy which comes from the Stomach ſeparated from thoſe which comes by ſympathy from other parts; when all ought to be called <hi>Sympathicae,</hi> or Epilepſies by conſent. Neither is it ſufficient to ſay that an Epilepſy from the Stomach is diſtinct from others, becauſe it is moſt frequent ſince that which comes from the Stomach and Spleen, is as uſual and as frequent, if not more.</p>
                     <p>Therefore we divide an Epilepſy into a Proper one, and one by Conſent. Again, we ſubdivide that which is by conſent according to the divers parts from whence theſe ſharp and malignant vapors are ſent to the Brain, for there is almoſt no part in the Body from which a malignant vapor cannot be ſent. Two Stories are related by <hi>Galen</hi> in the place quoted; the one of a Boy of thirteen yeers old, who at the firſt had the Epilepſy in his Leg, after that it aſcended into his Thigh and Bowels, and by the ſides into the neck til it came to the head, which at firſt touch made him not able to ſtand Another is of a Youth who in the beginning of his fit perceived as it were a cold air to aſcend. But it is remarkable and well known, that an Epilepſy comes for the moſt part from the Guts, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that breeds worms, from the Matrix and other parts, and it is confirmed by many Authors.</p>
                     <p>Therefore it is manifeſt from what hath been ſaid, how <hi>Galens</hi> Opinion may be defended, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, That a proper Epilepſy comes of an imperfect obſtruction of the ventricle of the Brain; which we cannot defend to be the conſtant cauſe, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſeems to grant who laies down no other: but we are rather forced to confeſs, that it is leſs uſual than the reſt.</p>
                     <p>Nor do the Arguments brought againſt <hi>Galen</hi> any way convince, the chief whereof are theſe:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, As <hi>Fernelius</hi> ſaith, if an Epilepſy comes from plenty of Humors, it would come moſt in the ſleep, at which time there is plenty of Humor. I anſwer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That the humor of which ſleep is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got, is in the ſubſtance, not the Ventricles of the Brain, and therefore doth not ſtir up the expulſive faculty which reſideth moſt in the Ventricles.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Fernelius</hi> ſaith, That becauſe an Epilepſy is quickly diſſolved, it ſhould turn into a Palſey, as an Apoplexy doth when the humor is caſt into the nerves. I anſwer, That in an Apoplexy, by reaſon of the weakneſs of the expulſive faculty which is oppreſſed by many humors, they are caſt into the parts adjoyning; but expulsion being ſtronger, and more free in an Epilepſy, they are ſent to thoſe parts which are ordained by Nature for their diſcharge. And it is falſe which <hi>Fernelius</hi> ſaith, That an Epilepſy never ends in a Palſey; for we have ſeen a Palſey come after it. And ſomtimes Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexies at their firſt coming are turned into Convulsions before there be a perfect obſtruction of the Ventricles of the Brain; and alſo many Epileptick men die by an Apoplexy when a little obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on turns into a total ſtopping.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Againſt <hi>Galen</hi> ſome argue thus: As a compleat Obſtruction of the Ventricles totally takes away the functions of the Brain in an Apoplexy: So an incompleat Obſtruction would only diminiſh, not deprave the Functions, nor produce ſuch convulsive motions as are ſomtimes more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than ſound motions. I anſwer, That Nature being wholly oppreſſed by a total obſtruction doth not labor for expulsion; but ſhe hath ſtrength enough in a half obſtruction to move and ſtir up the Brain to expulsion. This is confirmed by the Example of a defluxion falling upon the Lungs, which if it fill the whol Lungs, it makes great difficulty of breathing without a Cough, as cometh to pas in an Aſtma, or ſhortneſs of breathing: But if a ſmal quantity only of humor do fall, the Lungs are ſtirred up to expulsion, whence cometh a Cough.</p>
                     <p>The Signs of an Epilepſy are of three ſorts: Either they are ſuch as ſignifie an approaching Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepſy, or one that is preſent, or ſuch as ſhew the difference of Epilepſyes.</p>
                     <p>The Signs of an Epilepſy approaching, are two-fold: Either they ſignifie the firſt coming of the Diſeaſe; or ſome Fit to be at hand. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he ſame ſigns ſerve for both, but moſt ſurely in thoſe who are actually poſſeſſed therewith, do they ſhew the condition of it in its return; for in thoſe who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had this diſeaſe formerly, theſe ſigns are doubtful for the moſt part, and may declare many head diſeaſes; but all of them together may give ſome certainty.</p>
                     <p>Therefore al ſigns of an eminent Epilepſy are to be propounded with this admonition, That al ſigns do not meet in al; but ſome in one, ſome in another, as the cauſes and conſtitutions do differ. But that they may orderly be laid down, we muſt ſearch the originals of theſe ſigns, which flow from Animal, Vital, and Natural actions, from excrements, qualities changed, and proper accidents.</p>
                     <p>In reſpect of the Animal Functions, and unaccuſtomed diſturbance of the mind and Body, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth an Epilepſy, heavineſs of head, head-ach, vertigo or giddineſs, or much ſleep, from whence the Body hath no refreſhment; troubleſom dreams, dulneſs of mind, or perplexity, forgetfulneſs, ſorrow, fear, dread, ſloth, graveneſs of actions, ſnatching and trembling of the parts, dulneſs of the ſences, a down look, clouds and other things flying before the eyes, noiſe in the ears, a ſtink in the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49088:26"/>
a ſtiff tongue, and its inordinate Motion, yawning, and neezing.</p>
                     <p>In reſpect of the Vital Function, theſe with others are the ſigns: Anger, Beating or palpitation of the heart, ſtraitneſs of Breaſt, and alteration in Breathing.</p>
                     <p>In reſpect of Natural Functions, theſe are forerunners of an Epilepſy; diſdain of meat, or immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Appetite, Squeamiſhneſs, heart-burning.</p>
                     <p>In reſpect of Excrements, theſe are ſigns: Much ſpittle, thin and crude Urine, often Nocturnal Pollutions.</p>
                     <p>In regard of qualities and proper accidents changed; Paleneſs of Face, and ſwelling of the heart.</p>
                     <p>A preſent Epilepſy is eaſily known, if it be perfect; but it hath many differences which cauſe difficulty, as we ſhall ſhew.</p>
                     <p>In a compleat fit all the Sences both internal and external are hindred. The party ſuddenly falls, and the whol Body, or at leaſt ſome parts are diverſly moved: Moreover, there is a ſtaring and thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting forth of the eyes, gnaſhing of Teeth, a difficult breathing, as in thoſe that are hanged; the ſeed, dung, and urine are ſent forth involuntarily, and about the end of the fit, he foameth at the Mouth and Noſe, which happen only in a vehement Epilepſy, and the fit being ended, he forgets all things he then acted.</p>
                     <p>Some of the Ancients make three kinds of Epilepſies: One which is like a deep ſleep; another which doth ſhake the body after divers motions; a third which is made of both the former. The late Phyſitians deny the firſt kind, ſaying, That it is more like a Coma, or a Carus than an Epilepſy; and theſe two Diſeaſes cannot be otherwiſe diſtinguiſhed, but that in a Coma is a deep ſleep without a Convulſion, and a Convulſion is a certain ſign of an Epilepſie. But <hi>Avicen</hi> ſaith otherwiſe, namely, That an Epilepſy comes many times without an apparant Convulſion. And experience teacheth us, That many men in Epilepſies have fits like Coma: and it's known to be an Epilepſie, not a Coma, or a Carus by this; The ſleep in an Epilepſie cometh and goeth by fits, when in a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma it comes all at once.</p>
                     <p>A true Epilepſy is diſtinguiſhed from an Epilepſy by conſent thus: In the true there appears many ſigns of the Brain affected; as heavineſs of mind, and ſlowneſs, decay of memory, troubleſom ſleep with dreams, dulneſs of ſences, ſlowneſs and idleneſs of Body, pain of the head, and other things. Moreover, the ſick man doth not perceive the fit coming, but is ſuddenly taken therewith unawares, at the new Moon for the moſt part. The due proportion of the inferior parts being without blemiſh do confirm this ſign.</p>
                     <p>But we may know whether it come from the right or left ſide of the head moſt: By this, either the ſight of one eye is more obſcured, or the hearing more thick with the noiſe of the head on that ſide; or if the right or left ſide be more dull.</p>
                     <p>But we may know from what humor, eſpecially an Epilepſy cometh by thoſe ſigns which declare when flegm, choller, or melancholly abound.</p>
                     <p>An Epilepſy by conſent, is thus known: There appear no ſigns of a diſtempered Brain; the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient perceives his Diſeaſe Coming, and a wind riſing from the parts below: or ſome lower part is weakened, or elſe affected ſtrongly in the time of the fit.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things following do ſhew that the Cauſe of an Epilepſy is in the ſtomach: Diſdain of meat, an inability to faſt, loathing, vomiting, pain of the ſtomach, gnawing, pricking, and diſtention; ſomtimes beating of the heart, which ariſeth from the Stomach.</p>
                     <p>That the diſeaſe comes from the Liver or Spleen, appears by often belching and breaking of wind, a ſwelling of the belly with rumbling and noiſe, ſowr belchings, ſtraitneſs of the Midrif, and pain ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times reaching to the back, beſides ſome diſtemper in inferior parts.</p>
                     <p>An Hyſterick fit, or the Mother, mixt with Convulſions, if a retaining of the Courſes or Seed went before, ſhews that it comes from the Womb.</p>
                     <p>If the Epilepſy comes from an external part, ſome wind is perceived to riſe from that part, and the matter cauſing the Diſeaſe, ſomtimes tickleth and beateth in the part, which is a ſign there is a fit at hand; and if that part be tied hard, the fit is hindred.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, The Signs of worms, ſhew that the diſeaſe come from them, as ſtinking ſowr Breath, itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Noſe, pain of the Belly, earthy Excrements, grating of the teeth, ſleepineſs, and the like, eſpecially if ſomtimes worms are voided.</p>
                     <p>But the extraordinary Cauſes, as Impoſthumation, foulneſs of a Bone, ſtopping of urine, and the like, may be taken from their proper ſigns.</p>
                     <p>As to the Prognoſtick, An Epilepſy is a Diſeaſe of long continuance, and very ſtubborn and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Infants.</p>
                     <p>An Epilepſy coming haereditary is incurable; but that which comes from external cauſes, and evil diet, is curable.</p>
                     <p>An Epilepſy coming before fourteen yeers of age in Boyes, and twelve in Girls, is curable: after twenty five yeers of age it is incurable; out of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> Aph. 7. Sect. 5. For in the time of ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49088:26"/>
of Age, there is great ſtore of Natural heat, which is powerful to diſcuſs-Diſeaſes. Moreover at that time women begin to have their terms, by which the uncleanneſs of the Body is purged. Yet although <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſuppoſed an Epilepſy to be incurable after twenty five yeers of age; yet this is not alwaies true, for we find by experience that many have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> been cured after, although but ſeldom ſeen; therefore we may ſay that the Aphoriſm is true for the moſt part, A ſtrong Epilepſy often killeth the Patient in the fit, or it turns into an Apoplexy, or by reaſon of the ſtrength of the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes, and the violent ſhaking of the Brain, the Fabrick of the Body it is overthrown, and ſome parts thereof are broken, and it happens ſomtimes that pieces of the bones called Proceſſus Mammil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lares, come out of the Noſe.</p>
                     <p>An Epilepſy coming of Melancholly turns ſomtimes into madneſs, when the humor is ſent from the Ventricles of the Brain into the ſubſtance thereof.</p>
                     <p>The ſame humor when it is only in the Ventricles of the Brain, ſtopping them and paining them, cauſeth an Epilepſy: But when it offends the ſubſtance of the Brain which is the ſeat of the chief <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Hence <hi>Hippocrates, 6. epid. ſect. 8. text</hi> 40 ſaith, that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly men turn for the moſt part Epileptick, and Epileptick to Melancholly. But theſe Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes thus change in a two-fold reſpect; either by the change of the matter cauſing the Diſeaſe from its proper ſeat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo when one comes, another goes, or by the propagation of the matter, and then both remain.</p>

                     <p>You muſt often uſe the common purges, namely, the Pills, or Magiſtral Syrup once or twice a week if the Patients ſtrength will ſuffer them, and continue purging for divers Months: and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times uſe ſtronger purg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>For this cauſe, the Chymicks uſe Minerals, which draw the Humors from remoteſt parts, but not without much danger, eſpecially if they be not well prepared. But if good ſucceſs may be expected from theſe Chymical Medicines, it is to be found in Mercury or Quick-ſilver, either by its ſelf, or with Gold calcined in a Furnace of Sand, with a long continuance of fire, watching narrowly leſt any crude portion of him remain, which would make the Medicine very violent; otherwiſe it will work gently, if given in the quantity of four or five grains in Cochie Pills, or any Extract that purgeth flegm, or all humors.</p>
                     <p>A new Epilepſy is ſomtimes cured with Salt of Vitriol; as <hi>Angelus Sala</hi> ſaith, that he hath cured at thrice taking of it, an Epilepſy, giving it every fourth day. And after in his 77. <hi>Gurat. Gent.</hi> 2. he
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49088:27"/>
boaſts that he cured a Girl of eleven yeers of age, of an haereditary Epilepſy, with Stibium calcined, given only thrice.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quercitan</hi>'s Syrup of Tobacco, is very good for the Cure of the Epilepſy: But it is not to be uſed but by a wiſe Phyſitian, it is ſo vehement.</p>
                     <p>Inſtead of the Opiate before mentioned, this may be uſed, which is more Specifical.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of the conſerve of Roſemary flowers, Peony, and Bugloſs, of each half an ounce: Citron barks candied, two drams: of the pouder of Miſleto of the Oak, Peony ſeeds, and Elks Claw, of each half a dram: Mans skull that was not buried calcined white one dram and an half: Coral, Pearl, and Harts-horn prepared, of each four ſcruples: right Bezoar ſtone, one ſcruple:</hi> Diamoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu dulce, Diatrion ſantalon, <hi>of each two ſcruples: old Treacle, and</hi> Confectio de hyacintho, <hi>of each one dram: Spirit of Vitriol fifteen drops: With the Syrup of candied Citron barks, make an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate; of which take the quantity of an Acorn, or Filbert, drinking a little Cinnamon water after it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But this following is moſt powerful for the rooting out of the Diſeaſe after the Body is well purged.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of Conſerve of Bettony Flowers and Roſemary Flowers, of each two ounces and an half: Eringus Roots candied, and Mithridate, of each one ounce: the pouder of Saſſaphras ſix drams: Caſtoreum three drams: Mans Skull not buried, and Elks hoof, of each two drams: of the roots and ſeeds of Peony, and Gith ſeeds, wild Rue, and Pellitory, of each one dram: Oxymel as much as is ſufficient, make an Opiate, of which take two or three drams.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Opiate of <hi>Montagnus</hi> goes beyond all, by which many have been cured: It is made thus:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of the Roots of male Peony, Stoechas, and Pepper-wort, of each ten drams: Agarick five drams: Pellitory, Carua ſeeds, Dill, Aſſafoetida, and Ariſtolochia or round Birthwort two drams and an half: of the juyce of Squils, and Honey, of each one pound and two ounces: Boyl the Squils and Honey gently to a good conſiſtence; then ad the Pouders, and make an Electuary: of which, take two, three, or four drams, as age requires, continuing it twenty or thirty daies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After the uſe of the Epiſpaſtick Plaiſter, you muſt apply a Veſicatory to the fore part of the head, and a Cautery to the neck.</p>
                     <p>But a Seton or Skein of Silk drawn through the neck, draws the Humors more ſtrongly out of the Brain. And <hi>Fabricius Hildanus</hi> reports that he cured a Youth that had the Falling-ſickneſs every day, and had uſed all means he could get, in vain; and a Girl of eighteen yeers of age, born ſo, only by the continuance of a Seton.</p>
                     <p>If you conjecture that the vapors riſing from the parts below, and flying into the Brain, produce this diſeaſe, and nouriſh it; it is good to apply a Cauſtick to the fore part of the head, avoiding the Sutures: for <hi>Carolus Piſo</hi> reports that he cured two by ſo doing. Alſo if the Diſeaſe come from the inferior parts, the Waters of Germany called <hi>Aquae Acidulae</hi> do work wonders, and ſomtimes root out the Diſeaſe, if firſt evacuations have been ſufficiently made, and the veins inferior have been opened.</p>
                     <p>But an Epilepſy coming from the Matrix requires a ſpecial Cure.</p>
                     <p>The Pouder of Elder Berries deſcribed by <hi>Quercetanus,</hi> given three daies together, the quantity of a dram with ſome Hyſterical Water, is good.</p>
                     <p>If al means fail, the laſt remedy is, to open the fore part of the Skul with a Trepan, at diſtance from the Sutures, that the evil air may breath out. By this means many times deſperate Epilepſies have been cured, and it may be ſafely done if the Chyrurgeon be skilful.</p>
                     <p>Let the Patient drink ordinarily Hydromel, or a ſmal Decoction of Guajacum with Peony Roots.</p>
                     <p>Let him carry a Bag about his Neck made thus:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of Peony Roots and Miſleto of the Oak, of each one ounce: Elks hoof two drams: Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megs, Cloves, and Mace, of each two drams: Rue and Hyſop, of each one dram and an half: Pouder them and put them in red Sarſnet to be bung about his neck that he may often ſmel to it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After Univerſal Evacuations, among other Medicines you muſt uſe Specifical Medicines, which you may find in many Authors. We ſhal ſet down ſome of the beſt (beſides thoſe Opiates preſcribed) which are of no ſmal Conſideration in the Cure of this Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rondeletius</hi> commendeth much the Water of Swallows, which <hi>Quercetanus</hi> borrowed of him in his Diſpenſatory. Treacle Water is of no leſs value, and <hi>Aqua Cephalica,</hi> and <hi>Syrupus Antepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepticus,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Quercetanus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Root of wild Valerian is much commended by <hi>Fabius Columna,</hi> that (once or twice taken) it cures the Epilepſy. And he reports he gave it to many of his friends, who affirmed that (under God) they were cured by it. The Doſe is half a ſpoonful in Wine, Water, Milk, or any other
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49088:27"/>
proper Liquor; but it is given to Children in a leſs quantity in Milk.</p>
                     <p>The Chymiſts commend the Spirital mixture, than which no better Medicine can be required (as they ſay.) The Compoſition whereof is as followeth:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of the ſpirit of Vitriol, one part; ſpirit of Tartar, three parts; Treacle Water with Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire, four parts: Mix them, and let them ſtand in a glaſs well ſtopped three or four weeks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Doſe is one dram in any proper Liquor, or Vehiculum to ſwallow it down with.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rulandus</hi> uſed much the <hi>Oleum ligni Heraclei</hi> (which the Chymiſts affirm to be of Coryline, or the Oyl of the Hazel-nut, or Filbert tree) And in his Centuries he relates ſome paſſages of them, which by the uſe of the Medicine were cured. The Doſe is three or four drops in any proper Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor for five daies together.</p>
                     <p>The Oyl of white Amber is inferior to none, if not the beſt, being drawn by a good Artificer, and ſmelling of no fire, but ſending forth a moſt fragrant ſcent. The Doſe is from half a ſcruple, to one ſcruple.</p>
                     <p>The Oyl of Box-tree taken by four drops at a time, in four ounces of the Water of the Tile-tree flowers with four drops of the Spirit of Sulphur for ſome certain daies together, is very powerful, and is thought by many to be the true Oyl of <hi>Lignum Heraclei.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Crato</hi> calls the Natural Cinnaber the Load-ſtone of the Epilepſy, and makes this Pouder of it.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of Natural Cinnaber, or Vermilion, which is cleer, and finely poudred half an ounce: red Coral, and Pearls prepared, of each two ſcruples: Saffron one ſcruple: the Leaves of Gold five: Grind them all very finely upon a ſtone.</hi> The Doſe is from ſix grains to a ſcruple in the time of the fit, in ſome proper Liquor.</p>
                     <p>The Cinnaber or Vermilion or Antimony, which is taken after the extraction of <hi>Mercurius vitae,</hi> is thought by Chymiſts to be of no leſs vertue than the former: for if it be mixed with an equal weight of the Magiſtery of Pearl, Coral, and pouder of a dead Mans Skull, it is a ſpecifical Medicine in an Epilepſy; though it be old, the Doſe is from ten grains to fifteen in a proper Liquor.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of an Epilepſy by conſent is firſt to begin with the part affected, and that part is to be clenſed and ſtrengthened by convenient Medicines taken out or thoſe proper Chapters wherein they are mentioned: not omitting Specifical and Antepileptical Medicines, which are alwaies to be uſed in every Medicine. But if the Epilepſy come from any external part, beſides the Univerſal Cure, we muſt have a ſpecial eye to that, and the malignant matter therein contained, is to be evacuated by Cupping-glaſſes with ſcarrification, Veſicatories, and Cauteries. And if the Diſeaſe continue after the Ephar or Scab is fallen off, you muſt apply the Cupping glaſſes again; and at laſt, when neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty urgeth, you muſt apply an actual Cautery. If the diſeaſe come from a foulneſs of the Skul, that is to be taken away with the Trepan and burning.</p>

                     <p>Firſt therefore make the Belly ſoluble with a Suppoſitory or Clyſter.</p>
                     <p>After, or about the ſame time, give a purging Medicine proportionable to the ſtrength of the child: We need not fear to give of the Electuary of Diacarthamum two drams to a child of one yeer old, if the Diſeaſe come of corrupt Milk.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Hiera Picra haly a ſcruple, or one ſcruple:</hi> Pulvis de gutteta <hi>half a ſcruple: Give it with a proper Liquor, or with Honey of Roſes.</hi>

                     <p>Apply Cupping glaſſes to the Shoulders and Loyns, and with Scarrification, if the Child be one or two yeers old.</p>
                     <p>Apply a Veſicatory to the hinder part of the Neck.</p>
                     <p>If the Purgation have not done well, or little profited, you muſt vomit with white Vitriol prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or with Salt of Vitriol, which may be given twice, thrice, or four times, if the Diſeaſe encreaſe. The Epileptick Pouder commonly called <hi>de gutteta,</hi> may be given often with Milk or Broth, from half a ſcruple to a ſcruple.</p>
                     <p>That Epileptick Pouder is not found written in our Diſpenſatory; but in the Shops at <hi>Montpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lior.</hi> It is uſually compounded thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

the ſeed of Atriplex or Orage, two drams: the Pouder of Mans Skull, three drams: red Coral pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, Hyacinths prepared, of each one dram and an half: Elks hoof prepared, half an ounce: Musk one ſcruple: Leaf Gold one dram: Mix them into Pouder.</hi>

                     <p>Take it in a ſmal ſpoonful of Water againſt the Epilepſy: or inſtead thereof in Cinnamon Water, or Imperial Water, or with ſome drops of the ſpirital mixture with a proper Liquor.</p>
                     <p>Apply to the hinder part of the head, a Plaiſter of Ammoniacum, the hair being ſhaven; for it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders a flux of humors that fals from the Head upon the back bone outwardly.</p>
                     <p>Uſe this Pouder to the fore part of the head.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Nutmeg half a dram: Peony ſeeds, one dram and an half: Lavender flowers, one pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil: Amber two ſcruples: Make a Pouder.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or apply the ſtrengthening Plaiſter preſcribed in the Cure of the cold diſtemper of the Brain.</p>
                     <p>Two or three drops of Oyl of Amber with an equal quantity of Spirit of Vitriol given in Bettony Water, do preſently free a child from a ſit of the Falling-ſickneſs. The ſame Oyl is good to anoint the Noſtrils. Inſtead of Oyl of Amber, give the Oyl of Box; as alſo the Water of Tile-tree flowers, and Bettony Water.</p>
                     <p>The ſmoak of Tobacco doth free children from the Epilepſy, if you put in the ſmal end of the Pipe into the childs Mouth, and blow in the ſmoak, or if you blow it from your mouth.</p>
                     <p>Let the Back bone and the Members contracted be anointed with this Liniment:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Oyl of Rue, and of Earth-worms, of each two ounces: Oyl of Caſtor one dram: a little Aqua vitae, make a Liniment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Old Treacle, one dram; Confection of Alkermes, and Hyacinths, of each one ſcruple; Bettony, Sage, Marjoram, and Cinnamon Water, of each half an ounce: 'Mix them, and hath therewith the Noſtrils, Temples, and Ears. You may alſo give a ſpoonful to be drunk.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But it is better to anoint the Noſtrils, Temples, and Crown of the Head with the Apoplectick Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom deſcribed for ſleepy Diſeaſes; as alſo the Mouth and Pallat.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Skenkius</hi> in his 5. Century of Exotick Experiments, num. 85. hath this Receipt out of <hi>George Kufner: This is an approved Medicine in Childrens Epilepſies: Give a little fine Musk in thin Wine, twice or thrice in a day, and it will cure perfectly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>While theſe things are performing, you muſt give once or twice in a day, a Clyſter, thus made:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take of the Roots of round Birthwort, of Polipody of the Oak, of Carthamus ſeeds, of each half an ounce: Peony and Cummin ſeeds, of each three drams: the flowers of Chamomel and and Roſemary, of each one pugil: Boyl them to one pint; take half a pint of it ſtrained; Hiera picra three drams; Honey of Roſemary one ounce; Oyl of Rue and Lillies, of each three drams.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Two ſpecial things are to be practiced:</p>
                     <p>The one is the Root of wild Valerian before commended by <hi>Columna;</hi> which he ſaith he hath given poudered in Milk, and thereby cured very many.</p>
                     <p>Another is the Gall of a ſucking Puppy, which is mentioned in <hi>Untzerus,</hi> thus: <hi>Take a little black ſucking Puppy (but for a Girl take a bitch Whelp) choak it, open it, and take out the Gall, which hath not above three or four drops of pure choller; give it all to the child in the time of the fit with a little Tile-tree-flower Water, and thou ſhalt ſee him cured as it were by a miracle pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the Child ſuck, look that the Nurſes Milk be good, let her have meat of good juyce, and light of digeſtion: Let her drink no Wine, but Water, or Water and Honey, and a ſmal drink made of Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaparilla.</p>
                     <p>Some Children are ſo ſubject to this Diſeaſe, that it will return again after it is once cured. Nay, in ſome Families al the Children uſe to die of this Diſeaſe. Therefore you muſt uſe preventing Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, not only to thoſe which are newly born, but to thoſe alſo which have recovered.</p>
                     <p>Firſt therefore give to Children newly born, before they ſuck, give one ſcruple of the Pouder <hi>de gutteta,</hi> mentioned before, in a little milk, and give the ſame quantity thrice in two daies.</p>
                     <p>It is good both for them which have been cured, and children when they are a few daies old to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a Cauſtick to their Necks. But an actual Cautery is much better, which our Phyſitians wil not uſe, becauſe they abhor violent and terrible Medicines. <hi>Rondeletius</hi> affirms, that the Actual Cautery is ſo uſed in <hi>Florence,</hi> that the women do uſe to apply it themſelves. And this doth <hi>Aquapendens</hi> witneſs in his Chyrurgery Operations, and teacheth the way of applying them in his proper Chapter of the burning of the hinder part of the head in children.</p>
                     <p>Let the Child be purged twice in a month, with Manna, Syrup of Roſes, or of Cichory with Rhubarb.</p>
                     <p>Every new Moon give it a doſe of the Epileptick Pouder <hi>de gurteta</hi> above mentioned.</p>
                     <p>Make a Bag to ſtrengthen the head, and a Fume for the Head-cloaths, as in the cure of cold Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the head; and alſo pouder its hair with the pouder before mentioned.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="35" facs="tcp:49088:28"/>For the Cure of this Diſeaſe, this is a good Preſervative:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Spirit of Wine, four ounces: Spirit of Caſtor, one ounce: Peony Roots, three ounces: Let them be infuſed and ſtrained. Waſh the whol body of the child with it warmed.</hi>

                        <hi>Avertigo</hi> is a falſe Imagination, in which all objects, and the head it ſelf ſeem to turn round, ſo as the Patient often falls to the ground, unleſs he lay hold on ſome ſtay at hand.</p>
                     <p>It may be objected, That in a Vertigo, the Imagination is not hurt; for if it were ſo, the Patients would think the objects truly turned round; as men in Madneſs and Phrenzy do think what they imagine to be truly ſo. We anſwer, That in a Vertigo, the Reaſon is not hurt, which perceiveth the error of the Imagination; but in a Phrenzy, or Melancholly, the Reaſon is hurt as wel as the Imagination.</p>
                     <p>There are two ſorts of Vertigoes; the one ſimple, called in Greek <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>In both kinds the Sight is ſomwhat hurt, becauſe the Spirits which uſe to go directly to the Eyes, are moved out of order by the viſive Nerve, by reaſon whereof the Eye doth not ſo ſitly enjoy them. But in a dark Vertigo there is a more violent Motion of the Spirits, ſo that they come leſs to the Eyes, from whence the ſight is darkned or hindred.</p>
                     <p>The immediate Cauſe of a Vertigo, is the circumvolution of the Spirits coming of a vaporous matter or wind, which coming into the Ventricles of the Brain, and <hi>Plexus Choroides,</hi> diſturbs the Spirits, and makes them run round; whence the ſpecies of the Objects brought by thoſe ſpirits are moved in like manner; and ſo the objects themſelves ſeem to be moved alſo the ſame way. But here we may doubt, ſince a Vertigo is a ſymptom of a hurt action, and every action hurt depends immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon a Diſeaſe, how the Circumvolution of the Spirits can be the immediate cauſe of a Vertigo, when it can be referred to no kind of Diſeaſe. To which we thus anſwer, A Circumvolution of the Spirits, is a Diſeaſe in reſpect of Scituation; for at that time the Spirits do not keep that place or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition which they Naturally ought, but move preternaturally, and amiſs. And this Anſwer hath a weighty inſtance: For a Diſeaſe is an affection of a true part, but ſpirits are not true parts. We anſwer, That Axiome is not alwaies, but ſometimes true; according to <hi>Galen</hi> that which is principal and hinders the action of its ſelf, is the true Diſeaſe: We ſay that the word <hi>Part</hi> ought to be taken in a larger ſenſe, comprehending all thoſe things which go to the making up of the Body, and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hinders the action of any part, is called a Diſeaſe. So a yellow color in the Eye, hurts the ſight immediately, and therefore it is called a Diſeaſe in number; ſo a better ſavor in the tongue, and noiſe in the Ears, are Diſeaſes in number, in regard there is ſomething in thoſe parts beſides, which offendeth the actions. After the ſame manner is the Circumvolution of the Spirits, a Diſeaſe in Scituation or Poſition, for the Reaſon above mentioned.</p>
                     <p>But thoſe Vapors are ſent up from evil humors, not continually without intermiſſion, but by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs and going about, and at a diſtance, namely, as often as they are raiſed up by an external cauſe; and the humors are ſuch as uſe to produce vapors, namely, Blood, Choller, Flegm, and Melancholly, and the watery Humor; becauſe both a cold as well as a hot vapor, may cauſe a Vertigo; as <hi>Galen, 3. de loc. affect.</hi> chap. 8. and Comment. Aphor. 23. Sect. 3.</p>
                     <p>Theſe evil humors are either contained in the Brain, or in the inferior parts. Hence a two-fold Vertigo ariſeth, one Proper, the other by Conſent.</p>
                     <p>Wateriſh and flegmy humors heaped up in the Brain, ſend wind and vapors to its ventricles, which ſtirring about there, do cauſe a Vertigo. And ſo a proper Vertigo comes to be a forerunner of an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepſy, or Apoplexy.</p>
                     <p>But Humors contained in the inferior parts, eſpecially the ſtomach and the ſpleen, do eaſily ſend up Vapors to the head, which if they touch the Ventricles, and the Arteries, cauſe a Vertigo.</p>
                     <p>The external Cauſes are all ſuch things as will quickly diſſolve the Humors, and turn them to Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors, or make an inordinate motion in thoſe Vapors. Among which are reckoned by <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> Aphor. 17. Sect. 3. a South wind, and ſudden change of Air. To theſe ad the heat of the Sun, windy Meats, Garlick, Muſtard, Radiſh, Peaſe and Beans, Drunkenneſs, Gluttony, immoderare Exerciſe, and unſeaſonable, the ſuppreſſion of a wonted evacuation, Anger, Baths, Hunger, eſpecially in thoſe which are ful of bitter Choller, often turning of the Body round, long looking upon Wheels and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49088:29"/>
things that run round, and of Waters that run ſwift, looking down from a high place, a Fall, a ſtroak upon the Head, a Fracture, or depreſſion of the Skull, compreſſing and lying upon the Brain.</p>
                     <p>We ſhall lay down no Diagnoſis, or general ſigns to know this Diſeaſe by, becauſe it is of it ſelf manifeſt. Yet in particular we ſhal declare thoſe ſigns which ſhew the part affected that containeth the mine or matter of the Diſeaſe; as alſo thoſe which ſhew the humor offending.</p>
                     <p>Pain of the Head ſhews that a Vertigo cometh from a Diſeaſe of the Brain, which is a true or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Vertigo. Alſo Heavineſs, and the loſs of ſome Sence; as Dimneſs of ſight, noiſe in the Ears, thickneſs of hearing, decay of ſmelling and taſting; the beating of the Arteries of the Head when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts are free.</p>
                     <p>The ſigns that ſhew what the matter is that offendeth, are theſe: That abundance of flegm offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, is ſignified by a dulneſs of the internal and external Sences, heavineſs of Head, ſlowneſs of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, drouzineſs, much ſpitting, want of Appetite, want of Thirſt, white Urine, and crude, with the other ſigns of abundance of flegm.</p>
                     <p>But watchings, wrath, nimbleneſs in actions, thirſt, bitterneſs of mouth, quickneſs of pulſe, a thin and yellow Urine, and the like, ſhew that the Chollerick matter offendeth.</p>
                     <p>The ſigns of a Melancholly matter are, Fear, ſorrow, troubleſom thoughts, much watching, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful dreams, ſowr belchings, and the like.</p>
                     <p>The ſigns of Blood abounding, are, Stretching of the Veins with fulneſs, redneſs of face, and heat, beating of the Temples, heavineſs and diſtention in the head, long ſleep, dreams of red things, weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, reaching, thick and red Urine, ſomtimes thin and tranſparant by the aſcention of the blood into the head.</p>
                     <p>A Vertigo by Conſent is known by the want of thoſe Symptomes, which come from the Head, when no diſorder is found in the Brain, but rather ſome part beneath is ſenſibly hurt.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things ſhew that a Vertigo comes from the ſtomach, want of appetite, loathing, ſowr bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings, pain of the ſtomach, or ſwelling with wind.</p>
                     <p>That a Vertigo comes from the Liver, Spleen, or Matrix by Conſent, the ſame ſigns declare which were laid down in an Epilepſy by Conſent coming from the ſame parts in the Chapter aforegoing.</p>
                     <p>The Prognoſtick, or foreknowledg of this Diſeaſe, is thus:</p>
                     <p>A new Vertigo that comes but ſeldom, and which comes only from external Cauſes, is more light and eaſier cured: On the contrary, that which is old, and comes often, turneth for the moſt part in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Epilepſy, or Apoplexy.</p>
                     <p>A Vertigo in an old man is moſt dangerous, becauſe his Brain is colder and weaker, and flegm doth more abound.</p>
                     <p>A Vert go in which not only external things, but alſo the Head and whol Body ſeem to be turned about, and which happens with hurt to the ſight, is more dangerous, for it ſignifies greater force in the cauſe of it; and if the ſick man falls to the ground, it foretels an Epilepſy, or Apoplexy.</p>
                     <p>A Vertigo coming of hot Humors, is ſooner diſſolved than that which comes of cold, becauſe hot Humors are ſooner diſperſed.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of the Vertigo is much like that of the Epilepſy, becauſe both Diſeaſes come almoſt of the ſame Cauſes: whence it comes that a Vertigo often turns into an Epilepſy. But becauſe a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigo is a lighter Diſeaſe, it doth not need ſo many Medicines as an Epilepſy: but they will ſerve, which we will here lay down; and alſo we ſhal demonſtrate in ſhort what is that which this Diſeaſe moſt properly requireth for its Cure.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place, Therefore if blood abound in the whol body, or in the head, you muſt open a Vein, and let the blood out by degrees, giving before a Clyſter that is ſomwhat ſharp.</p>
                     <p>After that, give the ordinary Purge which is preſcribed in the Cure of the cold Diſtemper of the Brain.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards we muſt come to the particular Evacuations of the Brain, by Errhines, Sternutatories, and Gargariſms, or Apophlegmatiſms, mentioned in the firſt Chapter.</p>
                     <p>Cupping glaſſes dry, and with Scarrification; Frictions of the extream parts, and opening of the Hemorrhoids are to be uſed for to cauſe revulſion.</p>
                     <p>Apply Veſicatories and Cauteries for derivation, and at laſt uſe thoſe things which ſtrengthen the Brain, and diſperſe Vapors and Humors as well externally as internally, as Opiates, Pouders, and Bags that are deſcribed in the firſt Chapter.</p>
                     <p>And you muſt not omit the digeſtive Pouder, becauſe the weakneſs of the Stomach often cauſeth this Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly, You muſt uſe thoſe Medicines which are eſteemed by ſpecial quality to cure the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigo; ſuch as are thoſe which were preſcribed for the Cure of the Epilepſy; namely, Antepileptick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Waters, a Balſom to anoint the Noſtrils, Temples, and Crown of the head, Oyl of Amber, Pouder of Cinnaber, and many other.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, <hi>Quercetanus</hi> in the twentieth Chapter of his Diſpenſatory, commends a Medicine
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49088:29"/>
made of Peacocks dung, whoſe Preparation and manner of uſe, may be ſeen in the Author.</p>
                     <p>If the Diſeaſe do obſtinately reſiſt the propounded Remedies, you muſt fall to a Diet of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Guajacum.</p>

                     <p>It is called a depraved motion from <hi>Galen, 2. de ſympt. cauſ.</hi> chap. 1. and he ſaies the ſame in his Book of the Difference of Symptomes, chap. 3. but he ſeems to contradict himſelf, when in his Book of Trembling, chap. 4. he reckons Trembling among the Motions which are diminiſhed. But that contradiction may be reconciled, by ſaying, that Motion may be conſidered two waies, Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in reſpect of it ſelf, or in reſpect of the faculty: If it be conſidered in reſpect of it ſelf, it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, becauſe it is not in that manner it ought to be; if it be conſidered in reſpect of the faculty, it is a deminiſhed motion, becauſe it comes from a faculty ſo weak that it cannot produce motion ſtrong enough. But one may inſtance, That the action is alwaies diminiſhed when comes from a weak facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but never depraved. I anſwer, That it is true if al the actions depend upon the faculty; but Trembling comes partly from the Faculty, partly from the heavineſs of the part; therefore it is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved Motion.</p>
                     <p>The moving faculty deſireth to lift up the Member, and to keep it in that Poſition; but the weight of the Member preſſeth it downwards, whence comes a trembling Motion.</p>
                     <p>The Mediate Cauſe of Trembling, is weakneſs of the Motive Faculty, or rather of its neareſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, that is, the Animal Spirit, which is not able to exerciſe a voluntary Motion perfectly.</p>
                     <p>The Spirits are made weak, either by a fault in themſelves, or by a defect in the Nerves, which are the Conduit Pipes by which they are carried, and do act.</p>
                     <p>The fault is in the Spirits, either when they are but few at the firſt; or when they are afterwards diſſipated.</p>
                     <p>They are few at the firſt, either by reaſon of the cold diſtemper of the Brain, as in old men, or through the want of vital Spirits, which are the matter of which the animal are made.</p>
                     <p>The Spirits are diſſipated from many external Cauſes, as immoderate Evacuations, much uſe of Venery and unſeaſonable, great pain, and conſtant faſting, ſorrow, and long violent Diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>The Spirits are hurt by defect in the Nerves, and are weakned either when the Nerves are too cold, or are infected with a malignant quality, or obſtructed or compreſſed.</p>
                     <p>They grow too cold, either from a cold Air, from uſe of cold meats, or much drinking of Water, ſwimming often in cold water, and the like.</p>
                     <p>They are infected by the uſe of Opium, Henbane, Poppy, and the vapor of Quick-ſilver, as it is ſeen in Gold-ſmiths, and them which have the French Pox, and have been cured with the fume of Cinnaber. So in malignant Feavers tremblings come alſo (which are rather to be accounted Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive Motions) and alſo they come from the provocation or irritation of the Nervous parts.</p>
                     <p>They are ſtopped not wholly, as in a Palſey, but much leſs, but by the ſame cauſe, namely a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery humor gently ſprinkled upon the Nerves, which is produced of gluttony, drunkenneſs, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cauſes.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Trembling may come from compreſſion of the Nerves, when excrementitious humors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding in the whol Body do compreſs the Nerves, and hinder the free paſſage of the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hercules Saxonia,</hi> beſides the cauſes mentioned borrowed from <hi>Galen,</hi> acknowledgeth another <hi>Tremor</hi> coming of wind; and <hi>Cardanus</hi> another from pain in nervous parts: But they are deceived, becauſe the Motion produced from thoſe Cauſes, are to be referred to Palpitation, or Convulſive Motion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="38" facs="tcp:49088:30"/>There is no need of ſigns in this diſeaſe, becauſe trembling appears of it ſelf: But the Cauſes that produce it, are to be known by their proper ſigns; as alſo we muſt ſearch for thoſe external Cauſes which went before.</p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſtick. Trembling of it ſelf is not dangerous, but if it be in old people it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth with them til they die. But it may be deadly by accident, in as much as it uſually goes before a Palſey, or an Apoplexy.</p>
                     <p>You muſt Cure Trembling as you cure the Palſey, and therefore we ſhall not make vain repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Medicines.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Of <hi>Phrenitis,</hi> or Phrenzie.</head>
                     <p>A Phrenzy is an Inflamation of the Brain, and its Membranes with a continual dotage, and a a ſharp conſtant Feaver.</p>
                     <p>By the word <hi>Inflamation,</hi> we underſtand a true Tumor, which is commonly called a contracted Inflamation, coming of Blood out of the Veſſels falling upon the ſubſtance of the part; for the Blood being hot and Chollerick, and in the Membranes or ſubſtance of the Brain, cauſeth a true <hi>Eryſipelas,</hi> or an <hi>Eryſipelas Phlegmonodes,</hi> or <hi>Phlegmon Eryſipelatodes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By <hi>Delirium,</hi> or Doting, we underſtand the erring of Reaſon, for we ſuppoſe that fault cannot be in the Imagination alone, without a fault be in the Reaſon, in a Phrenzy; whatſoever others think, we are led by the Authority of <hi>Galen,</hi> who in his Book of the Difference of Symptomes, chap. 3. gives an Example of one <hi>Theophilus</hi> a Phyſitian, who thought Fidlers ſate continually in a corner of his houſe playing, and beleeved that he ſaw them ſomtimes ſtanding, ſomtimes ſitting, and cried continually that they ſhould be caſt out of doors. And <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, that in him the Imagination was hurt without the Reaſon. Firſt therefore we may ſay that <hi>Theophilus</hi> had not a Phenzy; for <hi>Galen</hi> doth not ſay that he had, but ſpeaking of a Delirium (which <hi>Theophilus</hi> had) therefore it was rather Melancholly, becauſe they ſomtimes err in one object, and diſcourſe wel concerning other: ſo ſaith <hi>Galen</hi> of <hi>Theophilus,</hi> that he had wiſdom in other things, both to diſcourſe, and to know his friends. But we ſay further of <hi>Theophilus,</hi> that not only his Imagination, but alſo his Reaſon was hurt, becauſe he really thought the Fidlers were there, and deſired they ſhould be put forth: For when the Imagination alone is hurt, the Reaſon being not hurt, acknowledgeth the error of Imagination, as in a Vertigo, in which the Patient thinks al things run round, but Reaſon knoweth that it is not ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but that Imagination doth err.</p>
                     <p>Nor is the Opinion of <hi>Euſtachius Rudius</hi> to be received in this caſe, who ſaith, That it never comes to paſs that the Imagination ſhould be hurt, the Reaſon being ſound, becauſe Reaſon wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth upon Phantaſms received from the Imagination, and therefore if fooliſh Phantaſms are offered to the Reaſon, he thinks it neceſſary that the Underſtanding beholding thoſe fooliſh fanſies, ſhould alſo be fooliſh: And hence <hi>Euſtachius</hi> gathers, that the Imagination is not depraved, but there is a meer and ſimple deceit of the ſight. We ſay that the underſtanding doth run from one thing to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and is buſied about thoſe Species which are retained in the Memory; and though the Fanſie preſents abſurdities to the Mind, yet the Species before received, are ſtill retained in the Memory, and are preſented to the Reaſon, it can know and correct that miſtake of the Fanſie; namely, if it judg that thoſe abſurd fanſies which are brought to it by a depraved Imagination do neither agree with time, place, or other circumſtances which ſtill remain in the Memory, and are known to be true. So in a Vertigo, Reaſon being in order judgeth that it is impoſſible that Roofs, Walls, and Pavements, ſhould turn round, and therefore they are falſly repreſented to the Imagination. So the Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher that was bit with a mad dog, and his Imagination began to decay, going into a Bath, perceived the falſe Image of a Dog therein; but Reaſon being ſound reproved the error of his Imagination, and made him ſpeak thus; What hath a Dog to do in a Bath? and preſently he caſt himſelf into the Bath, by which means he was delivered from the danger of a Diſeaſe called <hi>Hydrophobia,</hi> or fear of Water.</p>
                     <p>There are two kinds of Phrenzie; namely, a true Phrenzy, which is laid down in the Definition above mentioned: Another which is called <hi>Paraphrenitis,</hi> or Baſtard Phrenzy.</p>
                     <p>A true Phrenzy is ſomtimes in the Diſpoſition, which is moſt uſual, ſomtimes in the Habit, which is called Hectical Phrenzy, in which, the Chollerick Humors are ſtrongly fixed in the Brain, and poſſeſs many parts thereof, ſticking thereto like a tincture or dye.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Paraphrenitis,</hi> or baſtard Phrenzy is, when a hot diſtemper is communicated to the Brain, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the whol Body (as in burning Feavers) or from ſome part inflamed, as the Stomach,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49088:30"/>
Liver, Lungs, and eſpecially the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> or Midriff, which by inflamation doth produce a Diſeaſe very like a Phrenzy; namely, a cont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nual Dotage called <hi>Delirium;</hi> which cometh to paſs by the great conſent which is between the Brain and the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> through the Nerves that come thither, and by the perpetual motion of the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> or Midriff, by reaſon wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>reof continual vapors are ſent to the Brain.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſe of a true Phrenzy is Chollerick blood, to which there is joyned alſo Excrementitious Choller, and this produceth a greater or leſs Phrenzy according to its divers degrees; namely in heat and aduſtion. So a Pale Choller produceth the mildeſt Phrenzy, and an Aduſt or burnt Choller ſtirs up a beſtial Phrenzy.</p>
                     <p>But when the Brain is inflamed, and the Membranes thereof; the Chollerick blood is out of its Veſſels, and ſhed abroad into the ſubſtance of thoſe parts: which is done Two wayes, either when the Brain is principally affected; or when it is affected by Sympathy.</p>
                     <p>The Brain is primarily affected when it doth immediately grow hot from an external Cauſe, as from the Sun-beams, drinking of Wine, Wrath, and the like; ſo that the blood which is contained in the veins of the Brain is moved and carried out of its Veſſels: and this may come from a wound, or ſtroak, or contuſion of the head: And a Phrenzy ſo coming may be called a primary, or princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Phrenzy.</p>
                     <p>But a ſecondary Phrenzy is that which follows burning and malignant Feavers, when a part of that humor which cauſeth the Diſeaſe, is carried to the head.</p>
                     <p>It followeth many times in theſe Feavers, That Nature being diſturbed by the malignity of the Cauſe which maketh the Diſeaſe, ſends ſome portion thereof to ſome fleſh between the skin and the bone; whence we ſee Plureſies, ſhortneſs of Breathings, Squinſeys, Hipatitides, or Inflamations from the <hi>Vena porta,</hi> and other parts, to follow theſe Feavers: So if theſe humors are ſent to the Brain they make a true Phrenzy, and then the Feaver goes before the <hi>Delirium,</hi> or doting: But in primary Phrenzies a <hi>Delirium</hi> appears with the Feaver from the beginning.</p>
                     <p>The Signs which declare a Phrenzy to come are theſe, watchings, troubleſome ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

There is a pain about the hinder part of the head, becauſe the jugular veins are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to that part and ſend forth the Chollerick blood.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the ſigns of a Phrenzy preſent: a continual doting, becauſe the Brain is alwayes affected: troubleſome watchings coming from the hot diſtemper of the Brain; ſeldom and great violent brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, becauſe men in Phrenzies forget to breath: for when by forgetfulneſs, or great trouble of the mind by many fancies which are preſented to a doting imagination, and with-draw the animal ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: Reſpiration, or breathing is very ſeldom, it is made up with the greatneſs of the blaſt.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, in a Phrenzy there is no thirſt, or very little; albert there are ſtrong cauſes of thirſt preſent, becauſe the mind is ſick, and the animal ſpirits (by reaſon the Brain is hurt) do not ſend their beams to the mouth of the ſtomack wher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Pulſe is weak becauſe the heart ſuffers with the brain: hard; becauſe the <hi>Membrana</hi> is inflamed: quick and often; by reaſon of the great urging; and ſomthing moiſt; becauſe the brain is affected. Moreover, there is a continual Feaver becauſe the inflamation of the brain muſt of neceſſity cauſe a Feaver. The tongue is rough, black, and yellow, by reaſon of the Chollerick vapors which dry up its moiſture.</p>

Little; becauſe the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> or Midriff being inflamed, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaſily be extended and dilated. Often; for neceſſity, that the ſmalneſs might be made good by the frequency. Moreover, in a true Phrenzy the voyce is high, and the Patient cryes out loud; in the other the voice is low, becauſe the inſtrument of Breathing is hindered. And laſtly, In the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamation of the Midriff, the <hi>Hypocondria</hi> are drawn up (according to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in <hi>Coacis</hi>) and the reaſon is, becauſe the Midriff is covered beneath with a <hi>Membrana</hi> coming from the <hi>Peritone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um;</hi> and therefore when it is inflamed, it contracts the <hi>Peritoneum,</hi> and with it the <hi>Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria.</hi>

                     <p>The greateſt hope of recovery is when there is Dotage with laughter, and a decreaſe of Symptoms, continuance of ſtrength; as alſo when after the height of the Diſeaſe there happeneth ſome benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al evacuation, as ſweat, blood, or looſeneſs.</p>
                     <p>But theſe ſhew the Diſeaſe to be deadly. The Tongue quavering, and Hand trembling, gnaſhing of Teeth, Convulſion, a great Chilneſs or Cold in the beginning of the Diſeaſe; as alſo when the Patient picketh the Wooll or Straws about his bed. You may farther Collect Death to be at hand by a drop of black blood flowing from the Noſtrils, by white ſtools, white and thin urine: For al theſe ſignifie a great oppreſſion of the Brain, or a flowing of Choller from the whole body to the part affected.</p>
                     <p>For the Cure of this Diſeaſe, the blood that flows to the Head muſt be let forth, and revelled, derived, repelled, and intercepted; and that which was there before muſt be evacuated and diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. The diſtemper of that part muſt be corrected; the ſtrength of it, and of the whole body is to be preſerved.</p>
                     <p>All theſe things may be done with the following Medicines.</p>
                     <p>In the beginning of the Diſeaſe, at any time of the day you muſt let blood out of the Head vein, becauſe the Diſeaſe is very violent, giving a Clyſter before: or if blood do much abound, out of the Liver vein: or firſt, out of the middle vein; and a little after out of the Head vein.</p>
                     <p>If the Diſeaſe come from ſtoppage of the Terms or Hemorrhoids upon the vein called <hi>Saphena</hi> in the foot. In the next place you muſt open the <hi>Chephalick</hi> or Head vein, that you may draw forth what is received into the brain, or what is nigh unto it.</p>
                     <p>For the moſt part once bleeding wil not be ſufficient in this Diſeaſe, but twice or thrice, or oftener in the beginning or encreaſe of the Diſeaſe; you may adventure upon it, according to the condition or plenty of the Humor; the age, temper, and ſtrength of the patient.</p>
                     <p>If a Phrenzy taketh one that hath a conſtant Feaver, (as it is often in the encreaſe of Feavers, or in the ſtate of them, when nature is out of order and diſturbed by the malignity of that matter which cauſeth the Diſeaſe, ſendeth Chollerick humors to the head) you muſt again let blood, though you have done it before in reſpect of the Feaver; but you muſt do it ſparingly, becauſe the ſtrength is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated by the Feaver and former bleeding. Therefore at that time open the Head vein, or if ſtrength wil not bear that, open the <hi>Saphena</hi> in one foot, or both; which is approved in ſuch Diſeaſes: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it leſs beneficial to open the Hemorrhoid veins by Leeches.</p>
                     <p>But in all Bleedings which are made in time of a <hi>Delirium,</hi> you muſt obſerve this that the Orifice be not large, for then it wil quickly heal, and you muſt bind it up carefully leſt the Patient being unruly cauſe it to bleed again; as alſo 'tis very good for the ſudden Cure of it, to lay a plaiſter of Aloes, white of an Eg, and the hair of a Hare.</p>
                     <p>After Bleeding provoke ſleep. For if after bleeding there comes watchfulneſs, the Humors wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And they are thus made,</p>

                     <p>You muſt not Purge in a primary Phrenzy, ſuch a one as comes not from another Diſeaſe, but it is good ſomtimes to Purge when the Phrenzy comes upon a continual Feaver. For if there be an evil digeſtion or ill juyce in the Body, and the Phrenzy begin: then the matter is wandering, and is taken for that which is called <hi>Turgent,</hi> or abounding: And therefore by the Counſel of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> Aphor. 22. Sect. 1. is to be preſently evacuated.</p>
                     <p>But the Purge muſt be made of cold things, with gentle, as Senna, Rhubarb, Caſſia, Tamarinds, Catholicon, and Syrup of Roſes.</p>

                     <p>Concerning theſe cooling Medicines, you muſt obſerve that they be adminiſtred warily, and with judgment, becauſe the Brain is of its own Nature cold, and a principal Member, therefore it is to be feared left the Patient by too much uſe thereof ſhould fall into a contrary Diſeaſe, as a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, or the like, eſpecially if he be weak or old; and although they are uſed ſomtimes more, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times leſs, yet the extent of the time of their uſage ought not to be above three daies.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, Thoſe Medicines do ſtick to the face and eyes, therefore you muſt lay about them a cloth, or a little wool: in the fore part of the head you muſt apply them to the middle of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head; in the ſides of the head, above the ears; in the hinder part, about the nape of the neck and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the crown of the head: and theſe are in Winter, to be applied hot; in Summer, cold, as <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> ſaith, 2. <hi>de comp. med. cap.</hi> 2.

                     <p>While theſe things are doing, you muſt uſe al thoſe things which do cool the whol Body, eſpecially the principal parts both internally and externally.</p>
                     <p>Inwardly you muſt uſe Juleps, Emulſions, and Electuaries.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Penotus</hi> doth extol this Epitheme:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Musk twelve grains; Camphire twenty grains; red Roſe water in which Sanders hath been infuſed, twenty ounces; mix them: Shave the head, and wet double cloaths therein, and apply them warm to all the Sutures of the head. When they are dry wet them again, and continue the application twenty four hours, and ſo doing you ſhall provoke ſleep, ſtrengthen the brain, and wonderfully recover the Patient, except the very ſubſtance of the brain be corrupted.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Inwardly you may give one ounce of Syrup of Poppies ſomtimes in his Juleps and Emulſions.</p>
                     <p>Or you may give four or five grains of Laudanum, which alſo given in a Clyſter, doth provoke ſufficiently to ſleep, and with more ſafety.</p>
                     <p>The Phyſitian muſt be wary in the uſe of Narcoticks, or Medicines that provoke ſleep; for they
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49088:32"/>
muſt not be given if the Patient be very weak, leſt the Spirits and Natural heat, be thereby extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed.</p>
                     <p>Having ſufficiently uſed Evacuations, Revulſions, Derivations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Interceptions: we muſt come to the bringing forth of the matter. And firſt we muſt open the forehead vein if it appear, and may be taken, not tying a Ligature about the Neck as uſually they do, for ſo the blood will be forced upwards.</p>
                     <p>But you may with moſt profit open the veins in the noſtrils, and if the Diſeaſe be any waies cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, it will be cured thus: You muſt bleed plentifully, and betimes, in the beginning of the Diſeaſe, after you have made general Evacuations. And they are opened with Briſtles put up into the Noſe, and pricking often therewith.</p>
                     <p>Or you may draw blood from behind the Ears, from the Noſtrils, Forehead, Hemorrhoids, with Horſ-letches.</p>
                     <p>Apply to the Head, things that reſolve, with things that repel, in that proportion, that firſt you uſe a little of the reſolvers, and as the diſeaſe declineth, encreaſe the quantity, ſo that at length you uſe only reſolvers to diſcuſs the reliques of the Diſeaſe. For this end we uſe Oyl of Chamomel, and of Dill mixed with Oyl of Roſes.</p>
                     <p>But among Reſolving Medicines, the chiefeſt are Creatures newly killed and applied to the head, or pieces of them; as yong Pidgeons, Chickens, Puppies cut along the Back, and Sheeps Lights; for they fortifie the part with their Natural heat, diſcuſs the humor, and qualifie the ſharpneſs thereof.</p>
                     <p>Which things, if you have tried one or two daies, and have found no benefit, <hi>Mercatus</hi> teacheth to apply a Cupping glaſs to the crown of the head, that the humors may breath through the Sutures into the Skin: and if it appear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>red, and be ſwelled under the Cupping glaſs to ſcarifie. This Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel he ſaith (if followed) wil do good when al things beſides fail; eſpecially if you bath preſently after with ſweet Water in which you have boyled ſome diſcuſſing Medicines: But he adviſeth that this be not uſed in Phrenzies that come from other Feavers, but only in that which beginneth of its ſelf.</p>
                     <p>This Remedy is confirmed by <hi>Zacutus Lucitanus,</hi> who ſaies that he cured a moſt deſperate Phrenzy by applying a Cupping Glaſs to the fore part of the Head with Scarrification.</p>
                     <p>Some are ſo bold as to apply Veſicatories, or Medicines to raiſe Bliſters to the fore part of the Head, which they ſay hath ſomtimes had ſucceſs: But this requires extraordinary premeditation before it be uſed.</p>
                     <p>For his Drink, let the Patient uſe Barley Water, or Water made of Sorrel Roots, with Syrup of Pomegranates, Barberries, or Lemmons; or let him drink this following Infuſion.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Spring Water two pints; the Leaves of Sorrel, and wild Poppies, of each half a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; the Flowers of Borrage, Water-lillies, and Violets, of each half a pugil; the ſpirit of Vitriol one dram: red Sanders raſped two ſcruples: Let them be infuſed for ſome hours cold; then ſtrain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them with a Cap paper, and ad as much Sugar as is ſufficient to make it pleaſant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is in this Diſeaſe for the moſt part a ſtoppage of Urine, becauſe the Patient neglecteth to make it; from whence thoſe parts that contain it are diſtended, and bring ſo great an Inflamation, that it alone is able to bring death to the Patient. Therefore you muſt often call upon the Patient to make water, and you muſt foment the place where the Bladder lieth with warm Water, and drive the Urine forth by the compreſſion of the hand. But if the Symptomes do not yeild to theſe light Medicines, you muſt proceed to ſtronger.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Leaves of Pellitory of the wall two handfuls; Parſley with its roots, one handful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Boyl them, and after they are ſtrained ad three ounces of the Oyl of Scorpions, and foment the hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place of the Privities therewith.</hi>

                     <p>Let the remainder of this Decoction after the ſtraining, be fryed in a pan with the Oyl of Scorpions, and applied to the ſame part after the Fomentation.</p>
                     <p>If you deſire a ſtronger Decoction, ad the Seeds of Smallage, Parſley, Gromwel, Seſelis, or large and broad Cummin, of each two drams.</p>

                        <hi>Chap. XII.</hi> Of the Impoſthume, and <hi>Spacelus,</hi> or Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Brain.</head>
                     <p>THe Impoſthume and Mortification of the Brain is deſcribed by few Authors, although it was obſerved by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his 3. Book of Diſeaſes, and happeneth ſomtimes in Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and deluding thoſe Phyſitians who are not well grounded, making them conceive it to be another Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>Now a Spacelus, or Mortification of the Brain, is a ſuppuration, or corruption, or matter of the ſubſtance of the Brain, which is called a Gangrene, Syderation, or blaſting of the Brain.</p>
                     <p>The Immediate cauſe whereof, is an Inflamation of the ſubſtance of the Brain, which is diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed from a Phrenzy, in this: In a Phrenzy the Membranes are chiefly inflamed, and they do commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate an inflamation to the external part adjoyning; but in this Diſeaſe, the inward parts of the Brain are inflamed, and the whol ſubſtance thereof is putrified; for ſo great an inflamation in a moſt tender part and moiſt, will quickly produce a Spacelus, or Mortification.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſe of this Inflamation is Blood over-heated, or over chollerick, running into the Body and internal parts of the Brain.</p>
                     <p>The Primary Cauſes, are, all ſuch things as produce hot and much Blood in the whol Body which is ſent to the Brain; as violent Exerciſe, the heat of the Sun, heat of the head by Fire, Wrath, and the like: But great Wounds do more uſually produce this Diſeaſe, as alſo Contuſions. But a Spacelus or Impoſthume coming from a Wound or Contuſion, is different from the former in this: An Impoſthume made by a Fall or Contuſion, doth n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> poſſeſs ſo many parts of the Brain, but for the moſt part adhaereth to one. Hence the Symptomes are higher, eſpecially in the beginning, and the Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e continueth longer.</p>
                     <p>The S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>gns of an Impoſthume or Spacelus, which cometh without a Wound, or Contuſion, are theſe:</p>
                     <p>In the beginning there is a great Head-ach, which is communicated by the hinder part of the head to the neck and all the back; after which comes a general decay of all the Sences both internal and external, as in an Apoplexy, from which it is diſtinguiſhed by the Signs hereafter mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Patient is toſſed to and fro, and cannot remain in the ſame place; he layeth hold with his hands upon his head, and deſires to tear and ſcratch his face, plucking his hair: but as the Diſeaſe en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>reaſeth, his Body groweth faint, and cannot uſe ſuch violence.</p>
                     <p>A moſt ſharp and ſtrong Feaver alwaies accompanyeth this Diſeaſe, which comes from the great Inflamation of the brain.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, In this Diſeaſe, the Patient never takes meat or drink, neither can you take any courſe to give them any thing, and therefore their ſtrength ſoon faileth.</p>
                     <p>An Impoſthume by a Wound or Contuſion, is known by theſe ſigns following:</p>
                     <p>After the Wound or Contuſion is received, there is a kind of numbneſs and ſadneſs in the Body, the Animal Spirits beginning to be weakened by the matter which is got out of its Veſſel. When the Diſeaſe encreaſeth, there ariſeth a kind of Feaver, when the matter begins to putrifie, thence comes head-ach and drouzineſs: after, when putrefaction is encreaſed, al the ſymptomes grow ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the Feaver ſharper; the Patient riſing from ſleep ſuddenly roareth out, and then preſently lyeth down again; he often brings his hand to his head: Hence it is, that many before they die do ſend forth filthy green matter out of their mouth and noſe.</p>
                     <p>As to the Prognoſtick part thus:</p>
                     <p>This Diſeaſe is moſt dangerous, and commonly deadly, even in three daies ſpace, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſheweth in his 51. Aphoriſm, Sect. 7. ſaying, <hi>That they who have a mortified and putrified brain, die in three daies; but if they live longer, they recover. Galen</hi> in his Comments teacheth that we are not to underſtand here by a Spacelus, a compleat corruption of the Brain becauſe that is uncura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but ſuch as is at hand by reaſon of the great Inflamation.</p>
                     <p>In thoſe which recover, who are very few, there is no remembrance of things paſt: they can neither remember their Diſeaſe, nor any thing concerning it.</p>
                     <p>We muſt make great haſt for the Cure of this Diſeaſe, for if we do not apply Remedies in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, there is no time for Cure.</p>
                     <p>Therefore in the firſt beginning of this Diſeaſe we muſt let blood in great plenty, and very often twice, or thrice, or four times in the ſame day, as ſtrength will permit: for al the hope of the Cure lyeth in this only Remedy; for when a great quantity of blood poſſeſſeth the ſubſtance of the Brain, which is large, ſoft, and moiſt, we cannot make ſo great a revulſion from thence, except we
<pb facs="tcp:49088:33"/>
draw almoſt all the blood in the veins: and here that common ſaying of <hi>Celſus</hi> is to be obſerved; Many things are done well in time of ſudden danger, which at other times may be omitted.</p>
                     <p>You muſt alſo give ſharp Clyſters every day, that the humors which tend upwards may be brought down.</p>
                     <p>At the ſame time apply thoſe Medicines of Roſe Vinegar pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>cribed in the Chapter of Phrenzy.</p>
                     <p>For the greater revulſion and derivation, apply Cupping-glaſſes to the Shoulders and Back, with deep ſcarification; uſe Frictions and Ligatures to the extream parts: firſt open the Ankle Veins, then the Forehead, and the Arteries in the Temples; apply Horſ-leeches behind the Ears, and to the Hemorrhoids; Veſicatories to the Neck and Arms, and other Medicines which we preſcribed in the cure of the Phrenzy.</p>
                     <p>At laſt, if the Diſeaſe decline, you muſt apply to the head things that gently reſolve; among which, the beſt is, the hot Lungs of a Sheep newly ſlain.</p>

And Experience teacheth us that Madneſs happens often, not only in Melancholly men, but alſo in all Natures and Ages, eſpecially if it be haereditary, or come from Parents: and it is often cured by hot Medicines which have ſpecial vertue againſt it.

Sect. 6. where he ſaith, That the cauſe of a Mania is a Melancholly humor, not alwaies, but when it is burnt above meaſure, or when it is putrified, and hath received a malignant ſharpneſs. There remains yet one dimculty, That mad men can endure the coldeſt weather naked without hurt, and to be hot externally, which ſhews an extraordinary heat. But we anſwer, That this is not proper to all mad folks, for ſome can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:49088:34"/>
endure cold, but go as warm as they can. And the other are not diſturbed with the external air by reaſon of Cuſtom, becauſe from cuſtom there is no paſſion; ſo we ſee tender women in Winter go with naked Breaſts, which are hot to the touch, albeit according to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> cold is a great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to the Breaſt.</p>
                     <p>The matter producing this Diſeaſe, is contained in the veins and arteries, either of the whol body, or thoſe neereſt to the Brain, or in the veſſels of the Brain, and in reſpect of the difference of the place containing, greater or lighter ſymptomes do ariſe. Somtimes the matter cauſing this diſeaſe is in the Veſſels of the Matrix, as Blood, and Seed corrupted: hence cometh the raging called <hi>Furor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terinus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the matter offending be in all the Veins, or thoſe neer the Brain, there is a continual madneſs: but if it be ſhut up only in one part, the diſeaſe hath intermiſſion, and comes by fits.</p>
                     <p>The ſigns by which it is known, ſometimes ſhews the diſeaſe to be preſent, ſometimes that it is growing.</p>
                     <p>For the knowledg of Madneſs to come, firſt conſider the Natural diſpoſition of the Patient, which is chollerick, or melancholly. So in <hi>Hippocrates, 2. epid. 5. He who hath a Vein beating in his Arm, is like to be mad, and is ſubject to wrath; but he that hath it moving by degrees, is ſlow and ſtupid.</hi> Here <hi>Hippocrates</hi> calleth Arteries by the name of Veins. For he doth not mean a ſimple, but a violent Pulſation, unto which he oppoſeth that which is by degrees<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So that the meaning of his ſaying is this; They who have naturally a high ſtrong Pulſe, great and ſwift, are inclinable to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and fury; but they who have a ſlow pulſe, are dull and blockiſh.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, You muſt regard the Sex, for Men are more often mad than Women: Which is to be underſtood of the Original Diſeaſe of Madneſs; for Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>en are often mad by conſent from the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The Age is to be conſidered; for Madneſs comes oftener to yong men than to boyes and old men.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Mark the time of the year; It comes often in Spring, oftener in Summer, moſt often at the fall of the Leaf, according to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> Aphor. 20, 21, and 22. Sect. 3. In the Spring, the humors bred at other times, and kept al Winter quiet, are moved and ſtirred, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce proportionable diſeaſes: In the Summer, much choller, not only yellow, but black is encreaſed in them that are inclined to it, which cauſeth madneſs at that time; or elſe encreaſing till Autumn, the diſeaſe comes then.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Signs are more remote, and ſhew only in general a diſpoſition to this diſeaſe; but theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſhew it to be at hand. Conſtant pain in the head, watchings, ſhort and little ſleep, trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom dreams, cares, and thoughtfulneſs, frights from ſmal cauſes, a raſh and often fury from none, or the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But that the Mania is preſent you may know by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>igns mentioned in the Definition; namely, a Delirium without a Feaver, with fury and boldneſs; divers are the kinds of Dotage or Delirium in divers ſick men, and at divers times they come according as the cauſe is more or leſs vehement; for ſome have a raſh madneſs, and ſeize upon every man they meet, tear their own cloathes, ſomtimes lay violent hands to deſtroy themſelves. Others ate milder and tamer, and hurt no body, but ſpeak diſtractedly and ridiculouſly, ſomtimes they ſing, ſomtimes they laugh, and have divers whimſeys, and ſymptomes much like thoſe in Melancholly men and fools.</p>
                     <p>And from the variety of thoſe ſymptomes you may gather the variety of the cauſe: For immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate laughter, mirth, and ſinging, ſignifie that the matter offending is daſhed with much blood: but wrath, reſtleſsneſs, howling, ſtriking, pale and yellow color in the face, ſhew that choller is in fault: but a furious madneſs that laies hold on all it meets, and ſomtimes ſtayeth them, comes from choller burnt, which is called black choller; but if this black choller comes not of yellow choller, but melancholly aduſt, the Patient looks furiouſly, ſomtimes is long ſilent, and then breaks forth into earneſt diſcourſe; they are unruly and untoward, and ſomtimes cry and lament grievouſly.</p>
                     <p>The Prognoſtick of this Diſeaſe is,</p>
                     <p>A Mania is a ſtrong Diſeaſe, and continueth not only months, but years, even to death, eſpecially if it be haereditary. All Diſeaſes of black choller are hard to be cured, and this eſpecially, becauſe the Patient will not be ruled, and take their Medicines preſcribed.</p>
                     <p>A Mania which comes with laughter, and thoſe light ſymptoms is eaſier cured than that which comes with ſadneſs and fury.</p>
                     <p>That the Diſeaſe will ſhortly be cured, appears by Natural Evacuations, by ſweat, ſtool, bleeding at no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                     <p>Bloody-flux, Dropſie, Tertian Ague, or Quartan happening to a mad man, takes away his diſeaſe,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:49088:34"/>
for there is a remove of the humors unto the lower parts from the Head, in which they produce a new Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>For the Cure of this Diſeaſe, the matter offending is to be evacuated, revelled, and repelled, the hot Diſtemper is to be corrected, the Brain and other principal parts are to be ſtrengthened, which may be done by the means following.</p>

For <hi>Platerus</hi> affirms that innumer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able mad folks have been cured by Chyrurgions, and others who have ſtudied the Cure, and have let them blood twenty, or twenty ſix times; not only in the Arms, but Feet, Forehead, Noſtrils, Hemorrhoides, if the veins appear there; and alſo in the Hand, or <hi>Salvatella:</hi> This is to be done by degrees, intermitting Clyſters, and purging Medicines here preſcribed, Cupping Glaſſes to the Shoulders and Back with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>MElancholly</hi> is a Doting or <hi>Delirium</hi> without a Feaver with fear and ſadneſs.</p>
                     <p>It is diſtinguiſhed from a Phrenzy by want of Feaver; and from Madneſs, by Fear and Sadneſs, becauſe that comes with Fury and Boldneſs.</p>
                     <p>We ſay this Diſeaſe hath no Feaver: namely, of its own nature of it ſelf: but a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver may Accidentally be joyned with it: For nothing hindereth, but a continual or intermitting Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver may happen to one in this Diſeaſe; but this Feaver wil not be eſſentially in it, as in a Phrenzy, where a Feaver is eſſential to the Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>But we may doubt how Fear and Sadneſs may be ſaid to be of the eſſence of Melancholly: when we perceive that in many Melancholick people there is much laughter and appearance of joy. For ſome laugh, ſome ſing, ſome think themſelves to be very rich Kings and Monarchs. We Anſwer, That there are divers degrees of Melancholly, and divers mixtures of Melanchollick humors with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; from whence come varieties of Paſſions, ſo that they who have much blood or flegm mixed with Melancholly, may have joy and Cheerfulneſs: but that Diſeaſe is not at that time a true Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly, but is more like fooliſhneſs.</p>
                     <p>Alſo great variety of Doting ariſeth from the various diſpoſition of the Melanchollick humor: Hence it is that ſome think themſelves to be Kings, Princes, Prophets: Others, that they are made of Glaſs, or Potters-Clay; or that they are barely Corns ready to be devoured by the Hens<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Some think they are melting Wax, and dare not approach the Fire: Others, That they are Dogs,

Cats, Wolves, Cuckows, Nightingales, or Cocks, whoſe voyces they imitate. Others fancy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves dead, and will neither eat nor drink.

                     <p>The immediate Cauſe of Melancholly (that I may uſe the words of <hi>Galen</hi>) is a dark ſpirit or vapor very black; for when the Animal Spirits ought in their own Nature to be pure, thin, and tranſparant for the cheerful performing of the actions of the Brain, and to cauſe cheerfulneſs, if they change their conſtitution, and become dark and ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>The cauſe of this e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>il diſpoſition of the Spirits, is a Melanchollick humor, which being poſſeſſed with thickne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s, darkneſs, and blackneſs, doth infect the Spirits, and makes them cloudy and dark.</p>
                     <p>And this Melanchollick humor is cold and dry, and therefore proper for fixing and condenſing of the Spirits, which fixing and condenſing or thickening of the Spirits muſt needs cauſe ſorrow and heavineſs. For if the humor be thin and hot, as is black choller (from which comes madneſs) it doth rather produce fury and boldneſs than fear and ſorrow. Therfore the immediate cauſe of Melanchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is thickneſs and darkneſs of the Spirits Animal; but the neceſſary condition, and without which it cannot be, is a cold and dry diſtemper. But if any ſhal inſtance of an Hypochondriack Melanchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from <hi>Galens</hi> third Book <hi>de locis affect is,</hi> chap. 7. that it is an inflamation in the Hypochondria, and therefore the hot diſtemper doth prevail. We anſwer, That that Inflamation or burning of the Hypochondria, comes from the heat of blood long retained in the ſpleen and Meſeraick Veins by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of obſtructions, from whence many vapors are ſent up into the Brain, which though they be hot, yet are overcome by the coldneſs of the Brain, and are eaſily brought to a cold and dry temper which is proper to Melancholly. But if the heat of thoſe vapors be ſuch, that they ſpoil the temper of the Brain, and make it hot and dry, then comes Madneſs and not Melancholly. So that in Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Mania, and Melancholly, there is this difference; That in the firſt, namely, Mania, there is a hot and dry diſtemper; In the other, called Melancholly, a cold and dry diſtemper.</p>
                     <p>The former mentioned darkneſs of the Spirits confirmed by <hi>Galen,</hi> is rejected of <hi>Averroes,</hi> in this reſpect, Becauſe darkneſs brought upon the Animal Spirits, and the black color of a Melanchollick humor cannot infect the internal Sences; according to that vulgar Axiom, There is nothing in the Underſtanding which was not firſt in the Sence; therefore ſince that black color, or internal dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was not firſt repreſented to the eyes, it cannot be perceived by the internal Sences. We anſwer, That the blackneſs of a Melanchollick humor, or the darknes of the ſpirits doth not affect the internal Sences under the notion of color; but as they are ſomwhat beſides Nature in the brain hindering its a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. For the Animal Spirits for the perfect performance of the Actions of the brain, ought to be pure thin, and clear: But if (on the other ſide) they be impure, thick, and dark, they hinder the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the brain by infecting the ſpecies which are ſent thither, even as a colored glaſs doth repreſent the ſpecies of the object to the eye with its own Tincture.</p>
                     <p>A cold and dry diſtemper, which is propounded for a neceſſary condition to this diſeaſe of Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly, may be oppoſed by this Argument taken from <hi>Avicen</hi> in <hi>Fen. 1. Lib. 3. Tract.</hi> 4. Chap. 18. he ſaith, <hi>That Stammerers are for the moſt part Melanchollick.</hi> But theſe Stutterers are very moiſt in temper according to <hi>Galen,</hi> Comment. Aphor. 32. Sect. 6. where <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith, That Stammerers are moſt ſubject to looſneſs: And <hi>Galen</hi> thereupon ſaith, That Stammerers have the moiſteſt temper, as appears in children who are moſt ſubject to looſneſs. We anſwer, That <hi>Avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens</hi> Text is not to be underſtood of thoſe which are true Stammerers, which cannot pronounce the letter R. of which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> ſpake in the Aphoriſm aforeſaid, who are of a moiſter temper: But of thoſe which are called Trauly and Stutterers, which repeat the ſame ſyllable very often before they can pronounce a whol word: Which comes from their headlong phancy, when they ſtrive to ſpeak very quickly, for then the tongue foldeth its ſelf, and is conſtrained to ſtop and ſtay in the production of Words. And theſe Stutterers are of a melanchollick temper.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, It may be doubted, how darkneſs of the Spirits ſhould be an immediate cauſe of a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly Delirium, when every hurt action depends immediately upon ſome diſeaſe; but this tenebroſity or darkneſs can be referred to no kind of Diſeaſe. We anſwer, That tenebroſity or darkneſs, is a Diſeaſe in number, by reaſon that the coming thereof doth encreaſe the number of thoſe things which are neceſſary in the Brain for the performance of animal Functions. And the inſtance which may be brought againſt this Argument, namely, That a diſeaſe is an affect of a true part, is anſwered in the Treatiſe of <hi>Vertigo.</hi>

                        <pb n="50" facs="tcp:49088:36"/>The Proper ſigns of Melancholly, are propounded in the definition, namely, Fear, and Sorrow, without any manifeſt Cauſe, which are found in every kind of melancholly. But the ſeveral ſorts of melanchilly are known by their proper ſigns. So theſe following ſigns do ſhew that melancholly doth only<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> reſide in the head, namely, an evil habit of the Brain, or hot Diſeaſes going before, by which the blood contained in its Veins, is torrefied and burned, and at laſt brought into a melanchollick humor. Short and interrupted ſleep, troubleſom dreams, giddineſs, noiſe in the Ears, and no ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes from other parts, and eſpecially from the belly.</p>
                     <p>That this Diſeaſe cometh from the whol Body, appears by a melancholly habit of the whol body; either Natural, known by a black color, roughneſs, and leanneſs; or acquiſite, coming by cares, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, watchings, courſe diet, and the like.</p>
                     <p>That it comes from the Hypochondria, theſe ſigns declare; Heart-burning with no thirſt, often ſpitting, ſowr belchings, and windy, eruptions upwards and downwards, rumbling of the guts, pain and heavineſs of the midriff, perplexity, nauſeouſneſs, ſomtimes inſatiable appetite, heart-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, ſomtimes a ſwelling in the Hypochondria: And other ſigns which ſhall be ſhewn more at large in the Diſcourſe of Hypochondriack Melancholly.</p>
                     <p>That this Diſeaſe comes from the womb, may be known by thoſe which are ſet down in their order for the declaring of Hyſterical Diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>The Prognoſtick of this Diſeaſe is thus:</p>
                     <p>The Diſeaſe is dangerous, if Chronical, of long continuance, and very fixed: For a melanchollick humor, eſpecially that which comes by aduſtion, and inclineth to black choller, contemns the force of Medicines, if weak, and oppoſeth the ſtrongeſt: whence a melanchollick humor is ſaid to be the ſcourge and diſgrace of Phyſitians.</p>
                     <p>But a new ſprung melancholly coming of immediate Cauſes, is eaſily cured: For <hi>Galen</hi> reports in his third Pook, <hi>de loc. affect.</hi> chap. 7. That he hath often cured a melancholly in the beginning with only Baths of ſweet Waters.</p>
                     <p>The Hemorrhoids, or Piles coming upon melancholly men, ſomtimes bring cure, if the humors be caſt down thither critically by Nature: For ſomtimes they come ſymptomatically, and multiply the matter of the Diſeaſe in many parts.</p>
                     <p>Somtimes it is cured by flux of the Hemorrhoids, by Scabs, Itch, or other diſeaſes breaking forth of the Skin.</p>
                     <p>As to the Cure of it, from whenceſoever the Diſeaſe took its original, we muſt obſerve alwaies two things:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That the whol Body be freed from a melanchollick humor, and the filth of other humors; for it ſeldom happens that one part alone is troubled with it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That the main Cure be directed to the Hypochondria, becauſe that in the ſpleen and liver there is the firſt generation of Melancholly, and the gathering of it is in the parts thereabout; therefore the Cure of Hypochondriack Melancholly ſet down by us, will ſerve for the Cure of other diſeaſes of Melancholly: for you can ſcarce cure the Hypochondria from the abundance of any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, and the generation of any new, but by conſequence the whol body muſt be cured of the ſame. Therefore for all diſeaſes of Melancholly thoſe Remedies will ſuffice which are propounded in the Cure of Hypochondriack Melancholly.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Of a Catarrh, or Defluxion.</head>
                     <p>A Catarrh is a preternatural Defluxion of an Excrementitious humor, from the head into the inferior parts. It is therefore a Symptome of the third kind, namely, a fault in the Excrements.</p>
                     <p>The ſubſtance of the Brain being large, needs much nouriſhment; of whence comes neceſſarily abundance of Excrements, eſpecially by reaſon of the cold and moiſt diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the part: which excrements if they have only their moderate and natural quantity are received into the fore Ventricles of the Brain, and are ſent by the <hi>Choana,</hi> as by a funnel to the moiſt Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, and ſo are ſpit forth every day from the pallat; but if they grow more plentiful, and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in their Natural condition, they are diſperſed about the Brain and the <hi>Meninges,</hi> and ſo are ſent forth, not only by the pallat, but alſo by the noſtrils.</p>
                     <p>But when the Brain is affected with diſtemper and weakneſs, or is conſtrained to receive too much and diſproportionable nouriſhment, which it cannot ſufficiently concoct, there is a great encreaſe of excrements. Ad further (as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith) that the Brain like Cupping-glaſſes applied to the Body, never ceaſe to attract humors and vapors from the inferior parts; hence the excrements are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49088:36"/>
which by their quantity and quality provoking the expulſive, and overcoming the retentive faculty, run immoderately by unuſual and improper waies which they find out, to the great diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of the Body.</p>
                     <p>Since then a fluxion is the motion of matter from one part to another, we muſt conſider in that as in all motions, five things. The Terminus, or place from whence the place to which it moves; the Mover; the Moved; and the waies by which it is moved.

                     <p>In the place from which, or the part which ſendeth forth, we may obſerve two kinds of Cauſes: One is that which begetteth much moi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ure in the Body; the other is that which make the humors flow: That is called the generating, this the expelling Cauſe.</p>
                     <p>The generating Cauſes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> the hindering of Concoction, which comes either from the fault in the nouriſhment, or in the faculty.</p>
                     <p>The Concoction of the Brain is hindered chiefly from diſtemper, either cold or hot.</p>
                     <p>A cold diſtemper cauſeth that the Nouriſhment brought to the brain, is ill concocted and turned into flegm; as alſo that the vapors brought from the inferior parts, are not ſufficiently diſcuſſed, but are turned and condenſed into Water.</p>
                     <p>But a hot diſtemper doth attract more plentiful nouriſhment and vapors, ſo that Nature cannot ſufficiently diſcuſs them.</p>
                     <p>The Concoction of the brain is hindred through the Nouriſhment, either when there is too much, or when it hath evil qualities; ſo cold, groſs, and ſlimy meats and drinks immoderately taken, cannot be perfectly concocted, and make the Brain crude and moiſt. So ſharp and windy nouriſhment ſend many vapors to the head.</p>
                     <p>To theſe you may ad external Cauſes, which uſe to fill the head with ſuperfluous humidity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as Southernly Air, long ſleep, eſpecially at noon, an idle life, and the like.</p>
                     <p>Although the Brain be called the chief ſending part, yet it is not alwaies the chief cauſe of defluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but for the moſt part, the matter is ſent from other parts to the Brain: for after evil humors are collected, either in the Veins, or any peculiar part, as the Liver, Spleen, Meſentery, Womb, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly many Vapors are ſent from them to the head, but alſo the humors themſelves are carried to the head, and deſcend again to the inferior parts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the fault lieth moſt in the inferior parts in the breeding of a defluxion, whoſe diſtemper is divers, and the Obſtruction alſo divers.</p>
                     <p>For a hot diſtemper of the Bowels, makes abundance of vapors, from which comes defluxions, as in a Stil or Alembick: But a cold diſtemper by weak concoction begets crude humors, which upon the leaſt occaſion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ly to the brain.</p>
                     <p>But the Obſtructions of the parts of the lower belly, hinder the voiding of Excrements, whence it comes, that they being encreaſed by degrees, when they cannot find their free and ordinary courſe fly up to the brain. And to this doth alſo concur the weakneſs of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> brain, fit to receive theſe Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for (as we ſaid) the ſtronger parts to disburden themſelves upon the weaker, and it often happens that the brain by reaſon of its ſoft and looſe ſubſtance is weakeſt, and can leſs reſiſt than ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid and compact ſubſtances.</p>
                     <p>The impulſive cauſes are, too much heat of the brain, or coolneſs, or ſome concoction of humors: Too much heat doth extenuate and diffuſe the humors contained in the brain, and opens the pores by which they uſe to flow: ſuch is the heat of the head with the Sun or fire, or too much covering, ſmelling of hot Spices, and other paſſions.</p>
                     <p>Coldneſs doth compreſs the brain, and ſtrains forth the humors therein contained, as a Spunge is ſqueezed in the hand: Such change is often in Winter, and eſpecially in ſudden alteration of Air; as when a Southern wind hot and moiſt, is turned into a North wind cold and dry; or when one going out of a hot place, comes ſpeedily into a cold. To theſe Cauſes you may ad coldneſs of the feet, which by ſympathy is communicated to the Brain.</p>
                     <p>Many there are who deny the aforeſaid compreſſion of the brain by cold, becauſe cold doth incraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſat and condenſe the humors, and makes them leſs apt to flow; neither doth the example of a Spunge prove any thing, which will not empty its ſelf in the Air. But this Opinion delivered by <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> in <hi>lib. de loc. in homine,</hi> ſeems to be true; <hi>Fluxions</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>come of cold, when the fleſh and veins of the head, are extended: for thoſe when the head is cold and contracted, bound together, and excluding, do ſtrain forth moiſture. And alſo the fleſh doth aſſiſt them, and the hairs are on end, as being every where ſtrongly preſſed, and therefore whatſoever is ſtrained from thence, falls where it is occaſioned.</hi> From whence is manifeſt, That a Coarctation and compreſſion of the Parts may be made by cold, and from thence a humor may be expreſſed. Neither doth it hinder that denſation or thickening of humors which is made by cold, as was ſaid; for it may be ſo when the whol body is equally cold. But when the external parts are offended by ſudden cold, they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49088:37"/>
ſtraitened, and ſtrain the humor contained. Of leſs force is that Argument againſt the Spunge, that it is not expreſſed by the cold Air; for there is another Reaſon to be given of living parts, whoſe heat and ſpirits fly from the ſence of cold, and cauſe the parts wherin they are to be contracted; which cannot be in a Spunge ful of Water. Yet we muſt confeſs, that this is not the only way by which a Defluxion comes through cold; for cold of the feet will produce a Catarrh by communicating a cold diſtemper to the brain by the chiefeſt Nerves that come through the marrow of the back bone; and this coolneſs goes into the innermoſt parts of the brain, not the external, as cold air, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the head immediately: therefore we may rather think in this caſe, that the retentive faculty of the brain is weakened by cold of the head, ſo that it cannot contain the ſuperfluous humors which are many, but lets them flow forth.</p>
                     <p>There is alſo another way very uſual, by which a Catarrh of a cold cauſe cometh, namely, The ſtoppage of the external pores, eſpecially in the time wherein the body requireth moſt ſweat: Hence it comes that men very much inflamed, running ſuddenly into the cold air, are troubled with Catarrhs. So Catarrhs comes to be moſt frequent in Autumn, becauſe the Body being made thin, and the ports opened in the Summer, caſting forth many excrements by inſenſible tranſpiration, if they be preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſtopped by contraction of the body with cold, do cauſe humors and vapors to fly into the head, and center of the brain, So about the beginning of Autumn there are not only Catarrhs, but alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of watery humors are ſent forth by moſt men in their urine, and by ſtool, which cauſe fluxes of the Belly at that time. But if any ask why defluxions do not laſt al Winter when by reaſon of cold the pores are alwaies ſtopped? We anſwer, That Nature doth in Winter diſcharge her ſelf by other waies rather than by ſweat, namely, by ſtool, urine, and ſpittle. How great that Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is which is uſually by inſenſible tranſpiration or ſweat, is pleaſantly taught by <hi>Sanctorius</hi> in his Book <hi>de Statica Medicina,</hi> where he ſaith, That it is larger than all the ſenſible Evacuations put together: ſo that if the meat and drink of one day be eight pound in weight, the inſenſible tranſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be five pound: he is very curious in this matter. What light he hath left to the finding out of Cauſes, and Curing Diſeaſes, I leave to be judged by the Learned.</p>
                     <p>In the part receiving, you muſt conſider the imbecillity, or other diſpoſition to receive and attract defluxion. In regard of weakneſs, it is an uſual ſaying among Phyſitians, That the ſtronger parts do alwaies lay their ſuperfluous burden upon the weaker; as in Common-wealths, the Great Ones lay the chiefeſt burden upon the poor Commons.</p>
                     <p>Now the weakneſs of the parts is either Natural, or Adventitious. A Natural weakneſs comes from the ſoftneſs and looſneſs of the parts from the Glandles and Lungs, do eaſily entertain defluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: But an Adventitious weakneſs, is from a diſtemper, or from ſolution of continuity. A cold diſtemper by weakening the Native heat cauſeth the part to have leſs power to reſiſt the humor flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto it. And alſo a Solution of continuity or wound, makes the part more fit to receive defluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by its weakneſs; hence aroſe the uſe of Cauteries or Iſſues, becauſe the part being thereby wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened, the humors do flow from other parts unto it. And ſo the Lungs being ulcerated receive the humors from the head, and from al other parts.</p>
                     <p>Among other diſpoſitions for the attracting of a defluxion, heat is chiefly to be reckoned; for we may obſerve, that parts inflamed do plentifully attract humors. So in a Conſumption, many humors are drawn from the head to the lungs, not only by reaſon of the ulcer, but alſo by reaſon of the inflamation. Whence <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſpeaking of a Phthi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>There are two waies by which the humors are carried from the head into the inferior parts, either internal or external: The internal way is when the humor flows from the parts under the Skull, chiefly from the Ventricles of the Brain, and makes divers diſeaſes and ſymptomes according to the diverſity of the parts receiving, of which ſome have peculiar names, according to thoſe vulgar Verſes in <hi>Schola Salerni:</hi>

                        <item>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the Breaſt; upon the Jaws we call</item>
                        <item>It <hi>Branchus; Coryza</hi> through the Noſe doth fall.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>When the Humor flows upon the Breaſt, the Diſeaſe keeps the general name of a <hi>Catarrh,</hi> or Deflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion; when it falls upon the Jaws, and <hi>Aſpera Arteria,</hi> or rough Arteries, it is called <hi>Branchus, Raucedo,</hi> or Hoarſneſs; when it flows into the Noſtrils, it cauſeth not only a <hi>Coryza</hi> or Murrh, but <hi>Ozaena</hi> and <hi>Polypus.</hi> But in other parts it produceth various effects; if it fall upon the Nerves it produceth a Torpor or Numbneſs, a Palſey, Convulſion, Trembling: if in the Ears, Deafneſs, Swelling; if in the Eyes, Ophalmy, or Inflamation, Tears, Blindneſs; if upon the Uvula or Pallat, Swelling, Looſneſs or Laxity, or Ulcer; if in the Throat, the Squinzy; if on the Lungs, the Pleure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, Inflamation or Impoſthumation, Cough, ſhortneſs of Breath, ſpitting of Blood, Conſumption; if into the Stomach, Vomiting, want of Appetite; if into the Bowels, it cauſeth Diarrhaea, and Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentery:
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49088:37"/>
therefore it is rightly conceived that the greateſt part of Diſeaſes that trouble mans Body, have their original from the Head.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, Somtimes the humor flows from the Brain with the blood into the veins, whence comes the Diſeaſe called <hi>Febris Catarrhalis,</hi> when Nature is ſtrongly moved to expel the ſuperfluous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, and the Spirits being thereby much diſturbed, are inflamed, and cauſe a Quotidian Feaver: hence it is that a defluxion is reckoned among the cauſes of a Quotidian Feaver. And alwaies before the coming of the Joynt-gout or Inflamation called Eryſipelas, ſuch a Feaver doth proceed.</p>
                     <p>The external waies by which the humor flows from the head, are thoſe which are without the skul under the skin; and <hi>Fernelius</hi> ſuppoſed that the humors which chiefly carried between the fleſh and the skin, although by the continuity of the Muſcles, Membranes, and Nerves, as alſo the Veins and Arteries, the humors uſe to flow into the Eyes, Teeth, Jaws, Neck, Shoulders, Joynts, and other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal parts.</p>
                     <p>Some Authors make difference of Catarrhs, which are theſe: Some are called Ferini, or wild; ſome Suffocating; ſome Epidemical, or common.</p>
                     <p>A wild violent Catarrh is that which by its ſharpneſs ulcerateth the Lungs, and brings a Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and it comes of a ſharp and ſalt humor riſing from a hot Liver, and ſent into the brain, and from thence into the Lungs.</p>
                     <p>A Suffocating Catarrh, is when the humor flows violently into the hollow of the Lungs, and is ſtill renewed to the danger of ſtrangling.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, An Epidemical Catarrh hath a malign quality, and is common among the people, and comes from the corruption of the Air.</p>
                     <p>The Knowledg of this Diſeaſe, is from three ſigns: of the Subject, of the Diſeaſe, and of the Cauſe.</p>
                     <p>The Subject, or Body apt to fall into a Catarrh, is known by the ſlender Fabrick of it, eaſily pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with either hot or cold air; as alſo by the too compact Fabrick of it, which hindereth a free tranſpiration: as alſo a weak and cold brain, which cannot diſcuſs the vapors which are ſent unto it, or ſufficiently concoct its own nouriſhment: alſo a hot brain that attracts too many vapors: alſo the contrary actions of the Stomach and Liver, when one is hot and the other cold.</p>
                     <p>The Signs which ſhew the Diſeaſe, either declare it to be coming, or preſent.</p>
                     <p>The aforeſaid Cauſes ſhew it to be coming; but eſpecially, heavineſs in the head, dulneſs and numbneſs of the Sences, long ſleep, much ſnorting, a ſnotty noſe, and more ſpitting than uſual, coſtiveneſs of Body, and abundance of wind.</p>
                     <p>The ſigns of a Catarrh preſent are manifeſt, for either the humor flowing from the brain, is plainly ſeen, or the ſwellings and pains which it produceth in divers parts.</p>
                     <p>The ſigns of the Cauſes are alſo evident; for if a Catarrh come of a cold humor, there will be ſence of cold, paleneſs of face, ſweet ſpittle, ſowr belchings, ſlimy matter, or watery, and a general fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick habit of Body.</p>
                     <p>But that the humor diſtilling is hot, appears by redneſs of the face, thirſt, ſaltneſs and ſharpneſs in the mouth, inflamation, pain, and ulcers in the parts affected, and a chollerick habit of the whol Body.</p>
                     <p>An external Defluxion is known from an internal, in regard the pain is more external in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, eſpecially under the skin of the crown of the head, where ſomtimes you may perceive a ſoft tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor; often a painful combing back of the hair: and many times the humor is felt to fall down upon the outward parts with great pain, heat or cold.</p>
                     <p>The Prognoſtick of this Diſeaſe is elegantly laid down by <hi>Cornelius Celſus,</hi> in theſe words: <hi>If the humor flow from the head into the noſe, it is ſmal; if into the jaws, it is worſe; but if upon the Lungs it is worſt of all.</hi> But <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith, That a Catarrh is very hard to be concocted in thoſe that are very old.</p>
                     <p>Where there is a great plenty of humors, either from repletion, or from evil Concoction: there is a dangerous Catarrh, for it is to be feared leſt the humor flow ſuddenly, and cauſe Suffocation, or ſome other grievous accident.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of this Diſeaſe is two-fold; The one is of the Cold, the other of the Hot Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrh.</p>
                     <p>The whol Cure of a cold Catarrh conſiſts in the preparing and evacuating of the humor off ending, and in the revelling of it if it flow to the breaſt, or other part, and the ſtopping of its motion; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter let the diſtemper of the brain be amended.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then, If the matter be much, and flow very violently, and we fear leaſt it flow alſo from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts, eſpecially if the Liver be hot (for it is often ſeen, that men ſubject to Catarrhs, have a hot Liver, and a cold brain) we muſt breath a Vein; but if the matter be but little, and move gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the party be aged, and the temper of the Liver not hot, ſo that there is no ſuſpicion for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors to be ſent to the brain from any other parts, you may omit Phlebotomy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="54" facs="tcp:49088:38"/>The matter offending is firſt to be diminiſhed with a Potion or Pills, or other Purging Medicine, mentioned in the chapter of the cold diſtemper of the Brain.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards the remainder of the humor is to be prepared with an Apozeme, there alſo mentioned; or if you fear not to diſturb the humor too much, you may give a purging Apozeme, and at laſt make a compleat Evacuation with ſtronger Pills, or other Purges.</p>
                     <p>If the Catarrh be very ſtrong, you may give that which will powerfully root out the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>Coloquintida is very excellent for to purge the Brain ſtrongly; but it worketh very violently, and is offenſive with its bitterneſs: both which faults are corrected by ſteeping it in Urine; for ſo it laies aſide its bitterneſs, and becomes almoſt without taſt, and alſo is ſo gentle that it may be given to the quantity of a dram ſafely, and it is a moſt gallant Remedy for all cold Diſeaſes in the head.</p>
                     <p>It ſomtimes happens that Excrementitious Humors ſent from the parts beneath into the brain, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a Catarrh: and they find a preternatural courſe that way, by reaſon the natural courſe by which thoſe humors uſe to be evacuated is ſtopped; and then the Catarrh is beſt cured by opening thoſe waies with gentle, mild, and conſtant purging, that the humors flowing upwards, are ſo ſent downwards, and by degrees brought to their proper motion. And theſe gentle Purges may be made of Decoctions or Broths long continued; but in the mean while you muſt not neglect ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening Medicines.</p>
                     <p>For Revulſion, apply Cupping-glaſſes and Veſicatories, or things to cauſe bliſters, to the neck and ſhoulders, and make iſſues in the hinder part of the head and arms. <hi>Zacutus Luſitanus</hi> in <hi>lib. 2. Praxis admirandae, obſervat.</hi> 160. commends Iſſues behind the Ears for the beſt remedy againſt all diſtillations from the head: And we have ſeen good ſucceſs by them, eſpecially in defluxion upon the Eyes. You may uſe Errhines, Neeſings, Gargariſms, and Maſticatories; but with this Caution, That you uſe Errhines and Neeſings only when the Catarrh falls upon the Jaws, Lungs, and Stomach; but when it falls into the Eyes or Noſe, uſe Maſticatories and Gargariſms.</p>
                     <p>The forms of all theſe Medicines were ſet down in the Chapter aforegoing. But obſerve in the uſe of them, that when the matter is ſomwhat thin, you uſe not ſtrong diſcuſſients and diſſolvers, for by theſe you ſhall cauſe the humors to flow more violently upon the Breaſt, Lungs, or other parts; but you muſt mix ſome thickning things that may conſtrain the humor, as red Roſes, Maſtich, Corian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Nutmeg, and other things which we ſhall declare more at large in the hot Catarrh. You may make an Errhine for this purpoſe as followeth:</p>
                     <p>Take of <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <hi>Marjoram Water four ounces: the Juyce of Bettony one ounce: Nigella or Gith ſeeds poudered, half a dram: Nutmeg one ſcruple. For rich people you may ad two grains of Musk and Amber-greece.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Lignum vitae one ounce: Spring Water one pint: Infuſe it all night upon warm embers; then boyl it to the conſumption of half, adding in the concluſion, ſweet Marjoram, and red Roſe leaves, of each two pugils.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So when the matter is but thin, you may make a Maſticatory, either of Maſtich alone, or after this manner:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Nutmeg one dram: Maſtich, and Gum Arabick, of each half a dram: Pouder them, with Roſe water make Troches to chew.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The beſt Neeſing is made of black Hellebore, and Sugar, equal parts.</p>
                     <p>The Extract of Tobacco made in <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> and held under the tongue in the bigneſs of a Peaſe, brings forth abundance of Water; but if you take too much, or ſwallow it down, it will cauſe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent vomiting. We have ſhewed that Cauteries to the Arms, hinder part of the Head, and behind the Ears, are very good, as alſo to the nape of the Neck, and Shoulders, which are now adaies in great requeſt. But there is a new place found out by ſome, namely, in the Neck, neer the Jugular veins, between the Muſcles: And by this means two men have been cured of old Catarrhs which cauſed hoarſneſs.</p>
                     <p>Finally, After convenient Evacuations, things that ſtrengthen the Brain and dry it, are to be uſed both internally and externally, as Opiates, Pouders, Bags, Fumes,, deſcribed in the Cure of the cold diſtemper of the Head. But you muſt remember to put unto them ſome Conſerve of Roſes, Nutmeg, or white Frankinſence, when you cure a Catarrh.</p>
                     <p>The Decoction of Maſtich Wood uſed as a Sudorifick, dries the Brain, and ſtops Defluxions. For which, the following things are good.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Coriander ſeed prepared half an ounce; Nutmeg and Frankinſence, of each three drams; Liquoris and Maſtich, of each two drams; Cubebs one dram; Conſerve of red Roſes one ounce; white Sugar diſſolved in Roſe water ten ounces: Make a Confection in little rolls, weighing three drams. Let him take one morning and evening.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe following Troches are much commended by <hi>Solenander,</hi> Conſ. 10. Sect. 4. which he bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49088:38"/>
which he borrowed from both the Ancient Greeks and Arabians.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the beſt Frankinſence and Juyce of Liquoris, of each one dram: Opium, Saffron, and Mirrh, of each one ſcruple: With Syrup of Poppies make Troches, or Pills to be taken now and then, two ſcruples, or half a dram at a time.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe Tablets following are very good:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Diambra, and Diamoſchi dulcis, of each one dram: white Amber one ſcruple: Oyl of Annis ſeeds, three drops: Sugar diſſolved in Lavender Water, four ounces: Make Tablets of two drams in weight; take one morning and evening.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Balſom for the Head preſcribed in the Chapter for the cold diſtemper, after the Opiate is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent taken inwardly, and into the noſtrils.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lac Sulphuris,</hi> and the flower of Brimſtone are commended by Chymiſts for the Cure of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrh: and the Galeniſts uſe it much in Tablets.</p>
                     <p>In a new Catarrh, Water of Nuts, with Hydromel, given three nights together doth much hinder it.</p>
                     <p>Shave the fore part of the head, and apply a Cataplaſm, of two ounces of Leaven, and two drams of Amber: But if the Patient will not permit his head to be ſhaved, let it be cut, and lay a bag of Chamepits or Groundpine, mixt with Amber.</p>
                     <p>Beſides the afore mentioned Fumes, one made of Tacamahaca is excellent; for it dries a Catarrh, and hinders his Motion; neither is the ſcent too ſtrong, but the Patient may ſhut it into his chamber without offence.</p>
                     <p>It is profitable to dry the Head with bags of Bran, Gromwel, and Salt, Leaves of Sage, Bettony, French Lavender, Annis ſeeds, Fennel ſeeds, and the like.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, If the Diſeaſe be ſtubborn, all thoſe Medicines which are mentioned in the cold diſtemper of the head, are to be uſed.</p>
                     <p>A hot Catarrh is Cured by Medicines which diſcharge the matter offending, and which do thicken it, and revel it; as alſo by correcting the diſtemper of the parts, ſending and receiving it.</p>
                     <p>For this end, firſt let blood, if nothing hinder, by which the humor flowing is revelled, and the ſharpneſs abated.</p>
                     <p>Then carry away part of the humor by a gentle Purge, which may no waies ſtir violently the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, as followeth:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the beſt Rhubarb, four ſcruples: Citrine Myrobalans rubbed with the Oyl of ſweet Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, half a dram: yellow Sanders half a ſcruple: Infuſe them in Lettice and Purſlain Water, and ſtrain it, adding of Manna and Syrup of Roſes Solutive, of each one ounce: Make a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or inſtead of the Waters afore mentioned, you may make a Decoction of cold Herbs, and Tama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinds; to which you may put your Purgatives.</p>
                     <p>Then you muſt alter and thicken the humor with convenient Juleps.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Lettice, Purſlain, and Plantane, of each one handful: the four great cold Seeds, white Poppy ſeeds, of each two drams: Violets, Water-lillies, and red Poppies, of each one pugil; boyl them to a pint: Diſſolve in the ſtraining, the Syrup of Violets and dried Roſes, of each one ounce and an half. Make a Julep for three draughts, to be taken twice in a day.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or inſtead of this Decoction, uſe the diſtilled Waters of thoſe Herbs, or Emulſions of the four great cold Seeds.</p>
                     <p>After uſe a little ſtronger Purge, putting to the former, Senna, or Catholicon, or Diaprunes, or the like.</p>
                     <p>A light ſweet Medicine, thickening and ſweetening the humor, is made of the Yolks of two new laid Egs, diſſolved in five or ſix ounces of ſpring Water with one ounce of Sugar; heat them well, and ſtir them upon the fire, and take it as hot as you can morning and evening for three daies toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>And at laſt you muſt labor for a ſtronger reſtraning of the flux, and thickning of the humor with this Syrup.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Syrup of Violets and dried Roſes, of each one ounce: Syrup of Poppies half an ounce: Give an ounce at a time in a ſpoon at Bed time.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The following Opiate is good for the ſame purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>old Conſerve of Roſes ſix drams: the ſpecies of Diatragaganth frigid. two drams: Bole-armenick waſht in Roſe water, two ſcruples: With the Syrup of dried Roſes make an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate. Take the quantity of a ſmal nut at night<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Barley Cream is very profitable.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>clenſed Barley as much as is ſufficient, ſteep it ſix hours, and then boyl it well, and ſtrain it; then take three ounces of blanched ſweet Almonds; Pompion ſeeds husked, one ounce and an half; Melone ſeeds one ounce; white Poppy and Lettice, of each half an ounce: Beat them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49088:39"/>
and with Barley Water take out the Milk, which with two pound of the Pulp of Barley boyl a little and mix it with Sugar: Let him drink ten ounces at a time, ſome mornings in his bed, and ſleep after it, and ſomtimes in the evening.</hi> Hold the Troches in the mouth.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Gum Traganth, and Arabick, of each two drams: Bole-armenick, and Terra Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gillata waſhed in Roſe water, of each one dram: white Poppy ſeeds, and juyce of Liquoris, of each half a dram: Sugar Penids one ounce: With the Mucilage of Quince ſeeds, extracted with Roſe water, make little Cakes to be held in the mouth day and night.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Spirit of Sulphur and Vitriol, three or four drops given morning and evening in convenient Liquor, hath great force againſt all Catarrhs, eſpecially againſt thoſe which come from Inflamation of the Bowels: It may be given in drink in a ſmaller quantity, for it goes with the drink through all the veins, and hinders the motion of the humors.</p>
                     <p>The Cryſtal Mineral is for the ſame uſe given with Juleps and other Medicines.</p>
                     <p>When theſe do not avail, we muſt be conſtrained to uſe Narcoticks or Stupefactives: Among which Laudanum is the beſt, given to four or five grains at bed time; or one ounce or half an ounce of Syrup of Poppies: Theſe do wonders being uſed in the beginning of the Diſeaſe. New Treacle given at night from a ſcruple to half a dram, hath the ſame force.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Benedictus Faventius</hi> uſeth the following Pills in a Salt Catarrh with good ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Juyce of Liquoris two drams: waſh'd Aloes one dram:</hi> Filulae de Cynogloſſo, <hi>half a dram: With Syrup of Violets make a Maſs, of which take a ſcruple at bed time.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Troches of <hi>Solenander</hi> before mentioned, are excellent.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Diacodium album</hi> preſcribed in the Cure of the Phrenzy is good for this.</p>
                     <p>In the mean while the matter flowing muſt be revelled by Clyſters, Cupping Glaſſes, Frictions, and binding of the external parts, and chiefly by Veſicatories in the Neck, and finally with Iſſues in the hinder part of the Head and Arms, if the Catarrh be old.</p>
                     <p>But for the ſtrengthening of the Head, and ſtopping of the fluxion, and conſuming the remainder; Pouders, Bags, and Emplaſters, are good.</p>

                     <p>Take of <hi>Maſtick and Frankinſence, of each half a dram: Sandrach, red Coral, red Roſes, Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, Pomegranate flowers and Peels, of each one dram: Labdanum two drams: Wax and Oyl of Roſes, as much as is ſufficient. Make an Emplaſter for the Coronal Suture.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But becauſe this Catarrh for the moſt part comes from a hot diſtemper of the Liver, therefore you muſt uſe Medicines to that.</p>
                     <p>Finally, This is moſt remarkable, which is alſo mentioned in the Cure of a cold Catarrh; That Excrements uſe to cauſe Catarrhs by flowing to the Head when their uſual natural paſſages are ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped: And then a Catarrh is beſt cured by opening thoſe paſſages with a gentle and conſtant purging in Broths, or the like.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XVI.</hi> Of the Head-ach.</head>
                     <p>THe word <hi>Cephalalgia</hi> is uſed generally for every pain of the Head: but more eſpecially it ſignifieth a new Head-ach: But the word <hi>Cephalaea</hi> ſignifieth an old Head-ach; and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micranea</hi> ſignifieth that pain which only is in one ſide of the Head.</p>
                     <p>There are other differences of Head-aches: they are divided into Internal, and External; Pains by conſent, and by propriety: and of theſe, one is called a pricking pain; another a ſtretching, or extending pain; another a heavy; another a beating or ſhooting pain.</p>
                     <p>The internal pain of the head is in the Meninges or Membranes, that is very deep, and reacheth to the roots of the Eyes: But an external pain is in the Pericranium or Membrane without the Skull, and will not endure the roots of the hairs to be combed back, and is made greater by the leaſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Head. This is the Doctrine of <hi>Galen,</hi> which he teacheth 3. <hi>de loc. aff. cap.</hi> 1. and <hi>lib. 2. de comp. med. ſecundum loc. cap.</hi> 3. ſaying very ſolidly, That the internal Head-ach is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the external by this peculiar ſign, That in the internal the pain comes to the roots of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49088:39"/>
the eyes, not in an external, and he gives this Reaſon, Becauſe the coats of the Eyes come from the <hi>Meninges</hi> of the Brain, whence it comes that the grief is conveighed to the Eyes. But <hi>Fernelius</hi> contradicts this Doctrine, <hi>lib. 5. Pathalogiae cap.</hi> 1. and affirmeth, that external pains do reach to the roots of the Eyes, becauſe the <hi>Pericranium</hi> or Skin of the Skul wherein thoſe pains are, doth reach to the cavity of the Eyes: to whom <hi>Rondoletius</hi> anſwers, <hi>lib. 1. meth. med. cap.</hi> 5. that the Cavity of the Eye doth not ſuffer with the Pericranium, although it reach to it, by reaſon that the pain of the Pericranium comes for the moſt part of external cold; for a cold part will eaſily ſuffer from the like quality. But that cold cannot reach to the hollow of the Eye, becauſe it is preſerved by the heat, blood, and ſpirits of the Eyes; but if at any time a headach cometh of external heat, or the like, the Skin of the head is only affected, not the Pericranium which lieth deep. But this Doctrine of <hi>Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deletius</hi> doth not altogether take away all difficulty; for although all things which he alledgeth ſhould be granted, yet if a pain ariſe from a tumor gathered upon the Pericranium, or of ſome other cauſe that diſſolveth continuity, and divideth, there is no reaſon why the grief ſhould not reach to the hollow of the Eye. We can ſay this in defence of <hi>Galen,</hi> that this ſign was given by him for two Reaſons: Firſt, Becauſe the Membrane which reacheth to the hollow of the Eye from the Pericrani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, is not ſo ſenſible, and therefore cannot ſuffer but obtuſely: but the coats of the Eyes which come from the <hi>Meninges</hi> are very ſenſible, and therefore have great pain: Moreover, that Membrane which cometh from the Pericranium doth not touch the Eye ſo inwardly and deeply towards the optick Nerves, as the coats which come from the <hi>Meninges,</hi> whence it is that the external pain cannot extend it ſelf to the roots of the Eyes as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith.</p>
                     <p>A pain by propriety is conſtant and permanent, nor doth it follow the diſeaſe of other parts: But a pain by conſent or ſympathy, depends upon the infirmity of another part, ſo that as that encreaſeth or diminiſheth, the Headach encreaſeth or diminiſheth. Now this pain by ſympathy, is either by conſent from the whol Body, as in Feavers; or from ſome peculiar part as the Stomach, Liver, Spleen, or Mother.</p>
                     <p>But we may know what part is affected when a pain is communicated to the head by its proper ſigns.</p>
                     <p>A pricking pain comes from a ſharp chollerick humor or vapor which toucheth the Membranes of the Brain. A heavy pain comes from much thick, and cold matter, namely, flegm or melancholly compreſſing the ſenſible parts. An extending pain comes from wind or mild humors which work themſelves into the Membranes and diſtend them. A beating or pulſative pain, comes of thin cholle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick blood or ſpirits abounding, by which the Arteries being ſtretched and ſwoln, do beat more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently, and ſhake the Membranes, and ſo ſtriking the adjoyning parts, cauſe in them a ſence of Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, as <hi>Galen</hi> teacheth more at large, 2. <hi>de loc. aff. c.</hi> 3.</p>
                     <p>From what is ſaid, the chief cauſes of a Headach are ſufficiently declared, which in general are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the ſolution of continuity, as to the immediate cauſe: For whatſoever doth bring a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt or hidden ſolution of continuity, is like to bring a headach.</p>
                     <p>The ſigns of the kinds of Head-ach, and of the cauſes that produce them, may be learned from what is ſaid, and therefore we come to the Prognoſticks.</p>
                     <p>An external headach is alwaies leſs dangerous and eaſier cured than an internal.</p>
                     <p>A Headach in a ſharp Feaver with thin and white urine is dangerous, for it ſignifies the chollerick matter is ſent into the Brain, whence there is fear of a Phrenzy.</p>
                     <p>A ſtrong pain of the Head ſuddenly ſeizing without evacuation following, or mitigation of the diſeaſe, is deadly: for it ſignifies the deſtruction of the animal faculty, which no more feeleth that object which cauſed the grief.</p>
                     <p>In a great Headach it is evil to have the outward parts cold; for by the vehemency of the pain there is a ſtrong attraction of heat to the part affected, which wil cauſe inflamation.</p>
                     <p>They that recover of a diſeaſe in the inferior parts, and have after a vehement Headach, if a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt evacuation went not before, will have an impoſthume in their Brain, for it ſignifies a tranſlation of the matter which cauſed the diſeaſe into the Brain.</p>
                     <p>They who vomit green in a headach, and are deaf being awake, are ſuddenly very mad, 1. <hi>Porrh.</hi> for it ſignifieth a collection of choller into the Brain, which maketh the Stomach conſent therewith and ſuffer.</p>
                     <p>Headach and noiſe in the Ears without a Feaver, or a giddineſs, or deafneſs, or numbneſs of the hands, ſignifieth an Apoplexy or Epilepſie to be at hand, <hi>Hipp.</hi> in <hi>Coacis:</hi> For thoſe ſymptomes come from abundance of thick flegm in the Brain.</p>
                     <p>To women with child ſleepy and heavy headaches are evil, 1. <hi>Porrh.</hi> for they ſignifie the flux of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors to the head, which when they are many in women with child by reaſon they have not their cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, do threaten danger.</p>
                     <p>A Headach which was not from the beginning of the Diſeaſe, but roſe from the diſturbance of the body, ſhews that there will be a criſis by bleeding at the noſe, or by vomit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="58" facs="tcp:49088:40"/>Since then the pain of the head cometh either of a cold or hot cauſe, we muſt direct the Cure for the taking away of both.</p>
                     <p>For the Cure of a cold Head-ach the flegmy matter is firſt to be evacuated being prepared, as is ſhewed in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>hapter afore going. Then we muſt correct the cold diſtemper of the Brain, and the reliques of the humor are to be diſcuſſed with Bags, mentioned in the former Chapter, or in the Chapter of the cold diſtemper of the Brain: With which being warmed, let the head, being ſhaven, be rubbed for an hour and an half every morning till the cauſe of the pain be ſpent and exhauſted.</p>
                     <p>After the head is well rubbed, ſprinkle upon it this following Pouder, having upon it Cotton or Wool.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Nutmegs, Cloves, Pepper, Pellitory, of each half an ounce: the Leaves of Sage, Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries, of each two drams: Muſtard ſeed, and Water-creſs ſeeds bruiſed, of each ſix drams: Make a pouder of theſe, ſprinkle it upon the Head as aforeſaid; and comb it in the morning before the uſe of the little Bags, that the pouder laid on the day before may be taken off.</hi>

                        </gap>itable, Neeſings, and Apophlegmatiſms or things to chew, which were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed formerly.</p>
                     <p>A Magiſtral Syrup alſo made as followeth is very profitable.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Guajacum wood, and Roots of</hi> China <hi>ſliced, of each one ounce and an half: Infuſe them twelve hours in four pints of ſpring Water: Boyl them till half be conſumed, adding in the end, the Leaves of Vervain one handful; the flowers of French Lavender and Marjoram, of each a ſmal handful: diſſolve in it being ſtrained half a pound of white Sugar. Boyl it up to a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup; but before it be perfectly boyled caſt in two ounces of Senna tyed in a clout; the beſt Agrick two ounces; Rhubarb three ounces: let him take two or three ounces, once a week.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe Pills alſo following are very good which in times paſt were of great eſteem in <hi>Italy</hi> in the daies of <hi>Euſtachius Rudius</hi> chief Profeſſor in the Univerſity of <hi>Padua,</hi> who was reported to be the Inventor of them, and accounted them a great Secret; and therefore gave them to one Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry only to be made by him, leſt others ſhould know the Receipt which indeed he borrowed out of <hi>Wickerus,</hi> who propoundeth it from <hi>Andernacus:</hi> and it is thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Coloquintida ſix drams: Agarick trochiſcated, Diagridium, black Hellebore, and Turbith, of each half an ounce: Aloes one ounce:</hi> Diarrhodon Abbatis <hi>half an ounce: Let the purging things be bruiſed and beaten together, and put in a glaſs with the ſpirit of Wine, ſo much as is ſufficient, and let them be digeſted for eight daies in a warm place, and then ad the pouder of Diar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhodon, and infuſe them four daies longer, then ſtrain them and preſs them, and let the Liquor ſo preſſed forth be diſtilled in</hi> Balneo, <hi>ſo long till the extract in the bottom of the Alembick grow ſo thick that it may make Pills, the doſe whereof is one ſcruple.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the following Pills are aſcribed to <hi>Fernelius,</hi> of which he affirmed he found by experience ſuch excellency, that he never met with a <hi>Cephalalgia,</hi> or <hi>Hemicrania,</hi> that is, half Headach, but he cured it.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the beſt Aloes half an ounce: the Pouder of the Electuary of Pearls, the three Sanders, and red Roſes, of each three grains: With Syrup of Wormwood, and Violets, make a Maſs. Give a dram thereof twice in a week one hour or two before Supper.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And finally, in a ſtubborn pain that is old, all thoſe Medicines are convenient, which were before mentioned in the Cure of the cold diſtemper of the Brain; among which, Epiſpaſticks, or bliſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing Plaiſters are not the meaneſt. Which alſo not prevailing ſome are ſo bold as to apply <hi>Vigo's</hi> Emplaiſter with Mercury, which they ſay hath cured old headaches ſomtimes, by cauſing them to ſpit much.</p>
                     <p>Baths of Brimſtone and Bitumen are very efficacious in this caſe, uſed both to the Head, and the whol Body.</p>
                     <p>Alſo in an old Headach, ſweating Decoctions are very good, and famous Authors declare that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have been cured thereby,</p>
                     <p>Which not prevailing, <hi>Mercatus</hi> is bold to fly to the uſe of Stibium, and commends it highly in his firſt Book of the Cure of internal Diſeaſes, and the eighth Chapter. But in an old grief, it is better to ſtrengthen the head often, than to uſe too many Evacuations: Therefore Pouders and Caps, and other topick or external Medicines are very neceſſary before mentioned in the Cure of the cold Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper of the Brain.</p>
                     <p>But Pouders are more commendible, becauſe the vertue of a Cap is not ſo much communicated to the Brain, and the pain may be encreaſed by the filth which is contracted by the long wearing of them.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, An Oyntment may be applied of the Oyl of Almonds, in which wild Bettony, Bay leaves, Maſtich, Lavender, Mints, Marjoram, Thyme, Penyroyal, Nutmeg, Cloves, and Cinnamon, or ſome of theſe have been boyled, adding in the time of the boyling a little red Wine.</p>
                     <p>Or this following Chymical Oyl.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="59" facs="tcp:49088:40"/>Take of <hi>Turpentine one pound: Maſtich, Nutmeg, Cinnamon, of each one dram: Cloves, Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doary, Galangal, Ladanum, of each one ounce and an half: the juyce of Ebulus or Dwarf-Elder, and of the wild Cowcumber, of each one dram: the Oyl of Chamomel and Lillies, of each half a pint: red Wine one pint and an half: wild Marjoram green one handful: Pouder thoſe that are to be poudered, and put them into a Glaſs Retort, and extract an Oyl; with which anoint the head after it is ſhaved.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Oyl of Amber is very good, and it will be ſufficient only to anoint the Head therewith.</p>
                     <p>While you uſe the afore mentioned Remedies, you may alſo uſe from the beginning of the Cure ſpecifical Medicines, ſuch as this Epitheme.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the pouder of Zedoary one dram: the Water of Bettony, Vervain, and Elder, of each one ounce: Mix them and apply them hot to the part grieved with Scarlet cloth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Among the proper Medicines for the Head-ach, from what cauſe ſoever it ariſeth, Vervain is the chief; whoſe Water diſtilled, you may both apply externally, and give of it internally to the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of ounces, with three drops of the ſpirit of Salt. Green Vervain alone only hung about the Neck, hath cured two Pat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="4 letters">

                        </gap>s when many other Medicines failed, as <hi>Foreſtus</hi> reports.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Zacutus Lucitanus</hi> it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>. 1. <hi>Praxis Med. mirab. obſervat. 7. 8. 9. &amp;</hi> 10. propounds four Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, confirmed by Experience; namely, An Iſſue in the back of the hand, Horſ-leeches to the Temples, opening of the Vein in the Forehead and the corner of the Eye, which you may read in the place cited.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things are to be noted concerning thoſe Obſervations:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ſue between the Thumb and fore Finger is approved by other Experiments, and hath cured great Headaches.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, In the Cure by Horſ-leeches, <hi>Zacutus</hi> is not content to apply two or three as ordinarily is done, but ten or twelve round about the Temples; whence comes a great attraction of Blood, which may draw forth the whol matter of the Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, In the Curing by opening the Veins in the Forehead, we muſt obſerve, That that Vein was twice opened, whence it appears that the firſt was not ſufficient; when ordinarily our Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners do ſeldom open it the ſecond time, if the firſt hath been to little benefit.</p>
                     <p>The hot Cauſe of a Primary and Eſſential Headach, is Blood or Choller. And the like Remedies are proper for both, though they muſt be made ſtronger or weaker according to the ſtrength of the Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then (after a Clyſter is adminiſtred) begin with Blood-letting, drawing forth more when the grief proceeds of blood, than when it proceeds of choller.</p>
                     <p>Then give a Medicine to purge Choller, not only when Choller is the Principal Cauſe, but when blood aboundeth whoſe thinner part is eaſily turned into Choller.</p>
                     <p>If the matter offending is not ſufficiently taken away by one purge, you muſt purge again at a due diſtance.</p>
                     <p>After apply Repelling Medicines to the Head, and Vinegar of Roſes, ſuch as were propounded in the Cure of the Phrenzy, making choice of the mildeſt.</p>
                     <p>And after it will be very profitable to apply Creatures newly killed, or parts of them, to diſcuſs the reliques of the Diſeaſe, and to aſſwage the pain.</p>
                     <p>In an Headach which goeth with a continual Feaver, a Sheeps Lungs applied hot do much aſſwage the pain.</p>
                     <p>Alſo a Cataplaſm of bruiſed Guords, and Houſleek to the feet.</p>
                     <p>The opening of the Saphena after ſufficient bleeding in the Arm, cures often times a Headach with a Feaver very ſuddenly.</p>
                     <p>You muſt uſe Cupping-glaſſes with, and without Scarification and Frictions of the extream Parts.</p>
                     <p>And in the whol time of the Diſeaſe, if the Belly be not looſe, you muſt every day give an Emolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and cooling Clyſter, and which do gently purge.</p>
                     <p>After general Evacuations and Revulſions, you may rightly, and with profit derive the matter by opening the Head Vein, or with Horſ-Leeches to the Forehead, or with Veſicatories to the Neck.</p>
                     <p>In the mean while let the whol maſs of Humors be qualified with Juleps, Emulſions, and Broths, as was mentioned in the Cure of the Phrenzy.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, If the pain be very violent you muſt apply Narcoticks both externally and internally, as they are ſet down in the ſaid Cure of the Phrenzy.</p>
                     <p>Here alſo may avail the opening of the Forehead Veins, and Leeches to the Temples, commended from <hi>Zacutus Luſitanus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Paraeus lib. 16. cap.</hi> 4. reports that a deſperate half Headach was cured by opening the Arteries
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49088:41"/>
in the Temples, and ſaies there is no danger in doing it. The Artery is opened as a Vein, and ſix ounces of blood forcibly leaping forth are to be taken: After apply a convenient Ligature, and open it not in four daies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Botallus</hi> alſo ſaies, That it doth miraculouſly cure old Head-aches; and we alſo have cured deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ones the ſame way, and never found any danger in the opening of the Artery.</p>
                     <p>You muſt apply a Plaiſter to the Orifice, of Frankinſence, Maſtich, Bole armenick, and Hares Hair, with the white of an Eg, and then make your Ligature as you uſe to do in Wounds of the Head.</p>
                     <p>In all pains of the Head, of what cauſe ſoever, if other means fail, and the greatneſs of the pain, make thee run to extremities; a Veſicatory applied over all the Head, after it is ſhaven, will cure it.</p>
                     <p>A Cautery upon the Coronal Suture ſomtimes hath perfectly cured a violent Head-ach.</p>
                     <p>But it is more powerful if it be applied to the Temples, of which ſee <hi>Poterius, obſervat. centur. 3. cap.</hi> 8. and our Obſervations thereon.</p>

The ſight is hurt when it is diminiſhed, aboliſhed, or depraved. Sight aboliſhed is called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> in Greek: in Latine <hi>Caecitas.</hi> But ſight dimiſhed hath divers Names according to the degree and manner of the diminution: of which the chief are <hi>Amblyopia, Myopia, Nyctalopia,</hi> and <hi>Acies Veſpertina.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Caecitas</hi> blindneſs, comes either from an abſotute Obſtruction of the Optick Nerves (and then it is called <hi>Amauroſis</hi>) or from a total Suffuſion, or from ſome great fault in the Tunicles and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Amblyopia,</hi> in Latin <hi>Obſcuritas, Hebetudo,</hi> or <hi>Caligo,</hi> dark or dim ſight, when the Object is not cleerly ſeen at what diſtance ſoever placed; comes from the ſame Cauſes, but more light and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, as an imperfect Obſtruction of the Optick Nerves, a light ſuffuſion, want of spirits or groſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſame, and the like.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Myopia,</hi> in Latin <hi>Luſcioſitas,</hi> or Pur-blindneſs in which the Objects are not perceived, except they be very nigh, and cloſe to the Eyes, but not at all a far off, or very little; and imperfectly: ſo that they perceive not their known Friends paſſing by: And according to the Opinion of <hi>Galen,</hi> and all Modern Phyſitians, from the thinneſs and ſmalneſs of the viſour ſpirits which ſtand not in need of a <hi>medium,</hi> much enlightned to make a perfect ſight, but is thereby diſſipated. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they which have groſs and thick ſpirits, ſee things beſt at a diſtance, becauſe that groſs ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits needs more enlightning which is brought by the larger illumination of the <hi>medium:</hi> But this Doctrine is demonſtrated to be falſe, and to spring from ignorance in Opticks whoſe Principles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that theſe diverſities of ſight proceed from the diverſity of the ſcituation of the Cryſtalline hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor. For when the ſpecies of the Objects are received into the Cryſtalline humor by a Pyramis or ſharp Point thereof called <hi>Conus;</hi> if the Cryſtalline humor be too much inward towards the pupil
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49088:42"/>
of the Eye, the remote Objects are better ſeen, becauſe it is neceſſary that the Objects ſhould be at a farther diſtance, that the <hi>Conus,</hi> or point of the Pyramis may come to the Cryſtalline bumor, and there be terminated: But if the Objects come neerer the Eye, the <hi>Conus</hi> goeth by the Cryſtalline, and they are ſeen more obſcurely: Again, If the Cryſtalline lie too low and too far from the Tunicle called <hi>Uuea,</hi> the Objects muſt be neerer to the Eyes, that the <hi>Conus</hi> or point of the Pyramid may come to it: whence it appears that <hi>Myopia</hi> comes no other wayes then from the Cryſtall me lying too low; and ſo this Diſeaſe becometh connatural, and not to be cured. But the affect of <hi>Myopia</hi> is contrary in which the Object is better ſeen at a diſtance; and this happens for the moſt part in Old Men, in whom ſome of the portion of the watery Hamor is ſpent, ſo that the Cryſtalline goes to the Pupil of the Eye: Farther, By long holding down of the Head either with Reading, Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or otherwiſe, the Cryſtalline Humor comes by degrees forward: This is demonſtrated by the uſe of Spectacles; becauſe that they who have <hi>Myopia,</hi> or are Pur-blind, ſee beſt with hollow or concave ſpectacles, by which the rayes or beams of the viſible ſpecies are diſperſed, whereby it comes to paſs, that the <hi>Conus</hi> of the Pyramis is more long, and ſo that thing which by reaſon of the great diſtance could not be ſeen, is now plainly perceived; becauſe the <hi>Conus</hi> of the Pyramis is extended as far as the Cryſtalline, which before ended in the Pupilla, or in the watery Humor, or in the white Humor: On the contrary, Old Men are helped with Convex Spectacles, by which the beams are united, and the <hi>Conus</hi> of the Pyramis is made ſhorter, and ſo things are better perceived whoſe <hi>Conus</hi> before paſſed by the Cryſtalline, which was too neer to the Pupilla.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nyctalopia,</hi> or <hi>Nocturna Caecitas,</hi> is when men ſee well enough at day time; at Sun-ſet worſe; and at Night not at all: and it comes from the over thickneſs of the spirits, or Humors, or Tunicles; or the ſtraightneſs of the Pupilla. For in theſe Caſes a greater light is neceſſary for true ſight, which being wanting, at Sun-ſetting, or at Night by a Candle, they ſee little, or not at all.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Veſpertina Acies,</hi> is when men ſee worſe by day, and better by night; and this ſomtimes is called <hi>Nyctalopia,</hi> as we ſee in <hi>Hippocrates, 2. Prorrhet.</hi> but the Modern Greeks have from long Cuſtom uſed the word <hi>Nyctalopia</hi> only for Night blindneſs: it comes from the thinneſs of the spirits which are ſpread abroad by too much light: or from the enlarging of the <hi>Pupilla,</hi> by which too much light goes into the Eye, and hurts the ſight, for a little light at night doth more illuſtrate and ſhine to them, than to thoſe who have the <hi>Pupilla</hi> enlarged.</p>
                     <p>After what manner the ſight is hurt by diminiſhing, aboliſhing, and depraving, we ſhall lay down more plain when we explain the Diſeaſes of all parts of the Eyes by themſelves. For when all the parts of the Eye do conduce to the action of it, namely Sight, when any part is diſtempered, the ſight muſt alſo ſuffer.</p>
                     <p>The Eye is compounded of Tunicles, Humors, and the Optick Nerve, for the action of which parts, the Animal Spirit doth concur as a principal and univerſal Agent.</p>
                     <p>And therefore that we may run through the Diſeaſes of thoſe parts, we will begin from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper of the conſtitution of the optick Nerve; next we will proceed to the Diſeaſe of the Humors and Tunicles. But the faults of the Spirits either depend upon the diſtemper of the Brain, and then other Sences are alſo hurt; or from the diſtemper of the Eye it ſelf, which being cured the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits receive their ancient and due conſtitution, ſo that we need not make a particular tractate of them. But in curing Diſeaſes of the Eyes, when ſight is hurt, we muſt alwaies mingle thoſe things which comfort the viſive ſpirits with other Medicines.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of <hi>Gutta Serena,</hi> or <hi>Amauroſis,</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>WHen the ſight is gone, and no fault appears in the Eyes, it is called <hi>Gutta ſerena,</hi> or <hi>Amau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſis.</hi> And it comes to paſs, when the Animal Spirits cannot paſs from the Brain to the Eyes; for when the Animal Spirits come into the Eyes from the Brain by the Optick Nerves, we muſt find out the ſtoppage of their influx in the Optick Nerves. The Optick Nerves are many waies affected, but chiefly by obſtruction or ſtoppage, aſtriction or binding, and by ſolution of continuity.</p>
                     <p>Obſtruction is the moſt common and moſt ordinary cauſe of <hi>Gutta ſerena,</hi> which comes of a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery humor flowing down from the Brain upon the Nerves, even as other Nerves are obſtructed in a Palſey by the ſame humor; ſo that the Diſeaſes may be ſaid to be alike by reaſon of that Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="63" facs="tcp:49088:42"/>But it is moſt certain that this Diſeaſe is alſo begot by adſtriction and compreſſion of the Optick Nerves; which compreſſion may come both or a moiſt humor gathered about the optick Nerves, and preſſing upon them: as alſo of blood, filth, or matter: Whence ſomtimes certain tumors riſing in thoſe parts, produce the like Diſeaſe. For Experience teacheth, That ſomtimes blindneſs in one Eye, ſomtimes in both, comes upon inflamation of the Brain, and from Phrenzy in malignant Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. And <hi>Platerus</hi> reports <hi>lib.</hi> 1. Obſervation, That he ſaw a blindneſs which came from a round tumor growing in the Brain, and compreſſing the optick Nerves, which appeared by opening of the Head after the Patient was deceaſed.</p>
                     <p>Finally, Wounds in the Head, in which the Optick Nerves are divided, without controverſie do cauſe that the Animal Spirits can no more come to the Eyes.</p>
                     <p>This Diſeaſe is known, in that the Eyes ſeem to be in their natural condition, and there is no fault apparent in them, only the <hi>Pupilla</hi> ſeems blacker and larger. But in diſtinguiſhing the differences of Cauſes, there is great difficulty; for although the Diſeaſe coming of blood or matter is known by inflamation, apoſthume, or wound going before, yet no certain ſign can be given by which we can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh a compreſſion made with flegm from an obſtruction: but we may in ſome part conjecture, for in the obſtruction only of the optick Nerve, the Eye is only affected; but if a compreſſion be made of the ſame Nerve by flegm gathered about the roots of the Eyes and Mamillar Paſſages, that matter poſſeſſeth other parts of the Brain, and then all or ſome of the other Sences are hurt; but if it ſeize only upon the Optick Nerves, there is more plenty of humor ſent forth at the Noſtrils, and the Patient perceives a heavineſs in the fore part of the Head, eſpecially about the Eye-brows.</p>
                     <p>As to the Prognoſtick part; If this Diſeaſe be abſolute, that is, if there be a total loſs of ſight, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if it come from obſtruction of the optick Nerves, it is for the moſt part incurable; as we ſee in Palſeys alſo, that they are ſcarce or never cured which come from the obſtruction of the Nerves, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if the Patient be old. But if the obſtruction be imperfect, which only cauſeth a diminution of ſight, but not blindneſs, there is more hope of recovery, although it cannot be brought about with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much pains, and long uſe of Medicines.</p>
                     <p>But if this Diſeaſe come of humors gathered in the fore part of the head, which compreſs the Nerves, it may be more eaſily cured. So ſaith <hi>Fabricius Hildanus, obſerv. 19. cent.</hi> 5. That a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain man after a ſtrong vomit loſt his ſight, and that he cured him with giving him the ſame Medicine again; for as the humors being too much ſtirred by a violent vomit, and caſt upon the Optick Nerves, compreſſing them, did hinder the paſſage of the Spirits to the Eyes: ſo the ſame humors being carried away by the ſame Medicine, the diſeaſe became cured. Almoſt the like ſtory is mentioned by <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nertus</hi> of a certain Student, who taking too ſtrong a Purge became ſuddenly blind. He alſo affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, That certain women after they had conceived with child, became blind through the ſtraightneſs of the optick Nerves, and that this Diſeaſe went away after four or five months, or in the time of their Delivery.</p>
                     <p>We alſo have ſeen ſome which fell ſuddenly into extream diminution of ſight, who within fifteen daies, were cured by univerſal Evacuations, and ſome revulſions, and by the eaſineſs of the Cure we ſuppoſed that the humor was not faſtened within the ſubſtance of the nerve, but only gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Brain about the original of thoſe Nerves.</p>
                     <p>For the Cure of this Diſeaſe, The matter faſtened upon the Nerves, or cleaving thereto, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the obſtruction or adſtriction, is to be evacuated; which cannot be done, except firſt the whol body be clenſed, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith 4. <hi>meth.</hi> The Eye is not to be cured before the whol Head, nor the Head before the whol Body.</p>
                     <p>And that Remedies may be ſet down in a convenient Method, we will firſt ſet down a Courſe of Diet, which muſt be attenuating and moderately drying.</p>
                     <p>And firſt, The Air muſt incline to hot and dry, and a thick, cold, cloudy, and moiſt Air, muſt be altogether avoided. Let him cat meats of good and laudable Juyce, avoiding them which beget groſs Juyce, as Pork, and all Swines fleſh, Geeſe, Fiſh, Pulſe, Cheeſe, and the like; as thoſe which are windy, and fill the head, as Milk-meats, and hot Spices, <hi>viz.</hi> Pepper and Ginger, &amp;c. Let his Bread be made with Fennel Water, or with the Seeds thereof; being careful that the Wheat of which it is made, be not mixt with Darnel, which all the Ancients beleeved to be very naught for the Sight: hence in the Comedy, he that derideth another for defect in his ſight; I think (ſaith he) thou haſt ſed upon Darnel. In the ſawce to his Meat, and in his Broths, let him uſe things extenuating, as Hyſop, Fennel, Marjoram, Bettony, Sage, Eye-bright, and eſpecially Nutmeg, which ſtrengtheneth the Brain, and clears the Sight. He muſt eat Turneps often, which are thought to quicken the Sight: So do Sparrows, Pidgeons, often eaten. Cold Herbs muſt be forborn, and eſpecially Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, which hurts the Eyes.</p>
                     <p>Let him take but a ſmal quantity of Meat at a time, and let the ſick man never fill himſelf immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately: Let his Supper be leſs than his Dinner: and to abſtain from a Supper twice or thrice in a week is very good. At his Meat, inſtead of Salt let him uſe this Pouder following:</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="64" facs="tcp:49088:43"/>Take of <hi>common Salt two ounces: Eyebright dried two drams: Nutmeg one dram: Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon two ſcruples: Mix them into a Pouder.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After every Meal, let him take one ſpoonful of the Pouder following:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Coriander ſeed prepared half an ounce: Annis ſeeds, and Fennel ſeeds, of each two drams: Cinnamon and Nutmeg, of each one dram: Eyebright dried three drams: Sugar of Roſes, a double weight to all the reſt. Make a Pouder.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wine in this Diſeaſe is not good, becauſe it is too full of vapors, and fills the Head, and is apt to cauſe defluxions: therefore a Deoction of Sarſaparilla, ſweetened with Liquoris, and aromatized with Coriander, will be very profitable. But becauſe the Diſeaſe is of a long continuance, and all cannot abſtain ſo long from Wine; if we muſt permit Wine, let that be choſen that is weakeſt, and leſs vaporing; and it would be more beneficial if Eye-bright dried were firſt ſteeped therein: and that he may make Eyebright Wine for a long time, in the Vintage let him put Eyebright into a veſſel filled with new Wine, and let the Patient uſe that for his ordinary Drink.</p>
                     <p>Let his ſleep be leſs and ſhorter than uſual, and let him he upon his back with his face upwards as much as may be: Let him avoid ſleeping at noon, becauſe it is very hurtful. Let his Exerciſe be moderate, and inſtead of exerciſe let him uſe frictions or rubbing of the inferior parts. Let his Belly be alwaies kept looſe, and let him avoid diſturbance of mind.</p>
                     <p>The courſe of Diet being thus ordered, you muſt begin your Cure from Univerſal Evacuation And firſt you muſt purge with the following Medicine:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>clean Senna half an ounce: Fennel ſeeds one dram: the Leaves of Bettony, Eyebright and Vervain, of each half a handful: Liquoris three drams: Boyl them to three ounces. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve in the ſtraining three drams of Diaphaenicon; Syrup of Roſes one ounce. Make a Potion and give it in the morning with orderly Government.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After this firſt Purge, let the Phyſitian conſider ſeriouſly with himſelf, whether he may bleed or not. For it is diſallowed in this caſe by almoſt all Practitioners, becauſe it is a Chronical Diſeaſe of long continuance, coming of a cold diſtemper and of a flegmy humor. Hence they fear leaſt by blood-letting, the Brain ſhould be made more cold, and ſo beget more flegm, and leaſt the conjunct cauſe of the Diſeaſe ſhould be more increſſated or thickened, and ſo become more difficult to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed and diſſipated. But although their Opinion may take place as to old men, and ſuch as are of a Phlegmatick Conſtitution, yet it is not to be admitted to them that are yong, or of a hot Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, eſpecially if there be manifeſt ſigns that blood doth predominate; for then there is no doubt but ſeaſonable blood-letting may much profit. Nay, where the aforeſaid ſigns of blood do appear, it is profitable in the judgment of <hi>Paulus</hi> and <hi>Aetius</hi> after the Vein in the Arm is opened, to open the particular Veins of the Head, and thoſe which are neereſt the Eyes, namely, the Frontal and Temple Veins, and thoſe which are in the corners of the Eyes neer the root of the Noſe. But you may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter apply Horſ-leeches to the Forehead, as alſo behind the Ears. Some Practitioners do relate, that ſome by a wound in the Forehead have been cured of blindneſs. In which it is moſt probable that the cauſe of their blindneſs was the compreſſion of the optick Nerves by the Veins and Arteries adjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and ſwelling with too much blood, which the Wounds aforeſaid emptied forth. Whence <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelius</hi> (as <hi>Plempius</hi> reports in his Book of the Eyes) was wont in <hi>Gutta ſerena</hi> with good ſucceſs to open the middle Vein in the Forehead, and let it bleed while it ſtop of it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>But if the ſuppreſſion of the terms went before this Diſeaſe, you muſt draw blood from the lower veins, or apply Leeches to the Hemorrhoids: if the Patient had formerly a flux thereof, which then is ſtopped, or if he have a very hot Liver, or be of a melancholly temper.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards the whole body is to be more exactly purged by this following Apozeme.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Fennel Roots, and Sarſaparilla, and Flower-de-luce-roots, and Elicampane roots, of each one ounce: the Leaves of Bettony, Marjoram, Balm, Eyebright, Fennel, Vervain and Celendine the great, of each one handful: Liquoris ſliced, and Raiſons of the Sun ſtoned, of each one ounce: Annis-ſeed, and Fennel-ſeed of each three drams: clenſed Senna two ounces: Gum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my Turbith and Agerick newly made into Troches, of each two drams: Ginger and Cloves of each one ſcruple: flowers of Stoechas, Roſemary, and Lavender, of each one ſmall handful: Boyl them in five quarters; that is a pint and a quarter of water; diſſolve in the ſtraigning four ounces of white ſugar: make an Apozeme, clarifie it and perfume it with two drams of the beſt cinnamon, for four mornings draughts: After the Apozeme is done, let him take theſe Pills.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the maſs of Pill, Lucis major, and Cochia the leſs, of each half a dram: malax them with Bettony water, make ſix guilded Pills thereof, which let him take early in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After this general Evacuation the antecedent Cauſe is to be revelled; and the conjunct Cauſe is to be derived and diſcuſſed. For this Frictions of the extream parts, eſpecially beneath, are to be uſed every morning.</p>
                     <p>Cupping-Glaſſes muſt be applied to the ſhoulders and back without ſacrification; eſpecially to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49088:43"/>
the hinder part of the Head with ſcarification; for they do ſo powerfully draw the humors from the fore-parts and the principle of the Nerves, that ſome preſently after the application thereof have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered their ſight: At the ſame time apply a Veſicatory to the hinder part of the neck, and let the Blyſters that are raiſed be kept long open, with Beet or Colewort Leaves often applied.</p>
                     <p>When the Veſicatory is dried up, apply a Cauſtick to the hinder part of the head or neck between the ſecond or third Vertebra; or (as it is now moſt uſual) apply two Cauſticks to the Neck behind upon the fourth and fifth Vertebra; ſo that the back bone may lie untouched between them, and both may be Cured with one Playſter.</p>
                     <p>Inſtead of Cauteries a Seton applied to the ſame part is moſt efficacious; but the tenderneſs of our Country men hath almoſt aboliſhed the uſe thereof.</p>
                     <p>If the aforeſaid Cauteries avail not, you may lay a potential Cautery to the Coronal Suture, which ſometimes hath done the work when other Remedies have failed.</p>
                     <p>When theſe things are doing, preſently after univerſal Evacuation by ſeege, you muſt order a ſweating Diet of the Decoction of Guajacum Saſſaphras, and the Roots of Sarſa, according to the method preſcribed by us in the Cure of the Cold diſtemper of the Brain. Obſerving this; That to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of the Sudorifick Decoction, you and thoſe things which peculiarly reſpect the Eyes; as Vervain, Fennel, Eyebright, and Celondine the greater.</p>
                     <p>And for the better drying of the Brain; let the Bags preſcribed in the Chapter above mentioned be applied to the Temples if you fear not an inflamation.</p>
                     <p>Alſo after the Sudorifick Diet it is very convenient to uſe Sulpherous and Bituminous Baths and waſhings of the head; becauſe they are very proper for the correcting of a Cold and Moiſt Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, for the conſuming of Flegm, and ſtrengthening the brain.</p>
                     <p>Beſides the univerſal Evacuation of the body and Head, particular may be ordered; as Medicines that cauſe ſpitting; called Apophlegmatiſin; by which the Rhewm is brought out of the Brain by the Pallate; which may be made either in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>orm of a Gargariſm or Maſticatory; according to the forms preſcribed in the Cure of the cold diſtemper of the brain.</p>
                     <p>Errhins and Sternutatories or Neeſings are condemned by almoſt al Practitioners in this Diſeaſe; becauſe they draw humors to the eyes: but yet if ſome of the milder and gentler ſort be uſed (after an exact purging of the whoſe body and head) for ſome few dayes they may be profitable in regard they may by degrees draw forth and derive the humor which cauſeth the Diſeaſe, and is faſtned in the Optick Nerves; nor can they fetch any thing from the profound part of the brain to the fore-parts: Otherwiſe in every derivation which is an evacuation by the part affected, or that which is neer unto it; we ſhould alwayes fear leſt there ſhould be an attraction to the part affected, which is eaſily hindered by univerſal Evacuations which ought to precede; and thoſe Errhins may be made of the juyce of Beets and Marjoram with white Wine in which Manna hath been diſſolved.</p>
                     <p>But a ſtronger and yet ſafe Errhine may be made of the powder of Tobacco corrected with Cepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, and Oxydorcicks; or Medicines that help the ſight; for by that the Rhewm is drawn forth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Palate than the Noſtrils; and the brain is ſo fortified, that it wil not ſo eaſily receive the defluxion of humors from other parts. The Compoſition whereof is as followeth.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>dryed Tobacco one ounce: the leaves of Sage, Marjoram, Bettony, Eyebright, the Flowers of Clove-gilli-flowers, and Red Roſes, of each one dram: make a pouder to be ſnufft into the Noſtrils for ſome few dayes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Neither is it ſufficient once to clenſe the Body of Excrementitious Humors with univerſal Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but you muſt keep it in that condition all the time of the Cure; therefore with Purges inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed, the Excrements which daily encreaſe muſt be brought forth; which may be done with uſual Pills made after this manner;</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the beſt Aloes half an ounce: clean Senna, Turbith, Hermodacts, and Agarick new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly trochiſcated, of each two drams: Diagridium, one dram: Mace, Cloves, and Eaſtern-Saffron, of each ſeven grains: sprinkle them with the juyces of Marjoram and the greater Celon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine: then dry them again in the ſhade. And with the Oxymel of Squills make a maſs of Pills of which let him take half a dram or two ſcruples twice or thrice in a month.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>While theſe things are uſed, you muſt continually labor to ſtrengthen the brain and the eyes: and the Patient muſt take diverſity of Medicines, leſt by taking the ſame a long time, it prove Nauſeous unto him; and leſt Nature be too much enured to a Medicine, and ſo it looſe its Operation. Old Phyſitians ſay, Treacle is reputed to be of excellent vertue to this purpoſe, which may be taken by a dram every night with Fennel, Eyebright, or Celondine water twice or thrice in a week. Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meg eaten every morning faſting, is much commended if it be long chewed that the vapor may be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the Eyes; if you fear that the ſwallowing down thereof ſhould offend by reaſon of the heat: it may be ſpit forth after it is chewed. Candid Myrabolans taken in the morning are thought to clear the ſight exceedingly.</p>
                     <p>The uſual Opiate is thus made:</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="66" facs="tcp:49088:44"/>Take of <hi>Conſerve of Bettony, and Roſemary flowers, of each two ounces: Candied Myrobalans two: old Treacle two drams: the Leaves of Eyebright poudered, three drams: Fennelſeed two drams: Nutmeg, Cinnamon, and Cloves, of each one ſcruple: With the Syrup of the Juyce of Fennel, Rue, and Celondine made up with Honey, make an Opiate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let him take thereof the bigneſs of a Cheſnut, drinking after it a little Wine mixed with Fennel Water.</p>
                     <p>Nor muſt you omit external Medicines which ſtrengthen, warm, and dry the Head; of which ſort is the Cephalick Pouder for the Hair, a Cap and Fumigation, mentioned by us in the Cure of the cold diſtemper of the Brain.</p>
                     <p>Finally, You may apply Topical Medicines to the Eyes to ſtrengthen them: theſe are uſual in Authors; but they are of little force which cannot reach to the optick Nerves; but if any deſire to try ſome of them, they may find enough of them in my Treatiſe of the Cure of a Suffuſion.</p>
                     <p>In a deſperate caſe when all other Medicines have been uſed in vain, a Veſicatory applied over the whol Head (being ſhaven) in form of a Cap, hath many times been very ſucceſsful: if it be twice or thrice uſed after the drying up of the former Bliſters, it is more advantagious.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the Diſeaſe of the Vitrous, or Glaſſy Humor.</head>
                     <p>THe Vitrous Humor is next under the Cryſtalline, and therefore it is made by Nature tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, that the Species carried to the optick Nerve may be pure and clean. If therefore the cleerneſs of that humor be hindered by the mixture of another, and ſo made dusky: according to the degree of that duskineſs or foulneſs, the ſight is either diminiſhed or aboliſhed.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, This humor may be out of order in reſpect of its ſcituation; namely, when any part of it by a blow or contuſion ſhall be brought before the Cryſtalline; for then the ſight will be dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened, in regard the vitrous Humor is more thick than the watery, and therefore the ſpecies of the objects cannot be carried pure and cleer unto the Cryſtalline.</p>
                     <p>The firſt affect, namely the Mixion of a Humor with it, cannot be perceived by any ſigns, but only it is judged probable by reaſon, for the vitrous Humor cannot be ſeen, or its condition known; and therefore Practitioners are conſtrained to confound it, and to make it one with <hi>Gutta ſerena,</hi> becauſe no fault appears in the Eye, and this they do without offence to the Patient, in regard any humors that are mixed with the vitrous, are to be diſcuſſed with the ſame Remedies that a <hi>Gutta ſerena</hi> is cured.</p>
                     <p>But you may know that this vitrous humor is diſordered in reſpect of its Scituation, when it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth white under the <hi>Pupilla,</hi> yet it is not eaſily diſtinguiſhed from Suffuſion, except the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent and firſt cauſe be diligently obſerved. For a Suffuſion is cauſed by a ſimple defluxion of an humor; but this tranſpoſition or diſplacing of the vitrous humor uſeth to come of a Wound or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſion.</p>
                     <p>This laſt Diſeaſe is incurable, for the vitrous humor being diſplaced can by no art be reduced to its former condition. But this by Nature hath ſometimes been done, and therefore the whol buſineſs is to be committed unto her.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the Diſeaſes in the Cryſtalline Humor.</head>
                     <p>THe Cryſtalline Humor is the chief inſtrument of Sight, and therefore ought to be kept more pure and perſpicuous than the reſt, that that Sence may more freely be exerciſed. And if it be ſoiled in the leaſt meaſure, the ſence of Seeing is much hindered.</p>
                     <p>The chief Diſeaſe whereby the purity thereof is infected, is called <hi>Glaucoma</hi> (or the changing of the Cryſtalline Humor into a fiery redneſs) and this happens when the Cryſtalline Humor is made thick by dryneſs, as in old people, from ſome drying and condenſing cauſe it is often ſeen.</p>
                     <p>This Diſeaſe is known, by a plain appearance of a thick white about the <hi>Pupilla,</hi> and when all objects are apprehended by the Patient as through a cloud or ſmoak. But it is hard to diſtinguiſh this Diſeaſe from a Suffuſion which repreſenteth ſuch a whiteneſs about the <hi>Pupilla:</hi> hence it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is that many Authors do not diſtinguiſh between a <hi>Glaucoma</hi> and a Suffuſion. But they which dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently obſerve may diſtinguiſh them thus: In a Suffuſion there is a white in the very Pupilla, and very neer the Membrane called <hi>Cornea;</hi> but in a <hi>Glaucoma</hi> it lieth deeper.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="67" facs="tcp:49088:44"/>This Diſeaſe is incurable; eſpecially in old folk in whom the drineſs of the part cannot be amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; but if it be not manifeſt that the fault is in the Cryſtalline, and there is a ſuſpition of a ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>h objects appear double, comes not only of the Cauſe now mentioned, but alſo from vapors, or water which hurt the Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalline; by which the viſive Spirits are divided, whence it comes to paſs that the ſpecies of the ſame thing is received into two places, which Drunkards uſually per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Secondly, The ſcituation of the Cryſtalline is altered, when it declineth backward or cometh forward, if it comes forward to the Pupilla, then things neer at hand are not ſo rightly perceived as thoſe which are more remote, as in old men often. But if it decline backward towards the Optick Nerve, things neer are truly ſeen, but not afar off, and then is the Diſeaſe called <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

                        </gap> which was mentioned in the Preface; where we ſhewed, That theſe Diſeaſes are only Cured by Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The Cryſtalline is out of its place when it tendeth either to the right or left ſide, which is called <hi>Strabiſmus,</hi> or Squinting; when the <hi>Pupilla</hi> is not directly but oblique upon the Object, and appeareth not in the middle of the Eye, but in one ſide: ſo that there appeareth more white in one part of the Eye, than in the other.</p>
                     <p>This Diſeaſe comes not only from the diſplacing of the Cryſtalline, but alſo from the Evil Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Muſcles which move the Eyes: which is either natural, or elſe proceeds from a Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey or Convulſion of the ſaid Muſcles.</p>
                     <p>Of what Cauſe ſoever it c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Finally, Other Depravations of ſight may come from the inverſion of the Cryſtalline be it grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or leſs; as when ſtreight things appear crooked, or when the Objects ſeem to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>oulded: which happened to a certain Phyſitian (as <hi>Sennertus</hi> reports) who going up a Ladder to take a Book from a ſhelf, and turning his Eyes violently upwards, ſaw al things afterwards turned upwards as though men walked upon their Heads, which ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e by the attraction and diſplacing of the Cryſtalline. For a quarter of a yeer after when again he turned up his Eyes violently, his natural ſight returned, and al things appeared in right order.</p>
                     <p>Hence it appears that by a violent motion of the Eye that the Cryſtalline may be diſplaced, and again by the ſame motion be ſet right. I ſuppoſe that the diſplacing of the Cryſtalline was thus, It was ſo inverted that the fore-part of it (which is more depreſſed than the other) was not right againſt the <hi>Pupilla;</hi> but rather its ſide which being more round and convex might repreſent the ſpecies of the Objects inverted, as we may obſerve in round Glaſſes, which diſcover the Object inverted; and this is true from the principles of the Optick art: for in a Medium that is Convex and thick, the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are ſo broken, and as it were croſs-cut, That they which come from the upper part of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, do repreſent the lower part; and ſo contrarily, but if the inverſion of the Cryſtalline be leſs, ſo as both the depreſſed part of the Cryſtalline and alſo the Convex part thereof, be right again<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>Pupilla,</hi> the Objects may ſeem crooked. Although that Depravation of ſight whereby Objects ſeem crooked, may come by other means: namely when any part of the Cryſtalline is mixed with the watery humor then by reaſon of inequality of the Cryſtalline in regard of thickneſs, the refractions are divers, which are the Cauſe of Depravation of ſight whereby things appear crooked. This may be demonſtrated by a clear Example: A ſtaffe put half into the water, appears crooked for this Cauſe, namely, The ſpecies of that part in the water, when it is carried out of the water into the air, from a thicker to a thinner Medium, is broken by the perpendicular; but that part which is in the air is not broken, becauſe it doth not paſs through divers Mediums as that which is in the water: Hence it comes that the ſtick ſeems crooked. After the ſame manner the ſpecies of the object which is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into the thicker part of the Cryſtalline is more broken, than that which is carried to the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which is in its natural ſtate, and not mixed underneath with the watery humor; and ſo by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the divers refractions the objects appear crooked.</p>
                     <p>But ſince Medicines are to no purpoſe, we ſhal preſcribe none for theſe Diſeaſes.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the Diſeaſes of the Watery Humor, and eſpecially of a Suffuſion.</head>
                     <p>THe Watery Humor is out of its Natural Condition, when it is diſtempered in quantity or quality. When the Diſtemper is in quantity; it is enlarged or diminiſhed, and makes the <hi>Pupilla</hi> be dilated or contracted, which Diſeaſes ſhall be mentioned in their places. When the diſtemper is in quality, it becomes thicker, and that comes from another Humor mixed with it, and that is called Suffuſion, which we here ſpeak of. For although <hi>Galen 1. de Symp. cauſ. cap.</hi> 2. ſheweth that a Suffuſion may come from the condenſation of the watery humor without the acceſs of an excrementitious Humor: yet becauſe it happens ſeldom, and is known rather by imagination than art, and is altogether incurable: omitting that, we ſhall ſpeak of that Suffuſion only which cometh from the afflux of another excrement or humor. This is called in Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, in Latin <hi>Suffuſio,</hi> by the Arabians, Water, vulgarly a <hi>Cataract.</hi> Some Authors would diſtinguiſh theſe names, and make them ſignifie divers ſorts of this Diſeaſe: They call it in the beginning (when the ſight is only a little darkened) a Suffuſion; but when it is grown older, and ſomthing gathered into the Pupil appears like water, then they call it only <hi>Aqua,</hi> Water: but when the matter is grown thick in the Pupilla, and the ſight almoſt gone, then they call it a Cataract. A Suffuſion comes from a ſerous Watery Humor ſpread in the ſpace between the Cornea and the Cryſtalline: and ſince a Watery Humor is contained in that ſpace, it may well be reckoned among the Diſeaſes of the Watery Humor.</p>
                     <p>This is the Cauſe of a true Suffuſion: There is another Baſtard Suffuſion which comes from va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors ſent from the Stomach and other parts into the Eyes. <hi>Galen 4. de loc. aff. cap.</hi> 2. taught that vapors may be ſent from the Head to the Eyes, and make a baſtard Suffuſion; but although Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors ſpeak of two ſorts of Suffuſions, yet they are for the moſt part united, and a ſpurious or falſe pleureſie is complicated or joyned with a true one; becauſe vapors ſent from the lower parts to the Brain, are eaſily carried to thoſe parts of the Head which are weakened with any Diſeaſe, and this appears in that all troubled with Suffuſions are leſs troubled, and ſee better in the morning than at noon or night, becauſe after dinner or ſupper many vapors are ſent up from the Stomach to the Eyes which diſturb the ſight. And Experience teacheth, That men ſo diſeaſed have their ſight more dull and dark preſently after meat, than a few hours after. Moreover, all that have a Suffuſion relate that they ſee in the Air little bodies, as Gnats, Flyes, Hairs, Cobwebs, and the like; which could not be but by the groſs vapors which are ſent to the Eye, and there move: for although Authors ſuppoſe that theſe repreſentations depend upon ſome thick Humors contained in the Eye, which make a Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion: yet this is not credible, Becauſe then it ſhould alwaies move in the Eye, to repreſent thoſe little Bodies which fly in the ayr, which is contrary to reaſon. But rather without queſtion, the vapors are in perpetual motion, and ſo can repreſent thoſe flying fancies.</p>
                     <p>A Watery Humor is the chief and moſt ordinary cauſe of a Suffuſion, yet other Humors at leaſt in a ſmal quantity may be mixed therewith: and if Choller be mixed, then it is citrine or yellowiſh; if Melancholly, then it is a black Suffuſion.</p>
                     <p>And thoſe Humors uſe to ſlow to the Eyes when they are weak, either Naturally, or by Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
                     <p>From a Natural debility comes a thruſting forth of the Eyes, for they who have ſuch Eyes, are very ſubject to a Suffuſion; for ſuch Eyes uſe to be great, and therefore the vertue ſpread abroad is leſs in them: as alſo by reaſon of their largeneſs they do more eaſily receive humors and vapors. External cauſes make an accidental or adventitious debility, as a ſtroak, contuſion, baths, a Southern and rainy habitation or ſeaſon, heat of the Sun, ſmoak, continual reading, eſpecially by candle light, and the like: All which may alſo cauſe a flux of humors to the Eyes.</p>
                     <p>Now the Humors flow from the Brain to the Eyes by the Veins, by the Tunicle called <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vea,</hi> and by the Optick Nerve. The Veins by which they flow are divers: either thoſe which come from the <hi>Pericranium</hi> to the <hi>Conjunctiva,</hi> thence to the <hi>Cornea</hi> and <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vea:</hi> or thoſe which come from the <hi>Men<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>nges,</hi> from which ſome branches come to the Membranes of the Eye, from which Membranes, eſpecially from the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vea,</hi> the excrementitious humors may eaſily fall into the watery humor being ſo neer.</p>
                     <p>Finally, Humors may eaſily be carried by the Optick from the Brain; by the <hi>Tunica Retifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis</hi> and <hi>Aranea,</hi> to the Cryſtalline; and then the matter of the Suffuſion ſticks upon the ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Cryſtalline. Although a Suffuſion for the moſt part comes by a defluxion, yet ſomtimes
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49088:45"/>
it may come by congeſtion or gathering, when that nouriſhment of the Eye is not well changed, and the expulſive Faculty is ſo weak that it cannot expel ſufficiently the remaining excrements, ſo that they are by degrees gathered together about the <hi>Pupilla,</hi> and ſo make a Suffuſion, in which caſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther humors are ordinarily diſturbed, and difficult diſeaſes are produced.</p>
                     <p>The Differences of a Suffuſion are taken from the thickneſs and quantity of the humor cauſing it, and from the place in which the humor reſideth.</p>
                     <p>In regard of thickneſs more or leſs, the ſight is more or leſs offended, for if the humor be thin and ſerous, of which the Suffuſion is made, which is cured by pricking, as <hi>Galen</hi> taught 14. <hi>Meth. cap. ult.</hi> The ſight is little worſe, and it is called a Suffuſion only begun, if it be ſomwhat thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker the ſight is darker; if very thick blindneſs followeth.</p>
                     <p>In reſpect of the quantity and the place, Either the humor poſſeſſeth the whol Eye, and the ſight is equally hindered which way ſoever it be directed; or it poſſeſſeth one part of the Pupil more than another, and ſo the objects are not ſeen wholly at one direct view, nor can many objects be ſeen at one time: but if the humor be very little, and poſſeſs the middle of the Pupilla, the objects appear with holes through them. But if the matter be divided into divers parts, poſſeſſing divers parts of the Pupilla, the forms of Gnats ſhall ſeem to be before the eyes: All theſe differences are exactly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed by <hi>Galen, 1. de ſymp. cauſis, c.</hi> 2.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, In reſpect of the place or Scituation of the matter, other differences may be made, as ſomtimes the matter is in the very hole or cavity of the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vea</hi> about the <hi>Cornea;</hi> ſomtimes about the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vea,</hi> and between that and the watery humor; ſometimes it is mixed with the Watery Humor; and finally, ſomtimes it is between the Cryſtalline and Watery Humor.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some Differences may be taken from the figure or ſhape of the matter, which <hi>Galen</hi> relates 1. <hi>de ſympt. cauſis cap.</hi> 2. and 4. <hi>de loc. affect. cap.</hi> 2. for as the figure of the humor adjacent to the Pupil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la is various, ſo divers objects are preſent thereunto, as Gnats, Hairs, Cobwebs, Circles about Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, and other things.</p>
                     <p>The knowledg of this Diſeaſe, is firſt in diſtinguiſhing a true from a baſtard Suffuſion, and then in the diſcovery of the differences of true and right Suffuſions.</p>
                     <p>A true Suffuſion doth for the moſt part affect only one Eye; but if both be affected, they are not at one time, or alike affected, as in a ſpurious Suffuſion.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, In a true Suffuſion, ſome dark matter appeareth in the Pupilla, which doth not in a Spurious or Baſtard Suffuſion. But this is not alwaies a true ſign; for if the Suffuſion cometh of a thin and ſerous humor, becauſe it is no thicker than the Watery humor, there appeareth no change in the Eye, by which Phyſitians are ſomtimes deceived, not knowing that kind of Suffuſion, take it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for <hi>Gutta ſerena,</hi> perceiving no change in the Pupilla: but this kind is eaſily diſtinguiſhed from <hi>Gutta ſerena.</hi> Firſt, in <hi>Gutta ſerena</hi> the ſight is quite gone, or much diminiſhed, no hurt appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the Eye: On the contrary, In a Suffuſion which we cannot ſee, there is only a ſmal decay of ſight, becauſe the ſerous humor from whence it proceeds, is thin, and tranſparent, ſo that it may be pierced by the ſpecies of objects like Glaſs. Secondly, They differ in this, For the moſt part in a Suffuſion, the Sight is not equally hindered in all parts of the Pupilla; but the objects ſomtimes are ſeen better when they are direct before the Eye, ſomtimes when they are oppoſite to the corner of the Eye, becauſe the humor is thicker or thinner in one part of the Pupilla than the other.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, In a true Suffuſion the Symptomes are continual, and have no intermiſſion: in a baſtard Suffuſion, they are ſomtimes encreaſed and remitted, as the vapors are more or leſs which are ſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Brain. So they are fewer when the Stomach is empty, than when it is full, eſpecially preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after meat, for then a greater company of vapors do aſcend, which ſent to the Eyes, repreſent to the ſight, Flies, Gnats, Cobwebs, and ſuch like ſmal bodies, not alwaies, but at ſome times only. Which little bodies repreſented in the Air, depend upon the Vapors as aforeſaid: but in regard the Eyes are weakned by a true Suffuſion there is almoſt a continual ſending up of vapors unto them, and therfore there is a continual appearance of theſe little bodies flying in the Air. Moreover, there is a conſtant darkneſs of ſight in a true Suffuſion, being alwaies after the ſame manner, as if all the objects were ſeen through a cloud or thick glaſs, which is the proper ſign of this Diſeaſe: but in a baſtard Suffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, there is ſomtimes a greater, ſomtimes a leſs, and ſomtimes almoſt no dimneſs at al of the Sight, even as the vapors are many, or few, or none that are ſent to the Eyes.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, A true Suffuſion grows in a ſhort time, and is confirmed for the moſt part in ſix Months, and ſomtimes it encreaſeth in a few daies: and <hi>Fernelius</hi> ſaith, 5. <hi>Pathol. cap.</hi> 5. that a Suffuſion was perfect in one day, which we alſo have often ſeen: but a baſtard Suffuſion continueth many yeers without encreaſe.</p>
                     <p>The Differences among true Suffuſions are theſe:</p>
                     <p>In a Suffuſion beginning certain ſmal Bodies, as Hairs, Gnats, Flyes, pieces of Wool and Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>webs, fly before the Eyes.</p>
                     <p>But when it is far gone, the Air appears cloudy, and the objects are ſeen thicker, as through a
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:49088:46"/>
glaſs; the colour of the Pupilla is changed, and it appears either troubled or cloudy, or like filthy Glaſs, or of a sky colour when a ſuffuſion is perfect, the ſight totally periſheth: the Pupilla is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther white, or of ſome other colour is mixed with white.</p>
                     <p>Some ſignes are taken from the Colour: for when it is like a Pearl in colour, it ſignifies that the flegm is ſtill fluid and tranſparent: when it is white as Chalk, then it ſignifies a thick and compacted matter: when yellow, then flegm and choller are mixed: when black, it ſhews Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly.</p>
                     <p>The Place in which the Suffuſion grows, is thus known; For if the matter be placed between the Uuea and Cornea, the Pupil appeareth more dark, becauſe the matter is neerer to the beholder<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Moreover the Pupilla is dilated by the Humor contained therein; and when the Diſeaſe is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, white or red veins, or ſwellings are perceived to be about the Iris, or circle of the Eye; or cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain white ſpots appear about the Pupilla.</p>
                     <p>If the Matter be contained between the Cryſtalline and the Uuea, contrary ſymptoms wil appear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as alſo the Pupilla wil be contracted if the matter lie deep, and enlarged if the matter lie higher.</p>
                     <p>The Prognoſtick of this Diſeaſe, is to be diverſly made, according to divers ſeaſons: For when a Suffuſion is only begun, when the Patient can perceive an object as through a cloud, it is curable as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, 14. Meth. Cap. ult. and <hi>Celſus</hi> lib. 6. cap. 6. which Opinion wants a reſtriction: Namely, if the Patient be yong, but in old it is incurable: and if the eyes be not naturally of a weak conſtitution. We alſo have ſeen ſome that have been cured in fifteen dayes ſpace, of a Suffuſion new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly began; who have been above fifty years of age, only by univerſal Purging, ſweating Diet, and a Veſicatory, without any other application of Topicks.</p>
                     <p>This Cure is better wrought in a warm air and in ſummer time, becauſe the Pores are then open, the matter of the Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>If a Suffuſion come from an acute Feaver, a Peripneumonia, a Phrenzy, or from a violent pain of the Head, it is hard to be Cured.</p>
                     <p>A Cataract or Suffuſion confirmed when the matter is grown thick, cannot be diſcuſſed with Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, but muſt be couched with a Needle.</p>
                     <p>This Operation is not ſafe; and often hath ill ſucceſs: For either the Tunicle Uuea is torn, or by the pain and inflamation, a new flux of Humors is brought to the Eye, which hath been long before weak: and many other inconveniences by which the ſight is for ever loſt. But ſince this Operation hath been ſometime ſuccesful, it may be tryed by thoſe who have no other hopes of Cure; For it is better, as <hi>Celſus</hi> ſaith, to try a Doubtful Medicine, or Remedy, than None at all.</p>
                     <p>In a confirmed Cataract, if when the other Eye is ſhut the Pupilla appeareth larger in the Eye affected, there is hope of Cure by Couching; but if it be no larger, it is uncurable; as <hi>Galen</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, 1. <hi>deſymp. cauſ. cap.</hi> 2. becauſe the optick Nerve is obſtructed, and the ſpirits cannot come to the Pupilla, though it be open.</p>
                     <p>But if the Patient perceive no light when the Pupilla is enlarged by the ſhutting of the other Eye, he cannot be recovered by the Needle, becauſe the viſive ſpirit is troubled and obſcure, and therefore unfit for ſight.</p>
                     <p>A black Cataract, free from al brightneſs, can neither be Cured by Phyſick, nor Chirurgery; becauſe the Viſive Spirits are deſtroyed; but a cleer Cataract that hath ſome ſplendor, is Cure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                     <p>Theſe alſo are uncurable for the moſt part, a green, dark, very yellow, and hard Cataract; and that which moveth and is colored like quickſilver.</p>
                     <p>A Cataract which repreſenteth objects ful of holes, is not to be tampered with: For ſince the matter is in the Center of the Pupilla, it is to be feared, leſt when the Needle is thruſt in, the whol Pupilla be filled with the matter, and ſo the fight be utterly loſt.</p>
                     <p>The Operation of the Needle, is more ſuccesful, in a ful Eye; and that which keeps its natural greatneſs: But if the Eye be ſmal and decayed, it is leſs ſuccesful.</p>
                     <p>In Old men, this Operation is not to be tryed; nor in Children, in them the Diſeaſe is incurable; in theſe the Humor is too ſoft being not ripe; there is moſt hope of ſucceſs in yong perſons.</p>
                     <p>If this Operation be, when ſome part of the Suffuſion floweth down (if the eye be compreſſed) and appeareth more large, and after returneth to its former ſtation and figure, it is not ſuccesful; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Cataract is not yet ripe, but thin and crude: But if by a compreſſing with the finger there is no change of the ſhape and figure of it; it is then ripe, and may be couched with a Needle. But we muſt take notice, That the ripeneſs or thickneſs of the Cataract ought to be moderate and not too much compacted, that it may be eaſily couched: for it ought to be like a thin skin which may be row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led about the Needle and ſo couched down; for if it be too thick and ſolid, it cannot be couched,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:49088:46"/>
which you may perceive when it is like Chalk or Hail. Contrarily that which is fit for couching u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to be Sky-colored, and Sea-green, of the color of Iron or Lead not black.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of a Cataract muſt be directed not only to the Conjunct, but to the Antecedent cauſe. And therefore you muſt purge the whol Body, and eſpecially the Brain very exactly. After you muſt diſcuſs that humor which obſtructeth the Pupilla, and ſome way ſoften it.</p>
                     <p>Which intentions, when they are almoſt the ſame which were propounded in the Cure of <hi>Gutta ſerena,</hi> we may uſe the ſame Remedies for Diet, evacuation or purging of the whol Body, for revul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the humor offending, and for the ſtrengthening of the Head and the Eyes, ſo we ſhall not in vain repeat them.</p>
                     <p>Having therefore firſt uſed all that Method which was laid down for the Cure of <hi>Gutta ſerena,</hi> we will declare unto you thoſe Medicines, which belong properly to the taking away of the matter about the Pupilla. And though Topical Medicines are counted little worth according to <hi>Galens</hi> Opinion, 2. <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, who ſaith that they promiſe more than they can perform: yet their Lawful uſe is not to be rejected: and Experience hath taught, by very good Authors confirmed, that Cataracts in their beginning, after univerſal Medicines uſed, have been cured with Topicks, that is, Medicines applied to the Eye.</p>
                     <p>Firſt therefore begin with mild diſſolvers, and ſuch as dry not overmuch leſt the matter grow hard, and be made unfit to be diſſolved: then uſe mollifiers with your diſſolvers, that induration may be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and it may more eaſily be diſſolved. For this purpoſe the following Fornentation may be firſt uſed.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Leaves of Rue, Fennel, Eyebright, the greater Celondine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of each one handful: Foenugreek ſeeds one ounce: Chamomel and Melilot flowers, of each one pugil: Boyl them in three parts of ſpring Water, and one part of white Wine added towards the end of the Decoction. Foment the Eyes with a ſoft ſpunge dipt in the ſtrained Liquor, morning and evening.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of the ſame Decoction you may make a Fumigation, covering the head that it may be received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Eyes.</p>
                     <p>In the beginning of the Diſeaſe, while the defluxion is new, and that revelling Medicines are uſed, it is good to waſh the Eyes with only red Wine, which by its aſtriction hinders the defluxion, and by its ſpirits diſcuſſeth and diſſolveth it.</p>
                     <p>In the progreſs of the Diſeaſe, a Fomentation of white Wine, in which <hi>Crocus Metallorum</hi> hath been infuſed, is moſt profitable.</p>
                     <p>It is no leſs profitable to let a child eat ſweet Fennel Seeds in a morning, and afterwards breath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Eyes.</p>
                     <p>As alſo to let him lick them, or to let a Dog lick them.</p>
                     <p>Alſo Bread hot from the Oven, in which is ſweet Fennel ſeed cut in the middle, may be ſo placed to the Eyes that they may behold it when they are wet with the vapor.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Medicines are to be uſed in the morning.</p>
                     <p>At night you may apply this Cataplaſm:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Fenugreek ſeed beaten one ounce: Aloes half an ounce: Saffron one dram: Make them into fine pouder, put it into white Wine wherein</hi> Crocus Metallorum <hi>hath been infuſed, and make a Cataplaſm to be applied to the Eyes at night.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Many commend Pidgeons blood, put hot into the Eyes, for with the Natural heat of that Creature the part will be much ſtrengthened, and the excrementitious matter diſſolved: but becauſe the heat will quickly depart from the blood, it is better to take a yong callow Pidgeon, and ſlit it in the back, and apply it to the Eye.</p>
                     <p>With theſe Medicines you may diſcuſs the matter if it be poſſible.</p>
                     <p>Topical Medicines called <hi>Collyria,</hi> which are dropped into the Eyes, are of little force, and thoſe are they which <hi>Galen</hi> ſaid did promiſe more than they perform; for all their vertue is ſpent in the <hi>Cornea;</hi> neither can they reach to the internal parts, except they be made very ſharp, by which, pain would be cauſed, and a greater defluxion: hence many that have uſed them immoderately, have from a light infirmity become ſtark blind. But becauſe many of thoſe <hi>Collyriaes</hi> are found in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors which have good report by them, leſt we ſhould ſeem defective, we will ſhew ſome of the choy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt, that they who pleaſe may try them.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the beſt Honey two pints: Fennel Roots, and the Roots of long and round Birthwort, of each one pound: the leaves of Rue, Eyebright, Celondine the greater, and the tops of Fennel, of each ſix handfuls: Centaury the leſs three handfuls: Roſes four pugils: the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine of a Boy two pints.

                     <p>Finally, when al Medicines fail, when the Diſeaſe is almoſt deſperate, it were good to try an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience with the Oyntment of Quickſilver; which <hi>Fonſeca</hi> ſaith was his invention, yet ſeldom uſed; for in his 19. <hi>Conſultat. lib.</hi> 1. he thus ſaith: <hi>I have thought ſometimes that the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction uſed for the Cure of the French Pox, hath power to take away Cataracts in their beginning and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe; by the ſame reaſon that it takes away the Humors remaining in the Eyes from the French Pox; for by it the Head may be ſo Purged, that a Cataract may be Cured; and I have determined to make tryal of it. Fonſeca</hi> had much commended his Judgment if he had ſeen <hi>Skenkius</hi> his Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, 309. Lib. 1. which is taken out of the 5. Book of <hi>Alexander Trajanus Petronus,</hi> of the French Pox, <hi>Cap. 1. One</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>before he had the French Pox was blind of one Eye with a Cataract or thick Suffuſion; by the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction with Quick-ſilver was freed wonderfully from his Pox and Cataract both at once: Neither is it without reaſon that Cataracts may be diſſolved with that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction, when we ſee by Experience that very hard Tumors of thick and groſs Flegm are po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfully diſſolved by the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction of Quick-ſilver.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When a Cataract can be diſſolved with no other Medicines, the laſt Remedy is the Chirurgical Operation, which with a Needle put into the Eye, after the matter of the Cataract being thick, and turned to a little skin, thruſteth it to the lower part of the Eye, ſo that the ſight is reſtored as if a window were opened. This Operation is ſucceſsful ſometimes; but often not: But when the caſe is ſo that no hope remains of other wayes, it is better according to the Opinion of <hi>Celſus,</hi> formerly Commended, to try an uncertain Medicine than none: But it uſeth not to be tryed by reaſon of its uncertainty by ordinary Chirurgions; but of Quackſalvers, who go to and fro practiſing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time and manner of the Operation is to be left only to them.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe thoſe things ought not to be hid from a Phyſitian, you may find them exactly treated on in divers Practical Authors, when the Cataract is Cured.</p>
                     <p>Whether it be with diſſolving Medicines or manual Operation you muſt uſe a courſe of Phyſick long after, becauſe there is a great fear of a Relapſe. For the Eyes having been much weakned by a long Diſeaſe, are very ready to receive any Defluxion again from the brain. Therefore you muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the uſual Purging; you muſt have Iſſues continually for diverſion; and uſe often ſtrengtheners of the Eyes, ſuch as are preſcribed in <hi>Gutta ſerena:</hi> to which you may ad a waſhing of the Eyes, which muſt be done every day thus:</p>
                     <p>In the morning firſt chew ſweet Fennel ſeeds ſome ſpace of time, then fill the mouth with Wine, and after it is warm in the mouth, waſh the Eyes therewith till they begin to ſmart, which wil ceaſe when you leave waſhing.</p>
                     <p>Moreover Spectacles are very good to preſerve ſight which do make the Objects neither bigger nor leſs than they naturally are. And it is profitable to refreſh the ſight with green or sky coloured Spectales.</p>
                     <p>And Laſtly, You muſt avoid al things which hurt the ſight, and uſe thoſe things which help it, as is declared in the Diet for the Cure of <hi>Gutta ſerena.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of the Enlarging, or Dilatation of the <hi>Pupilla.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THe Tunicle called <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vea,</hi> out of <hi>Galen, 1. de ſympt. cauſ. cap.</hi> 2. is obnoxious to divers diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and eſpecially to Ruption, Diſtortion, Dilatation, and Conſtriction.</p>
                     <p>A Ruption may come both of an external Cauſe, as ſtroak or contuſion; and of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, when much humor diſtendeth and breaketh the Tunicle: But this being incurable concerneth not us.</p>
                     <p>A Diſtortion of the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vea</hi> cannot be but in the firſt conſtitution of it, becauſe it adhaereth to the <hi>Cornea.</hi> Therefore <hi>Galen</hi> in the place quoted doth only reckon it among the different ſymptomes of the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vea:</hi> and doth not ſtand to explain it, becauſe it is of no concernment in the practice of Phyſick. We therefore omitting the firſt two differences, wil only inſiſt upon the explaining of the Dilatation, and conſtriction of the Pupilla.</p>
                     <p>The Dilatation of the Pupilla, which is a hole in the Uvea Tunicle, by which the Species of Objects paſs into the Eye, is called in Greek <hi>Mydryaſis;</hi> this hurts the ſight becauſe too much light goeth into the Eye; hence it is that they which have this diſeaſe, ſee better in a darkiſh place than in a light. Which appears by Natural and ordinary change in the Pupilla in bright and obſcure places; for when the Sight is exerciſed in a cleer light place, the Pupilla is contracted that the light may go leſs into the Eye, and not hurt it with too much, by diſſipating and diſperſing the Spirits; and hence it is that they which go out of a very light place into a dark, ſee almoſt nothing at their firſt entry: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Pupilla being formerly contracted, doth not in an obſcure place receive light enough to make a perfect Sight. After, when they have continued a while in an obſcure place, the Pupilla is by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees dilated, to receive more light, for the cleering of Sight, and then thoſe things which at firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance were not ſeen, are cleerly perceived. On the contrary, they which go out of a dark, into a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry light place, cannot at firſt endure the light, and their Eyes are much dazled, becauſe the Pupilla being much dilated before in the dark place for to get light enough into the Eye, when it comes ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly thus enlarged into a great light, too much light gets into the Eye, and ſo makes it dazle and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbs the Sight. Whence it appears, that light neceſſary to ſight ought to paſs into the Eye in a moderate quantity, and for the receiving thereof, it is neceſſary that the Pupilla be moderately large.</p>
                     <p>Now the Preternatural Dilation of the Pupilla is either in the firſt original, which is not to be tampered with; or comes of Preternatural cauſes which are internal or external.</p>
                     <p>The neareſt and immediate of the internal cauſes, is the ſtretching of the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vea,</hi> which comes ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of drineſs or repletion.</p>
                     <p>Drineſs doth ſtretch the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vea,</hi> and makes the form of the Pupilla larger, as when leather pierced through, when it is dried hath the hole larger: And this dry diſtemper comes from long watching, Feavers, and other drying cauſes.</p>
                     <p>The repletion of the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vea</hi> when it diſtendeth it on every ſide, makes the Pupilla larger, and this is produced either of vapors, and wind ſent into the Eye, or of humors flowing thither, or from the extraordinary encreaſe of the watery humor of the Eye, or laſtly from the ſwelling of the Tunicle Uvea it ſelf. To theſe Cauſes we may ad, the Convulſion of the Uvea, which appeareth chiefly in Epileptical fits; for then all the Nervous and Membranous parts are diſtended, and ſo is alſo the Uvea; and this appears chiefly moſt manifeſt in Epileptick Children, in whom the dilation of the Pupilla is ſo great, that it is over all the Circle called <hi>Iris,</hi> and therefore the ſight is aboliſhed.</p>
                     <p>The internal Cauſes are, a ſtroak, or a fall, or a retention of the Spirits, as in Women in Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth, and Trumpeters. A ſtroak or fall make a defluxion to the Eyes, hence comes extending of the Pupilla: retention of Spirits makes wind and humors, from whence comes diſtention.</p>
                     <p>The knowledg of this Diſeaſe is not difficult, becauſe it may be ſeen with your Eyes, eſpecially if the Phyſitian knew before it became infirm how large naturally the Pupilla was; as alſo if there be a hinderance of the ſight by reaſon of the over largeneſs of it.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, The natural largeneſs of the Pupilla is known by this, If when you ſhut one Eye, the Pupilla of the other is larger, which will not be in a Preternatural dilatation, becauſe then the Uvea cannot be further extended.</p>

                     <p>As to the Prognoſtick, The Dilatation of the Pupilla from the original ſo, is incurable; but that which cometh after is hardly cured, eſpecially that which comes of drineſs, but that which comes of other

                     <p>The Cure is to be varied according to the variety of the Cauſe; and if it come from drineſs, which can ſcarce come from an internal cauſe, but alſo the whol Body muſt be ſo afflicted; therefore we muſt refreſh the whol body with moiſt Remedies, and nouriſhments, and ſuch as are reſtaurative, ſuch we uſe in Hectick Feavers: but more peculiarly the Body is to be moiſtened with a bath of warm wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and new milk, which alſo muſt be often put into the Eyes, eſpecially womans Milk.</p>
                     <p>If it comes from a humor which filleth the Eye, becauſe it floweth from the Head you muſt purge the Head and the whol Body alſo, and then you muſt diſcuſs the humor that is fixed in the Eye. Which when they may be ſufficiently performed by the Remedies propounded for the cure of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taract or Suffuſion, we ſhall not in vain repeat them here, but ſend you to the aſoreſaid Trearite for them, where you ſhall find all things neceſſary for the diſcuſſing and diſſipating humors contained in the Eyes. Yet you may after uſe ſome aſtringents which may make the Pupilla which is too much enlarged more narrow: for this end you may make uſe of this following Collyrium, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Take of <hi>red Roſes dried two ſcruples: Saffron, Spicknard, the Bark of the Frankinſence Tree, of each half a ſcruple: Tutty prepared, burnt lvory, and Acacia, of each one ſcruple: Bring them into a Pouder, and put them in a thin linnen cloth, and tie it; then hang it in three ounces of Roſe Water, and waſh the Eyes often with the Water, dropping into them, ſqueezing the cloth as often as you uſe the Water.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If it comes from wind (after univerſal Evacuations) thoſe Medicines are to be uſed which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs wind in the whol Body, and eſpecially in the Eyes, and ſo they may be fomented with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Fennel, Rue, Dill, red Roſes, Myrtles, made in Roſe Water with the fourth part of white Wine.</p>
                     <p>Finally, If it come with a ſtroak, you muſt alter the manner of Cure, according to the greatneſs of the Contuſion; and if there be an Inflamation, you muſt cure it as an Opfithalmy: But if there be no Inflamation, you ſhall at the firſt apply a Cataplaſm of Bean flower, Plantane Leaves, and red Roſes made up with Roſe Water. After that, you ſhall often drop therein the blood of a Pid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, which is a moſt excellent Remedy in all Wounds and Contuſions of the Eyes.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of the ſtraitneſs, or Contraction of the <hi>Pupilla.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THe Pupilla being too ſtraight, hindereth the ſight, as the being of it too large, as was ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the former Chapter, becauſe a moderate largeneſs of the Pupilla is neceſſary for recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving perfectly the viſible Species. So when the Eye is in its Natural condition, and is in a light place, the Pupilla is contracted leſt it ſhould take in too much light, if ſuddenly it be in a dark room, the things therein contained are little or ſcarcely ſeen at the firſt entrance, by reaſon of the aforeſaid contraction. Afterwards when the Pupil is dilated, al things are ſeen rightly, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in a place moderately light, the breadth of the Pupilla ought to be moderate, that it may receive moderate light, not too much, nor too little, for making a perfect ſight. But if the Pupilla be too narrow, it receiveth not light enough, therefore they who are ſo affected, the ſight is diminiſhed, yet they ſee well in a very light place, becauſe at that time light ſufficient will paſs through a narrow hole, if no other Diſeaſe of the Eyes be joyned with it.</p>
                     <p>Now the narrowneſs of the Pupilla, cometh either from the original, or firſt conſtitution, and then it little hindereth; for if they who are ſo affected ſee leſs in a dark or dusky place than they who have a Pupilla of its moderate natural breath, yet in a clear light place they ſee better. Hence <hi>Galen</hi> ſaid in 1. <hi>de ſymp. cauſ. cap.</hi> 2. that they who are born with ſmal Pupilla's ſee beſt.</p>
                     <p>Or the ſtraightneſs of the Pupilla comes from preternatural cauſes, namely, overmuch moiſture, drineſs, or defect of the Watery Humor, and want of Spirits.</p>
                     <p>The Pupil is contracted by humidity, when the Uvea is relaxed, and ſo makes the hole leſs or nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower: For although the dilatation of the Pupilla come of the ſame humidity, yet contrary effects come not of the ſame cauſe, becauſe if the cauſe may be called the ſame, it ought to have the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </gap>ation to its effects, but humidity is not in the ſame manner when it makes a Dilatation, for it makes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Concerning dryneſs there is the ſame difficulty, ſince it is mentioned among the cauſes of dilating <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he Pupilla. But this is the difference: When the Uvea is dryed, and the humors of the Eye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49088:50"/>
in their due quantity, then it makes a dilatation of the Pupilla, becauſe it looſeth not the extention which it formerly had, as was ſaid in the precedent Chapter, concerning Skins extended when dryed, make their holes larger; but if the Tunicle Uvea when it is dryed, wrinckled, falls to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and looſe its former extenſion, from the defect or diminiſhing of the humors of the eye, then is the hole of the Pupilla made ſtraighter.</p>
                     <p>And ſo the conſtriction of the Pupilla by drineſs wil be almoſt the ſame with that which happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from a defect of the watery humor in the eye; although it may come without drineſs, when by the powring forth of the watery humor the Uvea falls down.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, ſhe narrowneſs of the Pupilla comes from the defect of Spirits, or from the fewneſs of them, when by reaſon of the obſtruction of the optick Nerve or ſome other cauſe, the viſive ſpirit cannot come to the eyes, which when it is filled with ſpirit keeps its Tunicles extended; but when it wanteth ſpirits they grow lax and fal together: Hence the conſtriction of the Pupilla uſually co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth. This appeareth in very Old men, in whom the Pupilla is made narrow by reaſon of the want of ſpirits.</p>
                     <p>This Diſeaſe is known eaſily being open to the ſenſe, for if one eye alone ſuffer, by comparing it with the other you may perceive the ſtraightneſs of the Pupilla; but if both ſuffer, by looking upon the eyes of another man who is ſound ſighted, you find it out.</p>
                     <p>As to the Prognoſtick, a ſtraightneſs in the Pupilla which cometh from the loſs of the watery hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor in the eye, is incurable, becauſe when that is once loſt it cannot be recruited; eſpecially in old folk: in yong people ſomtimes the watery humor of the eye hath been let forth by a wound, and hath been repaired again: A Conſtriction of the Pupilla from drineſs, can ſcarſe, and very hardly be cured: But that which comes from moiſture, in the beginning, and being yong, may be eaſily Cured: but an old one very hardly.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of this Diſeaſe differeth not from the former, for they come both from the ſame Cauſes, namely, Drineſs, or Moiſture; which diſtempers, although they produce contrary effects, after the manner before Explained; yet are they to be Cured by the ſame Remedies.</p>

                     <p>THe Natural Conſtitution of the Cornea Tunicle is deſtroyed when it looſeth its brightneſs and tranſparentneſs; or when its infected with another colour.</p>
                     <p>It looſeth brightneſs when it is grown thicker; now the Cornea doth grow thick by drineſs, as in old men, which is incurable; or by groſs humors faſtened upon it, which happeneth often in an Oph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalmy; when either by too much uſe of Reſolving Medicines the thinner parts of the humor are diſſolved, and the thick remain: Or when by an extraordinary uſe of cold Medicines the humors are thickned: and the Cornea doth not only become thicker in that part unto which the humor is faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but it alſo contracteth a white Colour, which is called Leucoma, or Albugo; ſomtimes this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo comes from a ſcar after an Ulcer, whereby the Cornea is made thicker in that part, and looſeth its tranſparentneſs.</p>
                     <p>The Differences are divers, as they are more or leſsthick; one doth poſſeſs only the ſuperficies of the Cornea: another lies more deep, and pierceth the whol Cornea: another is greater, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth the whol Pupilla, or the greateſt part thereof: another is leſs, and comprehendeth but a little ſpace of the Pupilla, and then it is properly called Macula, or Pin and Web.</p>
                     <p>The Cornea is altered in Colour when it is blood-ſhot, which Diſeaſe is called Sugillatio, and then al Objects appear red: Or when Choller is got into it, as in thoſe who have the yellow Jaundice; and then the Objects uſe to appear yellow according to <hi>Galens</hi> Doctrine, which is to be underſtood of a great effuſion of Choller upon the Cornea, for if it be only lightly died therewith, which often happeneth (for the Tunicle Adnata receiveth more Choller than the Cornea) then the Objects wil not ſeem yellow, but as they naturally are.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Diſeaſes need their peculiar Diagnoſis for the knowledge of them; becauſe they are appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to the Senſes, but eſpecially Albugo, which is thicker and more white; and more hindereth the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ght: So alſo that which is more ſuperficial is more white; but that which is deeper declineth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to black becauſe it is neerer to the Uvea, which being its ſelf black, communicates its Colour unto that.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes which produce theſe, are eaſily known by what hath been ſaid; namely, if an Oph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalmy,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49088:50"/>
or Wound, or Ulcer went before.</p>
                     <p>As to the Prognoſtick: An Albugo which comes of Flegm, or a thick humor remaining after an Ophthalmy, it is eaſily Cured, eſpecially if it be not inveterate: but that which cometh after a Wound or Ulcer, and is a ſcar, is very hardly cured; becauſe in a part which hath exquiſite ſenſe, ſharp Medicines, ſuch as are proper to wear away a Cicatrize or Scar, c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The Cure of an <hi>Albugo</hi> congealed or gathered in the Cornea from Flegm, is done by Emolients attenuating and diſcuſſing Medicines, but by alwayes uſing univerſal Medicines firſt, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ch may take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the antecedent Cauſe, and hinder a new defluxion from the eyes, which would be cauſed by Medicines to the place; eſpecially if they be ſharp, or hot, except the matter be firſt remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                     <p>Therefore firſt make univerſal Evacuations, then revulſions, then Derivations, as it is ſet down in the Cure of <hi>Gutta ſerena,</hi> and <hi>Cataract.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Afterwards apply a Fomentation to ſoften the hard matter (with ſoft ſpunges) made of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Foenugreek, Melilot, Celondine, and Fennel.</p>
                     <p>Or, Let the Vapor of it be taken into the eyes; and to this purpoſe you may make this that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Marſh-mallow Roots one ounce: the Leaves of Mallows, Eyebright, Celondine the great, of each one handful: Linſeed and Foenugreek of each three drams: Melilot flowers one pugil: make a Decoction of theſe in springwater, and let the ſteem or vapor of it be taken into the Eyes, morning and evening.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Afterwards uſe Diſcuſſives, ſuch as are preſcribed in the Cure of a Cataract or Suffuſion; for they alſo wil do wel here. And ſo <hi>Collyria</hi> Eye waters which do attenuate and reſolve the Humor faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the eye, may be taken from thence, and eſpecially thoſe which are made of Honey and things that quicken the ſight. For the Water of Honey diſtilled uſed alone, is very good to take away al blemiſhes in the Eye if you continue the uſe of it any time.</p>
                     <p>Sugar Candy is good for the ſame, Diſſolved in the Water of Eyebright, Celondine, or Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel.</p>
                     <p>As alſo it would be very good to let a Child that hath chewed Fennel-Seed to lick the Eye of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Amatus Luſitanus</hi> reports that he Cured thick clouds in the Eye of a Girle of twelve yeers of age after he had given the Decoction of Sarſa twenty dayes, with this Medicine.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Honey from the Hive two pints: the tops of Fennel, the flowers of Elder and Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bright, of each two pugils: Sugar Candy four ounces: diſtil them in Balneo Mariae; and let the water be dropped into the Eyes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Seed of Clary put into the Eye at bed time, purgeth the Eye from Filth, and fo clenſeth it, that it conduceth to the Cure of <hi>Albugo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The juyce of Fennel doth potently diſcuſs an <hi>Albugo</hi> if newly made, and mixed with a drop of the Balſom of Peru.</p>
                     <p>The ſame doth an Oyl made of burnt Rags mixed with the ſpittle of Child, and laid on with a Feather: It is made by burning of a Linnen Rag, and quenching it betwen two diſhes; when it is cold you ſhal find the Oyl in drops upon the diſh.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Albugo</hi> coming of a Scar, is cured with Remedies that are good to mollifie, attenuate, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve Scars; but ſince ſuch are alwaies ſharp, you muſt be more careful in applying, firſt univerſal Medicines, and revulſives, leſt a flux of humors be brought to the part. Having therfore uſed them as aforeſaid, firſt it is good to apply emollient Fomentations or Fumigations above preſcribed. Then uſe abſtergent &amp; diſcuſſing Remedies: Firſt thoſe that are gentle, ſuch as are above mentioned, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the compound Water of Honey: After you may come to ſtronger, ſuch as are the Galls of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, of the Uranoſcopus, or one-eyed Fiſh; of the Paſtinaca, or fiſh like the Ray; or of the Pike; as alſo of other Creatures, as of a Partridg, Cock, Gooſe, Ox, and others. After the ſame manner may be uſed the juyce of great Celondine, of the leſſer Centaury, of Brooklime, and the like, which muſt be mixed with Honey both becauſe Honey hath a clenſing and diſcuſſing quality, as alſo becauſe Liquors that are put into the Eye, flow to the corners, and ſtay not in the Pupilla in which their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is required; but being thickened with Honey, they cleave wel to the Eye: But if their ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs cannot be endured, the ſaid Juyces or Galls may be thickened, with that Mucilage or ſlime of Gum Traganth, of Fleabane, or of Quinces, being drawn with the Water of Fennel, Eye-bright, or other proper to the Eyes.</p>
                     <p>The form of a Collyrium made of Juyces, is thus:</p>

in the Ophthalmia, is very good.</hi> Or this,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Aloes and Agarick, of each one ſcruple: Pouder them, and tie them in a clout; which ſteep in the Water of Eyebright or Fennel, and wipe the Eyes therewith morning and evening. Aloes doth clenſe, ſtrengthen, and ſtop the defluxion; Agarick doth powerfully clenſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sugillatio</hi> or blood-ſhot, or that red color in the Eye which cometh of blood ſent thither, if it be yong, is eaſily cured with Pidgeons blood dropped in: but in the want thereof you may uſe Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Milk with a little Frankinſence and Saffron. Or you may apply the Yolk of an Egg with Wine; which is commended of <hi>Galen, 4. de comp. Med. ſec. loc. cap.</hi> 8. But if the diſeaſe be ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, you muſt foment the Eye with the Decoction of Foenugreek, Marſh-mallows, Fennel, Rue, Celondine; or let the fume of the ſame be received into it. And finally, all Medicines preſcribed in the Cure of a Cataract may be very proper for the cure of this. But more eſpecially, when the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is old, and the redneſs turneth black, <hi>Galen</hi> commends dried Hyſop tied in a rag, and put into hot water, and applied to the Eye: and Experience teacheth that this Medicine is of ſuch force that the blood is drawn away by it ſticking to the clout.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly, The yellow color of the Jaundice, which moſt appears in the Eyes, when the Jaundice is cured is eaſily diſcuſſed: if you would haſten the Cure, take the fume of Vinegar into the Eyes.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of <hi>Ophthalmia,</hi> or Inflamation of the Eyes.</head>
                     <p>THe Tunicle called <hi>Adnata</hi> is ſo joyn'd to the <hi>Cornea,</hi> that many diſeaſes are in both; as the Inflamation of the Eyes, though it is proper to the <hi>Adnata,</hi> yet it is often extended to the <hi>Cornea,</hi> and produceth divers Diſeaſes in it, namely, Ulcers, <hi>Hypopyon,</hi> when matter is underneath, <hi>Albugo</hi> or Pin and Web, and others. So alſo Puſtals, and other Tumors, Wounds, and Ulcers are common to both Tunicles. Therefore becauſe all the Diſeaſes of theſe Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles cannot be ſpoken of ſeverally, we will only ſpeak of the Diſeaſes of the <hi>Adnata</hi> before we ſpeak more of the <hi>Cornea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beginning with an Ophthalmy; We ſay that it is, as the word in Greek ſheweth, only an Infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Eye, and by all Authors it is uſed for the inflamation of the Adnata, or Conjunctiva. It is called by the Latines <hi>Lippitudo</hi> or blood-ſhotneſs ſince <hi>Cornelius Celſus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Inflamation, as it is greater or leſs, hath a three-fold difference. The firſt is called in Greek <hi>Taraxis,</hi> in Latin <hi>Conturbatio,</hi> which according to <hi>Paulus</hi> cometh from an external cauſe, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Sun, ſmoak, duſt, oyl, and the like: but it may alſo come of an internal, namely, by fault of the ſtomach after drinking of Wine, or other Diſtempers; and this is a light Inflamation called <hi>Phlogoſis,</hi> with a ſmal pain and redneſs, yet it ſomtimes turneth into a true Ophthalmy, and is the original of it.</p>
                     <p>But a true Ophthalmy comes alwaies from an internal cauſe, and it is a true inflamation with which tumor, redneſs, and pain, it is called by <hi>Celſus, Lippitudo</hi> or blood-ſhotneſs, becauſe there cleaveth a thick excrement, which the Latins call <hi>Lippa.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third is called <hi>Chemoſis</hi> in Greek; in Latin <hi>Chemoſis</hi> alſo, and it is when an inflamation groweth ſo high that it is very great with vehement pain, and both the Eyebrows are inverted ſo, that the Eyes can ſcarce be covered therewith; and the white of the Eye ſtands higher, and the red doth cover moſt part of the Iris or Circle. In Children, and ſuch as have great Eyes, this hath often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, and it comes from a great repletion, and from flegmy humors.</p>
                     <p>There is another Difference of the Ophthalmy taken out of <hi>Hippocrates, Aph. 14. Sect.</hi> 3. by which it is divided unto a moiſt and a dry Ophthalmy: The moiſt Ophthalmy is that which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready deſcribed, and hath a weeping. But the dry Ophthalmy called by <hi>Hippocrates, Xerophthal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> which cometh in dry weather, is made of Choller, or burnt or aduſt Melancholly, and is ſuch as wanteth humidity in part, and therefore there is no weeping. There are other ſubdiviſions from the adjuncts; for if there be an itching joyned with it, it is called <hi>Pſorophthalmia;</hi> but if it come with hardneſs of the Eye-lids, it is called <hi>Sclerophthalmia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is alſo another Difference of Ophthalmies, taken out of <hi>Galen, 2. de diff. febrium, cap.</hi> 11. where he ſaith That ſome are Periodical, or ſuch as cometh by fits, to thoſe which have a very hot and moiſt head, and weak Eyes, fit to receive a defluxion. Theſe after many yeers have a conſumption of their Eyes, and loſe their ſight; hence it is called <hi>Tabida Ophthalmia,</hi> or a conſuming Ophthal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, or an Ophthalmy which ends in a conſumption of the Eye.</p>
                     <p>There is alſo another difference taken from the immediate cauſe, which is defluxion or congeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb facs="tcp:49088:51"/>
                        <pb facs="tcp:49088:52"/>
                        <pb n="79" facs="tcp:49088:52"/>
that is, gathering of humors. It comes for the moſt part by defluxion; but by congeſtion only, when there is either a diſtemper or weakneſs of the Conjunctiva, by which there is no equality, or <hi>Omoioſis</hi> in the part, but many excrements are gathered together, from whence through the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the part cometh an inflamation.</p>
                     <p>The Conjunct cauſe of an Odhthalmy is Chollerick, or Wateriſh, or Melanchollick Blood flowing into the Eyes, or gathered into them. The Cauſes of defluxion are manifold, both external and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ordinarily known. But the cauſes of Congeſtion or Cumulation are all ſuch as diſtemper or weaken the Eyes; ſo that an Ophthalmy which at the firſt came only by defluxion, in time by wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening of the part may ſpoil its concoction, and ſo it may be ſaid to be an Ophthalmy partly from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxion, and partly from Congeſtion, which is often ſeen in old Ophthalmies.</p>
                     <p>But when an Ophthalmy comes only by way of defluxion, it is certain that it comes for the moſt part from the head, and almoſt all Authors acknowledg this. Notwithſtanding Experience teacheth that many violent Ophthalmies come from the Liver, and the humors that come from thence to the Eyes; inſomuch that Cauteries applied to the hinder part of the head, e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>creaſe the Diſeaſe, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe are good Remedies when the defluxion is from the head, for they draw up the humors: and we have often ſeen that old Ophthalmies which were accounted incurable, have ſuddenly gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of their own accord, by ſtopping of an iſſue which hath long been kept open, namely, when the motion of the humors from the inferior to the ſuperior parts hath ceaſed, which before was cauſed by the Cautery or Iſſue in the Neck, by Nature ſending part of the humors to the weakened Eyes, not far diſtant from the Iſſue.</p>
                     <p>That defluxion which cometh from the head, either is carried by internal Veins, which are under the Skull, into the Eyes; or by the external Veſſels, which is moſt frequent, namely, by the Veins, and Arteries which come from the Pericranium by the Forehead and Temples, to the Conjunctiva.</p>
                     <p>An Ophthalmy is eaſily known, becauſe the blood diffuſed upon the Conjunctiva may be eaſily ſeen, and if redneſs appear without a tumor coming of an external, it is called <hi>Taraxis,</hi> or Conturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But if beſides the redneſs there be ſwelling and heat with weeping, it is a true Ophthalmy, and at length if it ſo encreaſe that it cover the black of the Eye, and the Eyelids be inverted, then is it cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Chemoſis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence we fetch the ſigns of the Cauſes: for if it comes from repletion, and of blood alone, not only the Tunicle Adnata, but alſo the whol face will be red; as alſo there will be a ſwelling of the Veins, drouzineſs of the Sences and whol Body, and a manifeſt ſwelling.</p>
                     <p>If it come from Chollerick Blood, there will be ſharpneſs of tears, and not only the corners of the Eyes, but alſo the very cheeks will be corroded, there will be a pricking and intollerable pain, a little ſwelling with redneſs inclined to yellow; and the patient hath formerly uſed immoderate exerciſe been inflamed by the Sun, ſubject to anger, and eating of ſharp things, his complexion is Chollerick, or he is yong, and the diſeaſe cometh in hot weather.</p>
                     <p>If it come from flegm, there will be a heavy pain, little heat, not much redneſs, little ſhooting, no ſharp tears, but many, and ſlimy and glutinatious.</p>
                     <p>If it come of Melancholly, the Tumor will be ſmal, the redneſs will be dusky, few tears, little clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineſs, but very thick, a Melanchollick conſtitution, and the like ſigns of Melancholly.</p>
                     <p>If the defluxion come from the inner parts of the Head, there will be a pain in the Head internally coming to the Roots of the Eyes. But if the defluxion come into the Eyes by the exterior Veſſels, the pain of the Head will be more external, the Veins of the Forehead will be diſtended, and alſo there will be perceived a great beating in the Temples.</p>
                     <p>The Prognoſtick is either in reſpect of an Ophthalmy coming, or already begun.</p>
                     <p>An imminent <hi>Lippitudo</hi> is known by an itching and pricking in the Eyes, with heat alſo, and the diſpoſition of the Eyes to receive defluxions, doth give advantage to the prognoſtick of it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they who have great Eyes are more ſubject to this diſeaſe: Moreover, the ſeaſon doth much conduce to the breeding of it, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> teacheth, Aph. 11. Sect. 3. If the Winter be dry and full of North winds, and the Spring rainy, and with South winds, in Summer you ſhall have ſore Eyes very common, eſpecially in women, and men of moiſt conſtitutions.</p>
                     <p>A flux of the Belly coming upon an Ophthalmy is good, according to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> Aph. 17. Sect. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>6. becauſe the ſuperfluity of humors is diſcharged, and carried downwards.</p>
                     <p>An old pain in the Eyes is very dangerous, for it ſignifies the cauſe to be violent, and it is to be feared leſt Impoſthume, Suppuration, or Ulcer do follow.</p>
                     <p>An Ophthalmy beginning in one Eye uſeth ordinarily to paſs to the other.</p>
                     <p>For the Cure of an Ophthalmy, the external cauſes muſt be firſt removed, as alſo the antecedent cauſes are to be evacuated, revelled, and repelled; the conjunct cauſe is to be derived and diſcuſſed, and the part affected ſtrengthened. For the performing of which Indications there are theſe uſual means to be applied.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Let his Diet be cooling and moiſtening, of Meats that breed good nouriſhment, boyled ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

than roaſted; of ſuppings rather than ſolid things; becauſe the Eyes are moved in chewing: let him avoid ſharp things, Salt and Pepper. As alſo things that Fume, and wil fill the Head with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors: As alſo ſuch as quickly turn into Choller, as Milk, Sugar, Honey, and al ſweet things; Wine eſpecially is not good; but inſtead thereof uſe Barly water, with Liquoris and cooling things.</p>
                     <p>Sleep is very profitable, becauſe then the Eyes reſt from motion which is apt to ſtir up pain and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxion; beſides pain is aſſwaged by ſleep, and the matter cauſing the Diſeaſe is concocted: Let the Patient ſleep with his Head high, and more inclined to that ſide which is leaſt affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
                     <p>Let him avoid almotion of his Body, for reſt is ſo profitable that <hi>Celſus</hi> commands that the firſt day of Cure they ſpeak not, leſt by that motion matter be carried to the head.</p>
                     <p>The Belly muſt be kept Solluble, for <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith it is good for him that hath ſore eyes to fal into a looſeneſs.</p>
                     <p>Let him avoid Paſſions, eſpecially Anger.</p>
                     <p>Let the Air be temperate and pure, without Smoak, Duſt, and Winds, and ſomwhat dark; of the light by moving the Spirits cauſeth defluxion: Let him have a black, green, or sky colored cloth before his eyes; and keep not only his ſore but his ſound eye ſhut or covered; for while the ſound eye is moved towards the Objects the ſore is moved alſo, whence the pain encreaſeth; and this is the reaſon why men have greater pain when one eye is affected, than when both.</p>
                     <p>The Diet being thus ordered, let us lay down the Cure of the Diſeaſe; and ſince it comes for the moſt part of external Cauſes: firſt let them be removed leſt they nouriſh it: next make a <hi>Collyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> or Eye-water, or Roſe and Plantane Water, with the white of an egg, and Womans milk, and let that be inſtilled into the Eye often in a day; as alſo let a linnen clout be dipped therein and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.</p>
                     <p>At the ſame time let him ſleep as much as he can; for ſleep is very profitable to concoct and diſcuſs the matter cauſing the Diſeaſe. If it yield not to theſe, you muſt uſe the Remedies proper for a true <hi>Ophthalmy,</hi> in this Order.</p>
                     <p>Firſt open a Vein (having given a Clyſter) on the contrary Arm, and do it often, till you have made ſufficient Evacuation and Revulſion: For <hi>Avicen</hi> teacheth, That in a true <hi>Ophthalmy</hi> you may let blood till they faint. But <hi>Galen, lib. de curat. per ſangu. miſſ. cap.</hi> 17. tells a ſtory of a Steward which was freed of a great <hi>Ophthalmy</hi> by blood letting: firſt three pound; and four hours after one pound: And in his 16. <hi>cap.</hi> of the ſame Book he affirmeth, That <hi>Ophthalmies</hi> are often cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in an hours ſpace only by Phlebotomy: which could not be but by looſing of a great quantity, as they did in thoſe times in that caſe.</p>
                     <p>Phlebotomy muſt be regulated and moderated according to the temper, age, ſex, ſtrength, and kind of the Diſeaſe; for in a Plethorick body, and when it comes from blood, you muſt take a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter quantity: but in a Chollerick body, or Melancholly, or Flegmatick, and other Circumſtances which prohibit blood-letting, you muſt take leſs.</p>
                     <p>If the whol body be ful of blood, firſt open the Liver or <hi>Median</hi> vein, after the Head vein; but if you intend to looſe but little blood, begin with the Head vein.</p>
                     <p>But in them who have a ſtoppage of any ordinary accuſtomed Evacuation by the Terms or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhoids, you muſt open the veins beneath, or apply Leeches to the Hemorrhoid veins.</p>
                     <p>After you have bled enough, you muſt labor to make Revulſion by applying of Cupping glaſſes to the ſhoulders and the back, both dry and with ſcarrification.</p>
                     <p>Frictions alſo are good for the ſame; and Ligatures in the lower parts.</p>
                     <p>To the aforeſaid Revulſions you muſt ad means to derive, which are by the opening of the veins of the Forehead and Temples; to which ſome ad the opening of the veins in the corners of the Eyes: others apply Horſleeches to the Temples, others behind the Ears; al which derivations are very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable after ſufficient Evacuation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Galen</hi> 13. Meth. Cap. 22. Commended the opening of an Artery in the Temples, when the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe comes of very hot blood: And though this way of Practice is not uſed in our times, yet it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry excellent and profitable, without any danger; for in thoſe leſſer Arteries the blood is ſtanched by good Ligature and bondage only; nor is the Plaiſter mentioned by <hi>Galen</hi> in the ſame place neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which is made of Bole, Frankinſence, Maſtick, and the Hair of an Hare, with the white of an Egg: yet for the better ſecurity, they who are afraid of the opening of an Artery, may make uſe of it; you may ſee what we have ſaid concerning the opening of Arteries in the Cure of the Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach.</p>
                     <p>Veſicatories alſo are very profitable in this Diſeaſe, both applied to the Neck and behind the Ears.</p>
                     <p>When you have bled ſufficiently you muſt purge, that the Chollerick Humors, eſpecially ſuch as make the blood hot, may be evacuated: And <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith it is very requiſite, Aphor. 17.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:49088:53"/>
                        <hi>Sect. 6. For it is good for him that hath an Ophthalmy to fall into a flux.</hi> And <hi>Galen, 13. Meth. Cap.</hi> 11. ſaith, <hi>That he hath ſeen ſome who began to have ſore Eyes to be cured in one day only by a Purge.</hi> But it muſt be made of gentle ingredients, and ſuch as do allay the heat of the blood, taking heed of al Medicines that have Scammony in them, and they be made thus.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Tamarinds half an ounce: clean Senna three drams: Annisſeeds half a dram: En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dive, Succory, and Fumatory, of each half a handful: boyl them to four ounces; and when it is ſtrained infuſe in the liquor of the beſt Rhubarb and yellow Myrobalans rubbed with the Oyl of ſweet Almonds, of each one dram: yellow Saunders half a ſcruple: after ſtrain it again, and diſſolve of Manna and ſyrup of Roſes of each one ounce. Make a Potion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or in Form of <hi>Bolus,</hi> thus.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Caſſia newly drawn ſix drams: Diacatholicon three drams: Pouder of Rhubarb one dram: make a</hi> Bolus <hi>with Sugar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So many times we preſcribe Pills in an Ophthalmy which comes of Flegm, namely, Lucis majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, of Agarick, and the like: which though they are very good in the ſtate of the Diſeaſe, yet it is better to abſtain from in the beginning, leſt the Humors moved with too violent a Medicine ſhould fal more upon the part.</p>
                     <p>Nor is one Purge ſufficient, but you muſt repel it a diſtance, if the Diſeaſe be old; firſt giving good preparatives by Apozemes or Juleps proper for the Humor offending: therefore in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning allay the heat of the Humors with cooling Juleps, and ſuch as thicken; or with Emulſions made of the greater Cold Seeds, Lettice and white Poppy ſeeds, in ſome cooling Decoction, with a little Roſe water.</p>
                     <p>After univerſal Revulſions and Evacuations come to Topical Medicines with that part, which from the beginning muſt be repelling; yet the ſoundeſt Practicioners do warn us not to uſe repelling Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines to the Eyes at firſt, becauſe for the moſt part they ſtop the Humor and retain it in the Eye, and ſo increaſe the grief and inflamation: For <hi>Galen</hi> Comment. Aphor. 31. Sect. 6. reproves a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Oculiſt which uſed theſe kind of Medicines in the beginning of the inflamation; for they may be ſuſpected in the beginning not to ſtay violent defluxions, but rather to keep them from coming forth: Hence it cometh to paſs that when the humors are ſharp the Cornea is ſomtimes ulcerated, but when they are many it is ſtreaked and ſomtimes broken: But <hi>Avicenna, fen. 3. lib. 3. tract. 1. cap.</hi> 9. ſaith, That it is fit, that if poſſible, we abſtain from <hi>Collyriums</hi> the firſt three dayes. And a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he ſaith, That we ought not in the beginning to apply ſtrong Aſtringents and thickners: becauſe they thicken the Tunicles or coats, and hinder reſolution and increaſe pain.</p>
                     <p>Yet we need be ſo exact in the time and number of dayes, becauſe the Diſeaſe is in ſome older, and in ſome yonger: But we may with profit apply Aſtringents at the beginning to the Forehead and Temples; for by thoſe, the veins by whith the humors flow to the Eyes are ſtopt, and they driven back.</p>
                     <p>The Form of this is as followeth.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Bole-Armonick, ſanguis Draconis, Frankinſence, Maſtich, of each one dram: red Roſes, Balaſts, or Pomegranat flowers, &amp; the pouder of Lentils, of each two ſcruples: mix them with the white of an Egg and Vinegar of Roſes, and make a Cataplaſm for the Forehead, and Temples.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Moreover, A Cataplaſm made of the Juyce of Nettles and Wheat flower, applied to the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head and Temples, is excellent to ſtay a defluxion by reaſon the Juyce of Nettles hath a ſpecial Vertue for the ſtopping of al ſorts of Bleedings, as it doth the bleeding at the Noſe or Mouth.</p>
                     <p>But if the pain be very great, which uſeth to encreaſe the defluxion upon the Eyes, you muſt apply Anodines or Medicines aſſwaging pains upon them. Among which new milk, eſpecially if it be that which a ſound woman giveth is beſt, if it be often milked freſh into the Eyes from the breaſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not be uſed ſtale, for then it wil grow ſowr and be offenſive to them: inſtead thereof you may uſe freſh Cheeſe made of Sheeps milk, which you muſt often change, leſt it turn like Butter, and ſo inflame the Eye.</p>
                     <p>The white of an Egg wel beaten til it turn to water, is commended of <hi>Galen,</hi> for it aſſwageth pain, and gently ſtayes the Flux.</p>
                     <p>Alſo an Apple roaſted in the Embers doth much aſſwage the pain of the Eyes.</p>
                     <p>The Mucilages, or ſlime of the ſeeds of Fleabane, Quinces, Foenugreek, drawn with Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, do take away pain; but they muſt be renewed every day or they wil grow ſowr.</p>
                     <p>Of theſe things you may make divers kinds of Medicines. As for Example.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the pap of a ſweet Apple roaſted in the embers, an ounce: the Mucilage of the ſeeds of Fleabane and Quinces drawn with Roſe Water, of each ſix drams: the white of a new laid Eg beaten into water, and womans Milk, of each one dram: Make a Cataplaſm and apply it to the Eyes.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="82" facs="tcp:49088:54"/>Take of <hi>the pap of a roaſted Apple one ounce: Crums of white Bread half an ounce: one Egg mixed with Breaſt milk: Make of theſe a Cataplaſm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thin ſlices of Goats Fleſh, Veal, or Mutton, often applied to the Eyes, do very much aſſwage pain.</p>
                     <p>A Cataplaſm may be made more eaſily with crums of white Bread, and Womans Milk mixed with Roſe Water.</p>
                     <p>If the pain be intollerable, you muſt fly to Narcotick or ſtupifying Medicines, which you muſt uſe ſparingly, and with good advice, becauſe they do thicken the viſive Spirits, and make the Humors and Tunicles groſs, by which the Sight will become dim.</p>
                     <p>Among Narcoticks for the Eyes, the white Troches of <hi>Rhaſis</hi> are principal; made with Opium thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Roſe water two ounces: the Water of an Eg well beaten one ounce: the white Troches of</hi> Rhaſis <hi>with Opium, one dram: Make a Collyrium, or Water for the Eyes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When the pain is aſlwaged, you muſt come to repelling Medicines, which muſt be gentle and mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Anodines continually: for this end make this Collyrium following:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Plantane and Roſe water, of each one ounce and an half: the Water of the white of an Egg beaten, one ounce: the white Troches of Rhaſis with Opium, one dram: Make a Collyrium, and drop it often into the Eyes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the pain be very great, you may put to it Womans Milk, and the Mucilages aforeſaid.</p>
                     <p>This following Medicine doth powerfully reſiſt inflamation, and ſtay the flux.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the white of an Eg, beat it in a pewter diſh with a piece of Allum very well, till it come to the conſiſtence of an Oyntment, which you muſt ſpread upon a linnen cloth, and apply it warm to the Eyes: After two or three hours take it away, left by its long continuance having an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary aſtringent quality from the Allum, it retain the humors in the Eyes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Alſo the Water of Allum diſtilled in an Alembick, laid to the Eye with a linnen clout, doth allay the inflamation thereof.</p>
                     <p>The Salt of Lead diſſolved in Roſe Water, or Wine Vinegar, or mixed with Pomatum, doth po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfully cool the inflamation.</p>
                     <p>In the encreaſe of the Diſeaſe you muſt mix digeſtives with Repelling Medicines, and therfore you muſt put the Water of Eyebright, Fennel, Celondine, and the Mucilage of Linſeeds, <hi>Althaeae,</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Marſh-mallows, and Foenugreek, <hi>Gal. 13. Meth.</hi> commends eſpecially the Decoction of Fenugreek, becauſe it digeſteth, concocteth, and moderately repelleth: but you muſt ſift the Fenugreek to take out the duſt, and after waſh it often in warm Water, before you boyl it, or make the Mucilage of it. You may thus make a Collyrium.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Mucilage of the ſeed of Foenugreek, and Quinces drawn with Roſe, and Eyebright Water, of each one ounce and an half: the white Troches of</hi> Rhaſis <hi>with Opium, one dram: Tut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty prepared half a dram: Make a Collyrium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When the Diſeaſe is at the height, you may put Sarcocol to it, which is of a more digeſtive quality; but ſince it is apt to hurt the Eyes by its over dryneſs and ſharpneſs, it muſt firſt be ſteeped ſome few daies in Milk, often changed, and you muſt prepare but a little at one time, for if it be long kept it wil grow ſowr, and hurt the Eyes. You may uſe it thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the flowers of Chamomel, Melilot, and red Roſes, of each one pugil: the ſeeds of Foenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greek clenſed one dram: boyl them in Plantane Water. Diſſolve in four ounces of the ſtraining, Sarcocol one dram: Tutty prepared, and of the white Troches of</hi> Rhaſis <hi>without Opium, of each half a dram: Make a Collyrium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Authors do commend ſome Waters to be very powerful.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quercetan</hi> commends the infuſion of <hi>Crocus Metallorum</hi> made in Eyebright and Fennel Water, which is ſtrong enough, and is no waies too ſharrp for the Eyes as others are.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Crollius</hi> and the reſt of the Chymicks, do highly commend the Salt of Lead diſſolved in Roſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to which they put a few grains of Sul Armonick. The manner is thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Salt of Lead twelve grains: Sal Armonick three grains: Roſe Water three ounces: Mix them, and drop ſome into the Eye morning and evening.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is alſo a Water made of calcined or burnt Lead, or Litharge, or Menium infuſed in Vinegar, which laid to the Eye with a linnen clout preſently cureth their inflamation.</p>
                     <p>The Water of white Vitriol is moſt common, being diſſolved in Roſe or Plantane Water; this mitigateth inflamations, diſcuſſeth, and hindereth defluxions. Thus they are proportioned:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>white Vitriol one ſcruple: Roſe or Plantane Water four ounces: Diſſolve the Vitriol in it at the fire: Strain the Water and drop it into the Eyes. If it be too ſharp, you may qualifie it as you pleaſe with more Roſe or Plantane Water.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This following Medicine is not ſo ſharp, and more diſſolving.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Flower-de-luce Roots, and red Roſes, of each one ſcruple: Roſe and Plantane Water,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49088:54"/>
of each three ounces: Boyl them to the third part with a gentle fire. Ad to the ſtraining white Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol poundered eight grains: Make a Collyrium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Many Oyntments alſo are uſed for the Eyes, of which, theſe three following are the beſt, and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times do wonders. The firſt is in <hi>Renodaeus</hi> his Diſpenſatory, called <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum Ophthalmium,</hi> made thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Bole-Armenick waſhed in Roſe Water, one ounce: Lapis Calaminaris waſh'd in Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bright Water, and Tutty prepared, of each two drams: Pearl finely poudered half a dram: Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire half a ſcruple: Opium five grains: Butter as much as will be ſufficient to make an Oyntment according to art, for to be applied to the corners of the Eyes, and the Eye-lids.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſecond is <hi>John Cratoes,</hi> which is ſet down in his Phyſical Counſels gathered by <hi>Laurence Scholzius, Conſ.</hi> 6. thus:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Butter made in</hi> May, <hi>if you can get it, or other that is freſh and well worked, or the marrow of an Ox or Deers Shank, and mix therewith as much of the fine pouder of Lapis Calaminar is as it will receive, make an Oyntment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third is from <hi>Paenotus in denario,</hi> thus made:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Tutty prepared one ounce and an half: Camphire one dram: Verdegreece twelve grains Beat the Tutty with the Camphire together in a Mortar, the Verdegreece by its ſelf, all very ſine: Then take of freſh Butter one ounce: Roſe water, one dram: boyl them gently together, and then take them from the fire, and firſt put in your Camphire with your Tutty, then your Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degreece by degrees; ſtir them very well, and reſerve them in a glaſs. Make an Oyntment and ſtrain it through a Sarſenet; anoint the inſide of the Eye-lids, eſpecially about the corners, and the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent will ſoon recover. This is a moſt approved Medicine againſt Inflamations both with matter and dry, againſt itching of the Eyelids, and weeping.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is another very good, though ſharp, and therefore muſt be only applied to the Eye-lids; it is thus made: (And when al have failed, this hath cured the moſt deſperate Ophthalmy) namely, Of <hi>May Butter, and Juyce of Tobacco boyled to an Oyntment, which muſt be applied, the Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids being cloſed, and in a darkroom; as ſoon as the Patient opens his Eyes, it will begin to bite, and will certainly cure.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the height of the diſeaſe, you muſt apply more reſolving than repelling Medicines, therefore they which were preſcribed in the encreaſe of it are good in the height or ſtate of it, if you encreaſe the quantity of the Reſolvers, and diminiſh the Repellers. But eſpecially theſe two following Oyntments may be uſed not only in the ſtate and height, but in the declination, to the perfect cure of the Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt Fomentations to diſcuſs the matter, are good in the height of the Diſeaſe, made thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the flowers of Chamomel, Melilot, and Roſes, of each one pugil: Foenugreek ſeeds pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared as before ſhewed, two drams: Make a Decoction, with which foment the Eyes with four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>double clouts. This is good in the end, of the encreaſe, and the beginning of the ſtate of the Diſeaſe; and in Winter you muſt uſe it hot, in Summer only warm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the end of the ſtate and declination, you muſt make a more reſolving Fomentation, which is done by adding to the former Ingredients, the Leaves of Eyebright, Marjoram, Bettony, and a little white Wine.</p>
                     <p>The beſt and rareſt Secret fro the Cure of an Ophthalmy, is made of the Oyl which cometh from Linnen burnt between two cloſe diſhes; one drop of which mixed with the ſpittle of a Child muſt be dropped into the Eye with a Feather.</p>
                     <p>In the declination, not only the Remedies afore mentioned, but alſo Waters more reſolving are to be uſed, as thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Frankinſence and Aloes, of each half a dram: Sarcocol waſhed with Breaſt-milk, one dram and an half: Saffron half a ſcruple: the Mucilage of Foenugreek half an ounce: Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel and Eyebright Water, of each one ounce and an half. Make a Collyrium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if you wil, dry more, and alſo digeſt.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Sarcocol one dram and an half: Tutty prepared one dram: Aloes one ſcruple: Mirrh half a ſcruple: the Mucilage of Foenugreek half an ounce: Vervain and Celondine Water, of each one ounce. Make a Collyrium.</hi>

                     <p>Moreover, In the declination Authors do ſet down two ſpecial Remedies, namely, The uſe of Wine, and Baths: which firſt were delivered by <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> Aph. 31.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Galen</hi> alſo commends a Bath in a Flegmatick Ophthalmy, alwayes uſing before Evacuations ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, becauſe the thick humors faſtened in the Eyes are extenuated by Baths, and ſo are eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed.</p>
                     <p>So <hi>Galen</hi> in the ſame place ſaith, That the drinking of pure Wine is good for thoſe who have thick blood in the veins of their eyes, and have not groſs or phlegmatick bodies; becauſe Wine doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, diffuſe, and diſcuſs the thick blood, and alſo openeth obſtructions.</p>
                     <p>For the taking away of the remainder of Redneſs and Inflamation, make this Fomentation fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Leaves of Eyebright and Pennyroyal of each one handful: the Flowers of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momel, Melilot, and red Roſes; and of Oaten chaff, of each one pugil: Foenugreek-ſeed three drams: Fennel-ſeed one dram: make a Decoction, adding in the end a little white Wine, foment the Eye with this, dipping therein linnen Cloaths, or with bags being half filled with the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid ingredients.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fennel watter alone mixed with aſtringent wine is a good Fomentation to diſcuſs the reliques, and to ſtrengthen the eyes.</p>
                     <p>An Egg boyled hard, and the ſhel taken off, and cut in the middle, laid hot to the eye, takes away the remainder of redneſs.</p>
                     <p>So doth a Fomentation made only of the Decoction of Hyſop.</p>
                     <p>An old Ophthalmy requires another and longer way of Cure, and is ſomtimes very troubleſom to a Phyſitian; becauſe he can hardly hinder a delicate and noble part from receiving a defluxion by which it hath been long weakned.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, This Diſeaſe is not only nouriſhed by defluxion, but by congeſtion whereby there is deſtemper brought into the part, which alſo is hard to cure.</p>
                     <p>But for the Cure of it you muſt firſt obſerve whether the Diſeaſe come not from a hot Diſtemper of the Liver, as often it doth: and then you muſt firſt adminiſter ſuch things as amend that. And chiefly after convenient Purging and Bleeding, Baths are good, Whey, and Mineral waters of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, as alſo Horſleeches applyed to the Hemorrhoids.</p>
                     <p>But if the matter of the Diſeaſe come only from the diſtemper of the Brain through which watery Humors flow to the eyes being mixed with ſome blood: then you muſt fal to purging the head with ordinary Pills, twice, thrice, or four times in a month, after you have given univerſal Medicines, as Apozemes or the like; which you may make according to our deſcription in the cure of cold Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Head.</p>
                     <p>If the aforeſaid Purges with other Medicines now preſcribed do not prevail, you muſt uſe Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Purges as the moſt excellent, by way of intermiſſion.</p>
                     <p>Moreover a Cautery applied to the hinder part of the head is very profitable, to divert the humor flowing.</p>
                     <p>Inſtead whereof you may apply a Seton to the Neck behind, with better ſucceſs, to them who can endure it.</p>
                     <p>A Veſicatory applied to the fore-part of the Head, as <hi>Foreſtus</hi> reports, <hi>Obſ. 11. lib.</hi> 11. did a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful cure upon an Old Woman with ſore eyes.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Rondoletius</hi> ſayes, That a Cautery applied to the Coronal Suture, is better than to any other part.</p>
                     <p>Maſticatories are profitable for the deriving of the Defluxion, but not Errhins becauſe they are applied ſo neer the part affected that they may draw humors to it.</p>
                     <p>But if the Brain doth ſeem to want drying, you muſt have recourſe to your ſweating diet drink of China, Saria, and the like.</p>
                     <p>To theſe you may ad Topicks, which reſolve and ſtrengthen the eyes; ſuch as are Fomentations and Unguents before mentioned for the ſtate and declination of the Diſeaſe, which alſo are excellent for old Ophthalmies: nor muſt you forget the waſhing of the eyes as above mentioned with Fennel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water and red Wine, to take away the remainder of the redneſs, and to ſtrengthen the eyes every mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>This takes away the oldeſt redneſs; it dryes up weeping, and Fiſtulaes; it conſumes al ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous moiſtures upon the outward membranes and quickens the ſight. This alſo following is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent.</p>

And with this Remedy uſed many nights together many eyes have been cured which could not otherwiſe; and this kind of Medicine prevailes chiefly among Children that have ſore eyes.</p>
                     <p>For a Concluſion of this Chapter, it wil not be amiſs to ſet down the experimental Medicines of <hi>Sacutus Luſitanus</hi> who cured an old Ophthalmy w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> would no otherwiſe be removed in a whol yeer with a Mercurial Unguent, although there was no ſign of the French Pox: being perſwaded by <hi>Mercurialis,</hi> who in his Book of the French Pox ſaith, <hi>When you ſee any Diſeaſe that will not be Cured by ordinary means, imagine it to be the French Pox.</hi> He asked the Patient if ever he had the French Diſeaſe, or ever lay with a foul bodied Woman?

                     </head>
                     <p>AFter an Ophthalmy, there followeth often Ulcers in the Tunicles called <hi>Cornea</hi> and <hi>Adnata,</hi> when it comes to ſuppuration. They follow alſo the <hi>Phlyctaenae</hi> or Puſtles, which bred in the <hi>Cornea,</hi> but not till they break. They alſo uſe to come from ſharp corroding humors flowing into the Eyes.</p>
                     <p>There are divers ſorts of theſe Ulcers mentioned in Authors, taken from their divers circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as they are ſuperncial or profound, broad or narrow, and according as they differ in ſhape and figure, and the like. So a hollow, narrow, and hard Ulcer is called <hi>Bothrion,</hi> or <hi>Foſſula</hi> like a little
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49088:56"/>
trench: A broad and not ſo deep an Ulcer, is called <hi>Coil oma:</hi> That which cometh in the Circle Iris, is called <hi>Argemon,</hi> or <hi>Vlcus Coronale:</hi> Finally, that which is deep and hard, is called <hi>Epicayma,</hi> and <hi>Egcayma.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The knowledg of Ulcers is eaſie, for they may be ſeen: If the Ulcer be in the Cornea, there will be a ſmal white blemiſh in the black of the Eye; if in the Adnata, there wil be a ſmal white blemiſh in the white of the Eye, becauſe the Veins of the Tunicle Adnata are ful of blood.</p>
                     <p>The Ulcer of the Eyes are dangerous, and hard to be cured; but more in the Cornea than in the Adnata. An Ulcer in the Pupilla is more dangerous, becauſe after it is cured, it wil leave a Scar, which wil hinder the perſpicuity of the Cornea, and ſo the ſight wil be hurt; and if the whol Tuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle be corroded, the Watery Humor wil flow out, and the Uvea ſtart forth.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of this Diſeaſe, as of other Ulcers, is, By clenſing and drying means; but they muſt be very gentle by reaſon of the tenderneſs of the part, and exquiſitneſs of the ſence. But you muſt firſt uſe ſuch things as revel and hinder the flux or humors from the Eyes; as in Ophthalmy either old or new, were declared. And if there be an Inflamation with it, you mix muſt things that are proper for that. With which alſo you may uſe things that aſſwage pain, if there be any.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things do moderately dry and clenſe: Sugar, Honey, Saffron, Mirrh, Frankinſence, Aloes, Sarcocol, Tutty, and Ceruſs; of which you may make theſe following Medicines:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Barley and Foenugreek Water boyled, four ounces: the beſt Honey half an ounce: or of the Syrup of dried Roſes, one ounce: Make a Collyrium to waſh the Eyes often.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Vervain and Plantane Water, of each two ounces: Sugar candy half an ounce. Mix them for a Collyrium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Water of Honey diſtilled in</hi> Balneo, <hi>and of Roſe water, of each equal parts.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>a hard Egg peel'd, cut it in two pieces, and taking out the Yolk fill the hollow with the pouder of Sugar candy; tie it faſt, and hang it in a Wine Celler, and you ſhall have a Water drop from it, which is excellent to clenſe the Eyes without pain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if you wil have it ſtronger mix the Pouder of Mirch with your Sugar candy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Montanus</hi> highly commends this Pouder following:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Twenty Whites of new laid Eggs, put them in a pewter diſh in the Sun till they are dry: then pouder them finely with as much Sugar; and this pouder put into the Eyes, doth much good without cauſing pain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the Progreſs of this Diſeaſe, if you will clenſe and dry more, put to the former Medicines the white Troches of <hi>Rhaſis,</hi> Frankinſence, Aloes, Mirrh, Sarcocol, or the like, but in a ſmal quantity leſt it be too ſharp, and alſo mix them with Milk, white of an Eg, ſome Mucilages, and other Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines, or things that mitigate and aſſwage pain.</p>
                     <p>Tutty is the beſt, for it cauſeth no pain, and dryeth and healeth; therefore Collyriums, or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guents are good that are made thereof. And chiefly the Oyntment preſcribed in the cure of Oph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalmy, which hath in it a great quantity of Tutty.</p>
                     <p>This following is very clenſing, drying, and healing.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Sarcocol ſteep'd in Roſe Water, Ceruſs and waſhed Aloes, Mirrh, and Tutty prepared, of each half a dram: Sugar candy one dram: With the Mucilage of Gum Traganth drawn with Roſe Water, make a Collyrium, with which anoint the Eye-lids.</hi>

                        <hi>Chap. 12.</hi> Of a Cancer in the <hi>Cornea.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>AS a Cancer may come in other parts, ſo ſomtimes it breeds in the Eyes. And though the knowledg and Cure of a Cancer is in the Treatiſe of external Diſeaſes, yet we wil ſpeak briefly here of thoſe things which properly belong to a Cancer in the Eye.</p>
                     <p>A Cancer is either occult, or hidden, or ulcerated. The occult is reckoned among Tumors, and it is called a Cancerous Tumor, or Cancer of the Eye: But the ulcerated is called a Cancerous Ulcer in the Eye.</p>
                     <p>But in both there is an unequal hardneſs, a blew Lead color, a ſtrong pricking pain, eſpecially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Head and Temples: the Veins adjoyning are blew, and very full. Somtimes aduſt and ſharp blood floweth from the part affected, when the Cancer is ulcerated. And this pain is encreaſed by any warm Medicines.</p>
                     <p>This Diſeaſe is incurable, as wel in the Eye as in any other part, when it is fixed; except it be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away by manual operation.</p>
                     <p>Authors propound two waies of Cure, namely a True, and a Palliative. A true Cure (as was ſaid) cannot be wrought but by Chyrurgery when the Cancer is fixed: but when it is new in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, it may be cured by often evacuation of the Chollerick humor, firſt having let blood; as <hi>Galen</hi> teacheth 2. <hi>ad Glauconem, cap.</hi> 10. where he boaſteth that he hath often cured this diſeaſe, adjoyning a convenient Diet with the aforeſaid Phyſick.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="88" facs="tcp:49088:57"/>A Palliative Cure, which tends only to the mitigation of Symptoms, is done not only by the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Evacuations' but alſo by convenient Topicks.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then you muſt appoint a convenient Diet, ſuch as is good againſt burnt Cholle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>; and it muſt be cooling and moiſtning.</p>
                     <p>Then draw Blood on the ſame ſide, and apply Horſleeches behind the Ears, and alſo to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhoids if they do appear, applying Cupping Glaſſes to the Shoulders, and uſe other kinds of Revulſions.</p>
                     <p>You muſt alſo prepare and Purge Melancholly by Potions, Apozemes, opening Broaths, by Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtral Syrups, and the like: But above al for the purging of Melancholly black Hellebor wel pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared is the beſt; and by giving the Extract thereof twice or thrice, we have ſomtimes cured a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer in the beginning.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Remedies do exceedingly diminiſh the Humors that flow to the Eyes, and take away pains and other Symptoms: for which purpoſe alſo Topicks are good, ſuch as are preſcribed in Ophthal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, for aſſwaging of pain: eſpecially the Collyria made of Mucilages, the white Troches of Rha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, and prepared Tutty, with the water of Roſes, Nightſhade, and Plantane.</p>
                     <p>This following Water is a good Collyrium to waſh the Eye with.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Roots of Pilewort, and herb Robert, of each two handfuls: Ribwort, Nightſhade, Borrage, Bugloſs, Purſlain, Eyebright, and Bettony, of each one handful: green Frogs, and whites of Eggs, of each twelve in number: the ſeeds of Foenugreek and Quinces, of each one ounce: let the Roots and Seeds be bruiſed, and the Leaves Cut: then pour upon them of Eyebright and Roſewater of each one pint: mix them and Diſtil them in a pewter Still.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The fleſh of Chickins is very powerful to alſwage pain: and ſome ſay that the Diſeaſe it ſelf hath been Cured by it alone. So <hi>Maritius Cordaeus,</hi> Comment. 7. in lib. 1. <hi>Hipp.</hi> of Womens Diſeaſes, relates a hiſtory of a noble Woman, who had the right ſide of her face a long time infected with a Cancer ulcerated, and having tryed al means ſhe could from Italian, French, German, and Spaniſh Phyſitians, was at length Cured with this vulgar Medicine by a Barber: He took Chickins and cut them in thin broad pieces, which he often applied to the Cancer: Others apply the fleſh of yong Pigeons ſo cut, while it is warm.</p>
                     <p>Finally, The true Cure of a fixed Cancer is only by taking it out by the roots, and is by a taking out of the Eye; which <hi>Fabricius Hildanus</hi> ſaith may be done very ſafely; and he ſheweth the manner and Circumſtances thereof at large, <hi>Obſerv. 1.

                     <p>HItherto we have ſpoken of the Diſeaſes of the Eyes which happen in the humors and upon the Tunicles; it remaineth that we ſpeak of the Diſeaſes of the Corners of the Eyes and Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids.</p>
                     <p>And firſt of the Tumor in the great Corner of the Eye, by the Root of the Noſe, called <hi>Aegylops,</hi> and <hi>Anchylops</hi> if not broken.</p>
                     <p>This little Tumor, is either with, or without Inflamation.</p>
                     <p>When it is inflamed, it is like a ſmal Phlegmon: or Bile, red about, with a ſhooting pain. And it comes of thin and chollerick blood that flows into the part by the veins of the Temples, Fore-head, and Face, and ſo impoſtumateth; which being open produceth an Ulcer, which ſpeedily turns hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and then it is called <hi>Fiſtula Lachrymalis.</hi> And if this continueth one yeer, there is a Caries or foulneſs of the Bone, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith, 45. <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. In Ulcers of a yeer old, the Bone is foul: And this Caries is known by the Cavity, which is known by the finger: and by the ſtinking Matter flowing from it.</p>
                     <p>Somtimes it comes without Inflamation, and then it is bred of a thick ſlimy Humor, like Pulſe or Hony: As the Tumors called <hi>Atheromata, Stea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>omata, Meliceris,</hi> which are without pain.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of an <hi>Aegylops</hi> is very hard, both in regard Medicines are ill to be applied to it, by reaſon the ſight is ſo nigh; and becauſe an Impoſtume wil quickly Ulcerate in ſuch a tender part (as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid) But it is moſt difficult when the Impoſtume breaks out at the Noſe, and the Matter flows through the Noſtrils; becauſe thereby the Bones wil be putrified.</p>
                     <p>Somtimes <hi>Aegylops</hi> turns to a Cancer, which comes with a pricking pain; extenſion of the veins, hardneſs and blewneſs of the skin, and then it is better to let it alone, becauſe Medicines wil enlarge it, and encreaſe pain.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Lachrymal Fiſtula</hi> that is newly begun, and which hath an external orifice to be ſeen, is cure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by Medicines; but that which is deep and old, and hath fouled the Bone, is ſcarcely Cured with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out burning.</p>
                     <p>The divers times of theſe Diſeaſes require divers Medicines.</p>
                     <p>And Firſt in the beginning of an <hi>Aegylops</hi> you muſt revel the defluxion from the part by bleeding and purging; and uſe repelling Medicines to the Forehead, by which ſomtimes the Progreſs is ſtopt before it come to ſuppuration.</p>
                     <p>For this end, uſe the following <hi>Ceratum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Pomegranate-peels, Acacia, Pomegranate flowers, Galls, Cypreſs-nuts, Roch-A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, Bole-Armenick, of each one dram: white Wax four ounces: Turpentine three drams: Make a Cerate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After the uſe of Repercuſſives, you muſt apply Reſolvers to the part affected, as this Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>pure Honey and Aloes, of each two ounces: Mirrh one ounce: Saffron one dram
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49088:58"/>
and an half: Water two pints: Boyl them gently to the conſumption of half: dip a piece of ſoft Spunge therein, ſqueeze it a little, and apply it hot to the part, bind it on; and do thus often.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Amatus Lucitanus, Curatione 68. Cent.</hi> 5. preſcribes a Cerat againſt Aegylops, which he highly commends, which is this:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Pouder of Cockle ſhels, two drams: Mirrh, waſhed Aloes, and Frankinſence, of each half an ounce: Sarcocol, Dragons blood, and Ceruſs, of each three drams: Opopanax diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Wine, Vinegar and Blood-ſtone, of each one dram and an half: Saffron two ſcruples<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wax and Rozin, of each three ounces: Mix them according to art at the fire, and make a Cerate to be applied to the corner of the Eye.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the Tumor wil not be reſolved with the former Medicines, but wil come to ſuppuration, you muſt help it forward with a Plaiſter of Simple Diachylon; or if there be pain or inflamation, you may apply a Cataplaſm of Crums of Bread. If it wil not break<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> open it with a Lancet, and delay not leaſt the matter contained do corrode the parts, and make an incurable Fiſtula. Many open it with a hot Iron, but the cold is beſt.</p>
                     <p>After the impoſthume is opened, you muſt clenſe the Ulcer, and heal it as others. But if it fiſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, cure it thus:</p>
                     <p>Firſt make a general Evacuation by bleeding and purging. You muſt divert the defluxion from the Head by Cupping-glaſſes, Veſicatories, and Cauſticks applied to their proper places; and then uſe the decoction of China, or Sarſaparilla, for many daies. And at the ſame time dry the Brain with Fumes and Head Pouders, as in a Catarrh.</p>
                     <p>Inſtead of a Cautery you may apply a Seton to the Neck; for <hi>Fabricius Hildanus</hi> reports Obſ. 41. Cent. 1. that it hath done it alone without other means.</p>
                     <p>If the diſtemper of the Liver be the Cauſe of the defluxion (as it often is) you muſt have a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial care to adminiſter Medicines proper for that.</p>
                     <p>When you uſe Topicks, open the orifice of the Ulcer, and dilate it by degrees, with a Tent made of an Elder pith, a ſpunge made fit, or a Gentian Root. When it is large enough, apply this following Medicine, commended by <hi>Foreſtus, Obſ. 17. Lib.</hi> 11.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Honey two ounces: Verdegreece one dram: Water of Rue four ounces: Pouder the Verdegreece very fine, and boyl it with the reſt at a gentle fire till the third part be conſumed, and make a warm injection of the ſtrained Liquor with a Syringe: if this be too ſharp, waſh the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer every day with the Water of Rue, and after apply a little</hi> Unguentum Apoſtolorum. <hi>Continue this courſe for three weeks, laying on ſome convenient Plaiſter, and defending the Eye with Roſe Water.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When the Ulcer is ſufficiently purged, uſe this following Collyrium to incarnate and cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trize:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Frankinſence, Aloes, Dragons blood, Pomegranate flowers, Allum, and Antimony, of each one dram: Verdegreece five grains: Pouder them fine, and with Rue Water make a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyrium to be dropt in with a ſtalk of Rue, thrice in a day, and put in a tent wet therewith, laying upon it a Diapalma Plaiſter: Leſſen your Tent by degrees, and at length take it quite out, only waſhing the part with the aforeſaid Collyrium, and laying on Diapalma.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Foreſtus</hi> in the place cited ſaith, that new fiſtulaes have been cured thus by a famous Chyrurgeon of his time.</p>
                     <p>If it appear that the bone be foul, it muſt only be cured by an actual Cautery; the manner of which is exactly deſcribed in <hi>Paraeus, Fallopius,</hi> and <hi>Aquapendente</hi> in their Works: But <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricus Hildanus</hi> Obſ. 22. Cent. 5. boaſteth that he cured a Fiſtula lachrymalis with foulneſs at the Bone, that was four yeers old, and counted deſperate, in a child of thirteen yeers of age, with Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines alone, dilating of it with prepared Spunges, and after ſprinkling Euphorbium into it, and that very much and often; and after applying only an Emplaiſter of Gum Elemi. Having uſed theſe things diligently for the ſpace of divers weeks, he perceived a ſcale of the Bone, which he drew forth; and then with half a drop of Tolutan Balſom upon a little Lint, once in a day conveyed into the Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, he perfectly conſolidated the Fiſtula in a ſhort time.</p>

                        <hi>Encanthis</hi> is contrary to <hi>Rhyas,</hi> which is the immoderate encreaſe and ſwelling of the Caruncle,

or little fleſh in the great corner of the Eye; and this comes from much blood flowing to the part, and the not orderly curing and drying up of the Ulcer.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of <hi>Rhyas</hi> is by Incarnatives, ſuch as follow:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>red Roſes, one pugil: Cypreſs Nuts, and Myrtles, of each two drams: Aloes one dram and an half: old Wine one pint: Boyl them till the fourth part be conſumed: waſh the part often with this Decoction.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Aloes and Frankinſence, of each one dram: Dragons blood half a dram: red Roſes and ſeeds of Sumach, of each one ſcruple: Roſe Water one pint: boyl them to the conſumption of the fourth part. Make a Collyrium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Encanthis</hi> is cured by taking away of the ſuperfluous fleſh growing in the corner of the Eye; this is done with eating Medicines, beginning with the mildeſt firſt, therfore firſt uſe burnt Allum; after proceed to <hi>Apoſtolorum Aegyptiacum,</hi> or burnt Vitriol. But if theſe will not do, cut it out, or burn it with an Iron. But before you do theſe things you muſt prepare the Body with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Evacuations leaſt you cauſe a new defluxion: but in the cutting, burning, or conſuming of this Caruncle with Medicines, you muſt take heed that you take it not wholly away, but only that which is ſuperfluous, otherwiſe it wil turn to <hi>Rhyas.</hi>

                        <hi>Chap: 17:</hi> Of Epiphora.</head>
                     <p>THe word <hi>Epiphora</hi> ſignifieth any Defluxion into any part. But through cuſtom it is uſed eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for the defluxion of a thin Rhewm from the Eyes; hence it is called involuntary wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, which flows dayly from the corners of the Eyes.</p>
                     <p>For the producing of which Humor flowing preternaturally there is an evil diſpoſition in the part from whence it cometh, and in the part receiving it: the part that ſends this humor is the Brain, which when it is too hot, or too cold gathereth a watery Humor, and ſo ſends it to the inferior parts, which are fit to receive it: The part receiving is the Glandle or Kernel by the great corner of the Eye, and the Caruncle upon the corner; the thinneſs, or thickneſs, or other weakneſs of which parts cauſeth that they eaſily entertain the humors that flow thither. Therefore an Epiphora happeneth often in an Egylops, a Lachrymal Fiſtula, a Rhyas, and Encanthis, becauſe the ſuperfluous humors uſe to be eaſily received into the parts affected.</p>
                     <p>This humor is carried from the Brain into the corners of the Eyes, ſomtimes by the internal Veins, ſomtimes by the external, as we ſhal ſhew you hereafter by their proper ſigns.</p>
                     <p>But the Humor which maketh an Epiphora, is ſomtimes cold, and brings no other inconvenience, but only defluxion, ſomtimes it is ſalt and ſharp, and cauſeth pain, heat, and redneſs, and exulcera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Eyebrows.</p>
                     <p>There need no ſigns to be given of Tears, they are viſible. It wil appear by what hath been ſaid whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are cold or hot, and ſharp. But we muſt diſtinguiſh whether they come by the internal or external Veſſels. When by the internal, there is pain in the inſide of the head, and ſomtimes violent neeſing. But if they come by the external without the Skul. The Veſſels of the Forehead and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are ſtretched, and the head ſeems to be bound about and aſtringent means, outwardly applyed do help.</p>
                     <p>As to the Prognoſtick; New Epiphora's coming from outward cauſes are eaſily cured, eſpecially in youth: but old, and in old men very hardly. They which proceed from other diſeaſes, as Aegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lops, Fiſtula Lachrymalis and the like, have their Cure with the diſeaſes whence they came.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of this Diſeaſe conſiſts in taking away the defluxion, and ſtrengthening the part recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>
                     <p>You muſt take away the defluxion with Evacuation of the humor offending, revulſion, derivation, and ſtrengthening the part from whence it cometh.</p>
                     <p>The Peccant humor which is a Water ſuperfluous in the Brain, muſt be evacuated with bleeding and purging.</p>
                     <p>Blood-letting is not good in a cold diſtemper of the Brain, except there be manifeſt ſigns of ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thory or fulneſs; but in a hot diſtemper, when the humors are very ſharp, it is very good, and you may uſe it twice or thrice if need be.</p>
                     <p>You may purge by Potions, Apozemes, Pills, and the like, which you may proportion to the condition of the Patient.</p>
                     <p>Make a revulſion of the humors flowing by Cupping-glaſſes often applied to the ſhoulders, by Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicatories to rai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e bliſters behind in the Neck, or with Cauteries to the hinder part of the Head, and Iſſues in the Arms.</p>
                     <p>In a ſtubborn <hi>Epiphora,</hi> a Veſicatory applyed to the fore-part of the Head doth wonders; as <hi>Foreſtus</hi> ſheweth, <hi>Obſ. 11. lib.</hi> 11. concerning an Old Woman who had ſore Eyes, weeping and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:49088:59"/>
with great pain and itching, and could by no means be Cured, that with applying a Plaiſter of <hi>Cantharides</hi> with Honey and Leaven to her head being ſhaven, he perfectly Cured her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rondeletius</hi> ſaith, That a Cautery applyed to the <hi>Commiſſura,</hi> doth more good than when it is uſed to any other part.</p>
                     <p>For Derivation, uſe Leeches behind the Ears; and Maſticatories every morning.</p>
                     <p>But leaſt the Humors once evacuated ſhould breed again, the Brain muſt be ſtrengthened and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and if it be too cold, you may uſe al our Remedies preſcribed in the Cure of the cold Diſtemper of the Brain. But if it be too hot, thoſe things which we preſcribed in the Cure of a hot Catarrh; eſpecially ſuch as reſpect the Brain moſt, are here to be uſed.</p>
                     <p>While the former Medicines are uſed, you muſt apply Topicks to the part receiving; and firſt if the Humor comes through the external veins, apply Aſtringents to the Forehead and Temples: and if the Defluxion come from a ſharp hot Humor, uſe the following Cataplaſm.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Bole-Armenick, Dragons Blood, Pomegranat Flowers, and Mirtles, of each one dram and an half: Accacia and Hipociſtis of each one dram: Frankinſence and Maſtich of each two ſcruples: Red Roſes one pugil: Pouder them and mix them with the white of an Egg and a little Vinegar, make a Cataplaſm, which spread upon a Cloth and apply to the Fore-head and Temples, and renew it as faſt as it groweth dry.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If it come of a Cold Humor, apply this following Cerat.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Frankinſence and Maſtich of each one dram and an half: Gum Anime, Tacama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hacca, and Blood-ſtone, of each one dram: Gum of Juniper two ſcruples: Turpentine and Wax as much as will ſerve turn: make a Cerat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But you muſt apply Aſtringent and Drying Medicines to the part affected: which are thus made.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Tutty prepared one dram: Sarcocol half a dram: Frankinſence and Maſtich of each a ſcruple: Spicknard ſix grains: make Troches, which being mixed with the white of an Egg,</hi> or <hi>the juyce of Quinces may be applyed to the corner of the Eye.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Tutty prepared in a fine Rag, and tye it with a ſtring, and put it in ſharp Wine, and with this often waſh the Eyes.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Tutty prepared, Egg ſhells poudered, the beſt Aloes, of each one dram: tye them in a Rag and make a little Ball which ſteep in Fennel-water, and ſqueez the Ball often into the Eyes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Only Aloes poudered and made into a Ball (as above) and put into Roſe-water, is very good. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Aloes, Cypreſs Nuts, Frankinſence, Maſtich, Myrrh, of each two drams: Tutty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and Sarcocol, of each one dram and an half: Sanguis Dragonis, Barberries, Sumach, red Roſes, of each one ſcruple: Pouder them finely, and with Fennel-water make a Colly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In a Hot Defluxion this is excellent.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>white Troches of Rhaſis without Opium, Sarcocol, Lycium or Box-thorn, Acacia, Olibanum, of each one dram: the ſtones of Myrobalans calcined, of white and red Coral, of each half a dram: Pearlhalf a ſcruple: as much of the juyce of Pomegranats boyled to half, as will make a Collyrium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If Redneſs be joyned with it, this following is profitable.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the ſeeds of Sumach bruiſed one ſcruple: hot Plantane Water one ounce: macerate them a while, then preſs them ſtrongly, and put of Roſe, Eyebright, and the Waters of the white of an Egg well beaten, of each half an ounce: Sugar Candy finely poudered and ſtrained with a little water, one ſcruple: Make a Collyrium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Thoſe Medicines which were preſcribed for an Old Ophthalmy, are good in this Diſeaſe.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XVIII.</hi> Of <hi>Pterygium,</hi> or Haw in the Eyes, called <hi>Unguis.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THis is a Hard and Nervous little Membrane, which coming out of the great Corner of the Eye, firſt covereth the white, and after by continuance, the black; and covering the <hi>Pupilla,</hi> hindereth the light.</p>
                     <p>Somtimes it is thin and white; ſomtimes it is fleſhly with many red veins, and it is called a <hi>Pannicle,</hi> and <hi>Sebel,</hi> by <hi>Avicen;</hi> although ſome diſtinguiſh a <hi>Pannicle</hi> from a <hi>Haw,</hi> or <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngula;</hi> becauſe <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngula</hi> is a Nervous Tunicle without repletion of veins, and is only in the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nata:</hi> But <hi>Sebel,</hi> or <hi>Pannicle,</hi> Covereth the whole Eye, and is very Red, and full of Veins.</p>
                     <p>This Diſeaſe comes from Ulceration of the fleſh in the Corner of the Eye; or, of the <hi>Adnata,</hi> whence there comes a roughneſs or inequality in the part, which while the Nouriſhing Faculty la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors to make equal, it fills with blood, and begets a preternatural encreaſe, or covereth it with a Skin.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe many Excrements do uſe to flow to an Eye diſordered, therefore the <hi>Haw</hi> is not bred of pure Blood, but of many Excrements alſo, whence ariſe many ſorts of <hi>Haws:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,</p>
                     <p>Some are Hard, others Soft, ſome White, ſome Red, ſome Yellow, ſome Brown, others are eaſily ſeparated from the <hi>Adnata</hi> and <hi>Cornea,</hi> others ſtick faſt; ſome are ſimple and without Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity, others are Cancerous and filthy.</p>
                     <p>The Diagnoſis, or Knowledge of this Diſeaſe, is known by what is ſaid; alſo the Cauſes, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The Humors of which it is made, may be known by their Colour; for a Red <hi>Haw</hi> comes of pure Blood: a Yellow, of Choller: a White, of Flegm: a Dark and Black one, of Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly.</p>
                     <p>As to the Prognoſtick, This Diſeaſe is ſcarcely to be Cured, and that in a long time; becauſe ſharp Medicines which are proper for to eate it away, cannot be uſed but by degrees, by reaſon of the exquiſite ſenſe of the Eyes.</p>
                     <p>If the Eye Affected grow ſmaller, it is an evil ſign; for it argueth the Debility of the part.</p>
                     <p>A new <hi>Haw</hi> and ſmal, may be Cured with Medicines; but an over-grown, old, and one covering the black of the Eye, cannot, but by Chirurgery.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Haw</hi> which is thick, turn'd out, ſtretcht forth, hard and black, cannot be Cured; for it is of a Cancerous nature.</p>
                     <p>The Cure is to be by the Antecedent and Conjunct Cauſe.</p>
                     <p>In reſpect of the Antecedent, firſt good Diet is to be enjoyned, ſuch as is mentioned in other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes of the Eyes from Fluxes.</p>
                     <p>Alſo the afore-mentioned Evacuations and Revulſions may here be uſed, namely, Purgations, Bleeding, Cupping, Veſicatories, and the like.</p>
                     <p>And when the Body is ſufficiently Purged, we muſt come to Topicks, which may Conſume the <hi>Haw.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beginning firſt with Mild, ſuch as were they which we ſpake of in Curing of the Spots in the Eye, called <hi>Phlyctaenae:</hi> which not prevailing, we muſt uſe ſtronger, which are frequent in Authors.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Foreſtus</hi> commends this following.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the juyce of Fennel four ounces: the juyce of Celandine three ounces: the juyce of Rue two ounces: the juyce of Mallows two ounces and an half: Aloes one dram: Vitriol two ſcruples: Verdugreeſe one ſcruple: Ginger and Cinamon, of each half a ſcruple: the Gall of an Eel half an ounce: the Gall of an Ox, or Hog two drams: Sugar Candy two ſcruples: Let the juyces boyl with the reſt, and then clarifie it and make a Collyrium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This alſo is by him Commended.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Blood-ſtone two drams: white Vitriol and Verdegreece calcined, of each three drams: Myrrh and Saffron, of each one dram: Long Pepper half a dram: Sugar Candy half an ounce: Pouder them very fine, and mix with one dram of this Pouder two drams of Radiſh-water, and apply twice or thrice in a day, as the Patient can endure it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Before you uſe theſe Remedies, you muſt Foment the part with an Emollient Decoction, which you muſt do alſo afterwards to aſſwage the pain.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="94" facs="tcp:49088:60"/>Among the Mildeſt, this following is beſt.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Cuttle Bone, one ſcruple: Sugar Candy, one dram: Vitriol, half a ſcruple: Tutty Prepared, half a Dram: Mix them, and make a fine Pouder, to lay upon the Haw.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If it cannot be taken off with theſe Topicks, you muſt fall to Chirurgery, and taking up the <hi>

                     <p>Having made Inciſion, lay on a little Lint dipped in Roſe-water and the white of an Egg, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage pain, and hinder Inflamation.</p>
                     <p>And Laſtly, you may Heal it up with drying Medicines, as Collyriums of Tutty, Frankinſence, Aloes, the white Troches of Rhaſis, and the like.</p>

The ſymptoms in the Ears either are ſuch as come from the Action hurt, or the fault of the Excrements. The Action is hurt either in the Ear alone, or in all inſtruments of Sence. The Action proper to the Ear, namely, Hearing, is hurt by being aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed or diminiſhed and depraved. It is aboliſhed by Deafneſs, diminiſhed by thickneſs of Hearing, depraved by a noiſe in the Ears. The Action common to all the Inſtruments of Sence, is Feeling, by which they are ſubject to pain. The fault in the Excrement is ſeen by all thoſe things which come preternatur ally out of the Ear. So this whol Book hath four Chapters. The firſt is of Deafneſs and thick Hearing. The ſecond of noiſe in the Ears. The third of pain in the Ears. The fourth of thoſe things which preternaturally come forth of the Ears.</p>

                        <hi>Chap. 1.</hi> Of Deafneſs, and thick or dull Hearing.</head>
                     <p>WEE comprehend Deafneſs and thick Hearing in one Chapter, becauſe they come of the ſame Cauſes, differing only in Degrees, ſo that when they are great they take the Hearing quite away; when leſs, they diminiſh it: And both theſe are called vulgarly Deafneſs; for they who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hear any but ſuch as ſpeak very loud, are called deaf folk.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Surditas</hi> properly, or Deafneſs, is called in Greek <hi>Cophoſis,</hi> when the Hearing is totally gone; ſo that the Patient either heareth no noiſe, or if he do, he cannot diſtinguiſh it. Theſe are often dumb if they are born ſo; not only becauſe men learn to ſpeak by Hearing; but by reaſon of the great conſent that is between the Inſtruments of Hearing and Speaking by the Nerve of the fifth Conjugation, whoſe chief Branches are brought to the Ears, but ſome of them reach to the Tongue

                        </gap> is, that when the inner Ear is pulled, there is a cough raiſed; and the reaſon is plain, for they who are born deaf, if they had their Inſtruments of Speech corrupted, would by a Natural inſtinct ſend forth ſome Articulate voyce; as other Creatures, although they are kept from their birth, from other Creatures of the ſame kind, ſo that they never hear them, yet they produce their connatural voyce; but men born deaf never ſent forth an articulate voyce, but only a confuſed ſound, which argueth a manifeſt hurt of thoſe parts which ſerve for Speech. Now the hurt of thoſe parts is chiefly from humidity, which affecting that Nerve which goeth to the Ears, Tongue, and Throat, muſt needs hinder both Speech, and Hearing.</p>
                     <p>Thick Hearing is called in Greek <hi>Baruecoia;</hi> and they who are ſo hear difficultly, and underſtand not what men ſay, except they ſpeak very loud: Others cannot hear ſo wel, and not except the ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers whoop and hallow in their Ears.</p>
                     <p>Both theſe Diſeaſes come from the diſtemper of the Brain or Ears.</p>
                     <p>A cold diſtemper of the Brain, or repletion, or weakneſs, or ſome other hurt in that part, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in which is the riſe and progreſs of the Hearing Nerve, may cauſe Deafneſs or thick Hearing.</p>
                     <p>The Diſeaſes of the Ears are either in the inſide or the outſide thereof.</p>
                     <p>In the exterior Cavity, a perfect or an imperfect ſtoppace from a Tumor, Impoſthume, or Blood, Matter, Flegm, and other things coming either from within or without, may cauſe a defect in the hearing. But you muſt obſerve, that the ſtoppage of the external paſſage cannot make a perfect and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Deafneſs, but only thick hearing, becauſe ſounds may be carried by the mouth alſo, to the Ears. For there is an open way from the internal Cavity of the Ear to the Pallat, by which ſounds do eaſily paſs, and inſinuate themſelves into the Ears; and this paſſage is made for the purging of the Ears. And many Experiments do ſhew that a ſound may paſs through the open mouth to the Ears. We may obſerve that they who are very thick of hearing, wil open their mouths that they may better hear thoſe that ſpeak unto them. And if you ſtop both Ears cloſe, and ſtrike a Muſick Inſtrument with a ſtick held in your Teeth, you wil hear the ſound better. And when you travel in the night, you wil better hear any man coming afar off, if you put one end of your Sword or Staff between your Teeth, and faſten the other end upon the ground.</p>
                     <p>The Humors which are gathered into the internal Cavity of the Ear, and eſpecially ſuch as flow from the Head do cauſe deafneſs or thick hearing in the inner part of the Ear, and theſe are for the moſt part flegmy, and ſomtimes chollerick; as appears Aph. 28. Sect. 4. where <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith, that chollerick Evacuations are good for deaf men; ſomtimes bloody are good, for it is manifeſt, that the deafneſs accompanied with the Criſis, comes from the flux of blood to the Ears. Now the Humors are ſomtimes ſent from the whol Body to the Ears, as in continual Feavers and eſpecially thoſe that are malignant. The ill compoſition of the Inſtruments of Hearing produceth the ſame effect; as when the Tympany or Drum groweth too looſe by a violent noiſe or over moiſtneſs; and for this reaſon deaf people are more thick of hearing in Southernly weather, becauſe the Membrane is relaxed by the moiſtneſs of the Air; or when the Tympany is over ſtretched or dried after a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent diſeaſe, long watching, or faſting; or when it is broken by violent motions, or eaten by a corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding humor: Somtimes blood cometh forth after a great hurt, and matter without hinderance to the Hearing, becauſe the paſſage is between the bone and the Membrane. Or when any parts of the Ear, either originally; or by ſome outward cauſe, as ſtroak, fall, or the like, are put out of their Natural order. Moreover, a cold diſtemper uſeth to produce this diſeaſe, coming either from the cold Air, or very cold Water powred in, or over much uſe of ſtupefactive Medicines called Narcoticks.</p>
                     <p>'Tis very hard to diſtinguiſh al theſe cauſes by their proper Signs, but by Art, and conjecture thus:</p>
                     <p>If Deafneſs come from the diſtemper of the Brain, either other Sences ſuffer, or there appeared ſome peculiar Dileaſes in the Head, as head-ach, drouzineſs, Apoplexy, Lethargy, and the like.</p>
                     <p>The ſtoppage of the External Cavity of the Ears is diſcernable by the Eyes, if you look upon them in the Sun, for then it wil appear whether it be a tumor, or thick matter, or any other heterogeneal ſubſtance of another Nature which filleth the Cavity. As alſo the Patient will tell you if any thing fell into his Ears.</p>
                     <p>But if the internal Cavity be filled with a humor, we may conceive it to be flegm, if the Patient were formerly ſubject unto defluxions of that ſort.</p>
                     <p>But that this comes from Choller, is known by ſome Chollerick Feaver that went before, or now poſſeſſeth him, or by ſome violent pain. But when it comes from blood, there is a heavy pain, and abundance of blood in the whol Body, and this happeneth often in critical diſturbances.</p>
                     <p>The looſneſs and moiſtneſs of the Tympane is known by the cauſes preceding, which were moiſt, and diſtempered ſome other part: for it can ſcarce be, that moiſt cauſes ſhould only affect that part, and no other.</p>
                     <p>You may alſo know the diſtention and drineſs of the Tympane by the drineſs of the whol Body, and by the drying cauſes aforegoing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="97" facs="tcp:49088:61"/>And for the breaking or corroding of the Tympane, you may know that if there were formerly any vehement Cauſes that could break or gnaw the ſame.</p>
                     <p>You muſt make your Prognoſtick thus:</p>
                     <p>Deafneſs by Birth, and of long continuance, if it be abſolute and total, is incurable; and that which is not abſolute if it be old, is never or hardly cured.</p>
                     <p>A Deafnels from Choller or Blood which hapneth only in ſharp continuing Feavers, uſeth to be cured with theſe Feavers.</p>
                     <p>Thick Hearing, if it be not ſpeedily cured, endeth in perfect Deafneſs; witneſs <hi>Galen, 3. de comp. med. ſec. loc. cap.</hi> 3.</p>
                     <p>The Membrane of the Tympane being broken, or a ſcar left thereon, makes an incurable Deaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                     <p>A Deafneſs encreaſing and decreaſing by degrees, is curable, for it ſigniſieth that it comes from a movable humor, which ſomtimes is more, ſomtime leſs in quantity.</p>
                     <p>A Deafneſs coming from diſtemper of the Brain, is more eaſily cured than that which comes from a proper diſeaſe of the Ear.</p>
                     <p>As to the Cure: That Deafneſs which depends upon any Diſeaſe of the Brain, requireth no other Cure, than that which belongs to ſuch diſeaſes, which you may find in their ſeveral Chapters. That which comes from a Tumor, if it be hard and old, admitteth no Cure; but if it be hot, you may find the Cure for it in the Chapter of pain in the Ears. But if it come from matter gathered in the Ear, you may find the Cure in the laſt Chapter of this Treatiſe, where we ſhal ſpeak of thoſe things which preternaturally come forth of the Ear.</p>
                     <p>If this Diſeaſe comes of Drineſs, it muſt be cured by the way of <hi>Rhaſis,</hi> that is by moiſtning things, long ſleep, and waſhing of the Head with warm water; as alſo putting of moiſt things into the Ear, as Oyl of ſweet Almonds, and the like. If Deafneſs or thick Hearing come from any thing that is fallen into the Ear, that muſt be taken away with waſhing, ſhaking, or extraction: or if any Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine are g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t into the Cavity of the Ear, they muſt either be taken forth, or killed there: they are waſhed forth by making the part moiſt and ſlippery, and enlarging it, with either Milk, the Oyl of ſweet Almonds, or ſome mollifying or relaxing Decoction: they are ſhaken forth by neeſing, for ſo by the force of the air the parts being moved, that which lieth in the paſſage of the Ear is excluded, and the ſooner if the way be firſt made ſlippery and enlarged with Medicines (as we ſaid) It is good al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to hang down that ſide of the head, and to hop upon the log on that ſide; by which way the Boyes after ſwimming get the Water out of their Ears. If theſe wil not do, you muſt endeavor to draw it forth with an Ear-picker, taking heed, leſt when you put it in, you thruſt that which you would draw forth, further in; therefore let the ſpoon of the Ear-picker be very thin that it may eaſier paſs by the thing in the Ear. Or you may lay hold of it, and take it out with a pair of Forcepts made on purpoſe, rough on both ſides within. And if this avail not, when the body is hard, as a nut or ſtone, it muſt be laid hold on with an Inſtrument and broken, and then the Ear muſt be waſhed as aforeſaid. If the Ear-picker will not enter, arm your probe with a little Cotton all over, and then dip it in Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, or in ſome other clammy ſubſtance, and put it in the Ear that it may ſtick to that which is there, and ſtoppeth the Ear. The ſame may be done with a Wax Candle touched with Bird-lime; and if any of the Bird-lime ſtick in the Ear, you may afterwards take it out with the Ear-picker. There are ſome which put a hollow quil into the Ear, and draw out things with ſucking.</p>
                     <p>The worms in the Ears are enticed forth by laying to ſuch things as they love, as Milk with Sugar laid to the Ear in a ſpunge, or eaſily put in; or a Fig turned inſide out; or the pap of a ſweet Apple, or Bacon, and turning the Ear to the Sun at that time; and eſpecially if Horſleeches get in, they are drawn forth by an Injection of blood. Fleas are drawn forth with Dogs hair; but if they be living they muſt be killed, and then they willeſs hinder the hearing, and wil be drawn forth more eaſily: And they are killed with faſting ſpittle, or your own Urine dropt into the Ear.</p>
                     <p>Bitter things do ſooner kil thoſe Vermine, as the juyce of Wormwood, Centaury, or the Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Aloes, or Beaſts Gall. Alſo ſharp things, as Vinegar, juyce of Onions, and the like.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe the uſual cauſe of Deafneſs is a cold diſtemper and a defluxion of moiſture to that part, you muſt labor moſt to oppoſe that.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe this defluxion comes originally from the Brain, therefore we muſt begin the Cure there, as in the cure of the cold diſtemper of the Brain; which a Prudent Phyſitian wil moderate according to the degrees and violence of the diſtemper.</p>
                     <p>The brief way of Cure is, firſt an attenuating Diet, moderately warm and drying, ſuch as is preſcribed in <hi>Gutta ſerena:</hi> and then avoiding of Southernly winds, by ſtopping the Ears; and vaporing nouriſhment, as Garlick and Onions; as alſo of things that beget thick and flegmy Humors, Firſt, Let a general Evacuation be made by Pills <hi>Cephalick</hi> Purging Apozemes; then by Phlebotomy if need be; to which ad if the Diſeaſe be ſtubborn, a ſweating Diet; and then uſe particular Remedies that revel the defluxion, as Cauteries, Veſicatories, Neeſings, Maſticarories, Gargariſms: but
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49088:62"/>
Maſticatories, or Chewings; are peculiarly neceſſary in this Diſeaſe, by reaſon of the paſſage which comes from the internal Ear to the Pallat, and throws out the excrements of the Ears.</p>
                     <p>And finally, When the Diſeaſe grows old, you muſt uſe ordinary Pills, Magiſtral Syrups, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalick Opiats, Pouders and Caps to ſtrengthen the head, and the like. Al which are laid down in the Treatiſe of the Cold Diſtemper of the Brain.</p>
                     <p>In time of Diet, if the Diſeaſe be ſtubborn, Bags are good applyed to the Head after the ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Potion is adminiſtred, as in the ſaid Treatiſe is preſcribed, not only to the fore part of the Head, but to the Ears alſo.</p>
                     <p>Brimſtone and Bituminous Baths are very proper in this Diſeaſe, with waſhing of the Head, for by them ſweat is provoked, and the matter of defluxion is drawn out. But by waſhing of the Head, the Brain is ſtrengthened and dried, and the humors fixed in the Ears are diſcuſſed. The way of uſing them is deſcribed by <hi>Penotus,</hi> and much commended, in theſe words: <hi>There is nothing in the Cure of Deaſneſs more prevalent after the uſe of an bundred Medicines, than that the Patient after his Body is firſt well purged, and then his Head. Waſh his Head well in Brimſtone Baths, thus: Let him wear a great cap reaching to his Eye-lids, and beneath his Ears, made of Spunges ſewed together; let him ſit under the cock or ſpout in the Bath, and let it run upon his Head; which Water the spunges will ſuckup, and ſo keep the head in a continual heat; and ſo opening all the Sutures of the Head, and Commiſſures, it will take away all the vapors: or it will breath away the matter compacted in the Nerves, and the paſſages for Hearing, or ſo change it, that it will quickly be gone: It is good for him to ſit ſo twice in a day for two hours, and preſently after to ſweat in his bed, and uſe a ſlender Diet of Juyces and Broth, and to beware of Wine except it be very weak.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then you muſt uſe Topicks, to diſcuſs the matter faſtened in the Ear; which may be thus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Leaves of Organ, Wormwood, Penyroyal, wild Marjoram, Sage, Mints, Centau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the leſs, Mallows, and Marſh-mallows, of each one handful: the flowers of Chamomel, Melilot, Stoechas, and Roſemary, of each one pugil: Cinnamon and Cloves, of each half an ounce: Boyl theſe in equal parts of white Wine and Water: Foment the Ear wuh the ſtraming hot in a ſpunge morning and evening.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of the ſame Decoction you may make a Fumigation into the Ear by a Funnel which muſt needs be excellent becauſe the vapor ariſing from the hot Decoction muſt needs reach into the innermoſt parts of the Ears.</p>
                     <p>Inſtead of a Fomentation you may apply a hot loaf made with Caraway ſeeds, and cut in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle.</p>
                     <p>Or take ordinary Bread from the Oven, and break off the lower cruſt, and dip it in Spirit of Wine, and let the Patient endure it at his Ears as hot as may be, that the vapor may be received in.</p>
                     <p>Bread made of Bran is better with Caraway ſeeds, Bay-berries, Juniper berries, and Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megs mixed before it be baked: then after it is a little baked, break it and apply it hot to the Ears.</p>
                     <p>If you deſire a ſtonger Decoction for Fomentation and Fume, you may ad one or two drams of the Pulp of Coloquintida, and the root of white Hellebore. You may make this Decoction in white Wine alone, or with Vinegar, that it may pierce more, and diſcuſs.</p>
                     <p>The Fume of Cloves may be taken with much profit to the Patient by a Funnel into the paſſage of the Ear when the Head is covered with a warm cloth.</p>
                     <p>After Fomentations and Fumes, you muſt put ſome liquor into the Ears, and then ſtop them with Muskified Cotton.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Oyl of bitter Almonds, and Rue, of each one ounce: Mixthem and put them hot into the Ears.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Oyl of white Lillies, and Caſtor, of each one ounce: the Oyl of Dill, half an ounce: white Hellebore half a dram: Aqua vitae one ounce. Boyl them in Balneo Mariae till the Aqua vitae be conſumed; ſtrain them for the uſe aforeſaid.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Cypreſs Roots, Bay-berries, Annis and Cummin ſeed poudered, of each one dram: Pouder of Caſtor half a dram: Oyl of Rue as much as will be ſufficient: Mix them and put them into a great hellow Onion; roaſt it, and ſtrain out the Liquor to be dropped into the Ears.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Chymical Oyls work moſt powerfully; as Oly of Roſemary, Marjoram, Sage, Fennel, Spike, Cloves, which are too ſtrong to be uſed alone, therefore you muſt mix a very ſmal quantity of any of them with the Medicines mentioned; thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Oyls aforeſaid two ounces: Oyl of Spike, Fennel, Cloves, or the like, half a dram, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>There are alſo ſome Waters, which if dropped into the Ears do much good. Some Authors com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Water of an Aſh, which is made by putting one end of a green Aſh into the fire, and taking the water out of the other end: this is beſt when deafneſs cometh of a hot cauſe, and you fear to uſe hot Medicines.

                     <p>Laſtly, If the Diſeaſe be ſo ſtubborn that it will not yield to the Medicines preſcribed, it will not be amiſs to uſe the laſt Remedy which is preſcribed by <hi>Fonſeca, conſult. 58. tom.</hi> 2. namely, an Unction with Quick-ſilver, becauſe when Deafneſs cometh of the French Pox, it is ſo cured, and it may be when it comes otherwiſe; and the reaſon is, becauſe Quick-ſilver doth diſſolve and diſcuſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But this Remedy muſt not be tried but in a deſperate condition; for it is doubtful what the event wil be, and the Unction with Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver doth much weaken the Brain, and cauſe defluxions.

For by the humor there is a ſtoppage, from whence comes deafneſs, and from the wind that proceeds from that humor, comes the none.</p>
                     <p>There are other cauſes of this noiſe, as a great ſtroak upon the head, a great ſound, Ulcers in the Ears, a hot diſtemper, weakneſs, and exquiſite ſence.</p>
                     <p>A ſtroak, by moving the Spirits in the Head too violently, cauſeth a noiſe.</p>

                     <p>And Ulcers by the heat of the matter boyling and working, make a noiſe; and by the Spirits ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered thither, and moving the Natural Air.</p>
                     <p>A hot diſtemper fills the inward Arteries of the Ear with much Spirit, whence a great beating noiſe proceedeth. Somtimes too much Spirit is ſent by thoſe Arteries into the Ears, and the Natural Air is thereby moved, from whence cometh a noiſe.

                     <p>There are divers ſorts of ſounds in the Ears, which proceed either from the quantity of the vapors as they are more or few, thinner or thicker, ſwift or ſlow in motion; for if the vapor be much, thick, and of quick motion, it wil make a noiſe like ſwift running water, or like a drum, or like <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>If it be much, thin, and ſwift in motion, it cauſeth a hiſſing, or is like falling of a gentle Water. If it be little, thin, and quick in motion, it cauſeth a tickling. If it be much, thick, and of ſlow motion, it makes a murmuring noiſe. If the matter be little, thick, and ſlow in motion, it makes a kind of whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering noiſe. If it be much, thin, and of ſlow motion, it cauſeth a hiſſing. And laſtly, Becauſe the degrees of thickneſs and thinneſs, of greatneſs and ſmalneſs, of ſwiftneſs and ſlowneſs, are infinite, therefore there are innumerable ſorts of ſounds in the Ears.</p>
                     <p>There is no certain knowledg of the cauſes aforeſaid, as <hi>Galen</hi> teacheth 3. <hi>de comp. med. ſec. loc. c.</hi> 1. but we may make conjecture from the precedent Cauſes and Circumſtances.</p>
                     <p>We conjecture that the noiſe comes from wind, becauſe ſomtimes it ceaſeth, and returneth again; as alſo when the Patient hath formerly uſed to eat windy meat.</p>
                     <p>It cometh by conſent from other parts, when there is ſome peculiar diſeaſe in them.</p>
                     <p>It appears to come from the Brain when pain and heavineſs of the Head went before, and when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſences alſo are hurt.</p>
                     <p>That the fault is in the Ears, appears by a continual noiſe without any intermiſſion.</p>
                     <p>We know that that Diſeaſe comes from a cold matter; if the Patient be better for the uſe of hot things, and if in time of health great noiſe be not much diſturbance.</p>
                     <p>The difference of ſounds above mentioned, do ſhew whether the diſeaſe comes of thick or thin, many or few vapors, it will eaſily appear by what hath been ſaid.</p>
                     <p>When it comes from the weakneſs of the faculty of hearing; as from ſome Diſeaſes aforegoing, of which the Pati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>We conjecture that it comes from a hot diſtemper, and from an exquiſite ſence coming thereupon, when the Patient perceiveth a heat in his head about his Ears; when ſome hot Cauſes went before, and Medicines that diſcuſs wind do encreaſe the diſeaſe: as alſo when the Patient in time of his health could not endure any great noiſe by reaſon of the exquiſitneſs of ſence.</p>
                     <p>As to the Prognoſtick: A new begun noiſe in the head is eaſily cured, but an old, hardly, and the more if it come from the French Pox. That which proceeds of a hot cauſe, is more eaſily cured than that which comes of a cold.</p>
                     <p>An old noiſe coming of flegm contained in the Ear, turneth to deafneſs; for when the matter is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, the paſſage of Hearing is ſtopped.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of this Diſeaſe is divers in reſpect of the diverſity of Cauſes.</p>

                     <p>But ſince al pain comes from the ſolution of Continuity, al thoſe things do cauſe pain in the Ears, which do diſſolve the Continuity of thoſe ſenſible parts which compaſs the Cavity of the Ear: the chief whereof are Diſtempers both without, and with, Matter, Wounds, Ulcers, or things fallen, or put into the Ears Externally.</p>
                     <p>A Cold Diſtemper doth ſomtimes cauſe pain in the Ears, and it comes from cold Winds, cold La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>A Hot Diſtemper without Matter, ſeldom or never produceth a pain in the Ears, as a cold doth: For Cold is an Enemy to theſe Nervous and Membranous parts, but Heat is a Friend to them. Nor can it cauſe any pain but that which is exceſſive, and wil cauſe a defluxion of Humors to the parts, and then it is not without Matter.

                     <p>Now the Cold Matter which cauſeth pain in the Ears is either flegm or water which comes from the Brain into them, or elſe wind coming from the Brain or the inferior parts.</p>
                     <p>But the Hot Matter, is either Choller that fals from the Veins and Arteries into thoſe parts, or Blood, from whence cometh Inflamation.</p>
                     <p>The afore aid Cauſe produceth an occult Solution of Continuity from whence cometh Pain. But manifeſt Solutions of Continuity, as Wounds and Ulcers, are more evident Cauſes of pain. Wounds come from external Punctures, Cuts, and Contuſions. But Ulcers come either after Inflamation and breaking of an Impoſtume, or from ſharp Humors that corrode the parts,</p>

                     <p>The Cure, as the Diagnoſtick and Prognoſtick, is to be varied according to the Cauſe.</p>

                     <p>If it come from a cold diſtemper with matter, as flegm, water, or wind, you muſt uſe the Medicines preſcribed in the cure of Deafneſs. Firſt, Purge the whol Body, then correct the diſtemper of the Brain, and apply warm Topicks that diſcuſs unto the Ears.</p>

                     <p>Inflamation of the Ear is cured firſt by blood-letting, according to the quantity of the humor, for revulſion of it from the Ears, firſt having given an emollient and cooling Clyſter: This muſt be done in great quantity, at divers times, for the greatneſs and violence of the Diſeaſe requires it. You muſt

open the Head Vein on that ſide the Ear is that is pained. If you think it comes from ſtoppage of Terms or Hemorrhoids, open the lower Veins, firſt having let blood in the Arm. When the cauſe is not from thence, it will do good for revulſion to apply Leeches.</p>
                     <p>Alſo you make good Revulſions by Frictions and Ligatures of the Arms and Thighs, by cupping the Shoulders and Back with Scarrification, or without.</p>
                     <p>Somtimes for Derivation it is good to apply Cupping glaſſes behind the Ears, with Scarrification; as <hi>Zacutus Lucitanus</hi> teacheth, <hi>Obſer. 64. lib. 1.

This worthy ſaying gave much help to a poor man which was in pain; and when al things failed, and he grew weak with watching, and mad with a continual Feaver, being rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to depart; having opened a Vein, and applied Cupping glaſſes to the Shoulders and Neck, and taken revelling Clyſters, and purging, and the like; as alſo Anodines into his Ear without any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, he was cured only with a Cupping glaſs with Scarification applied by the Glandles of the Ears, which drew much blood, and took away the inflamation.</p>

The way of doing it, is ſet down by us, in the Cure of the hot Head-ach.</p>
                     <p>A Purge againſt Choller is good, for ſo the Choller mixed with Blood, which by it is made ſo fluid, is drawn down, and ſent forth.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards the whol maſs of humors is to be tempered with cooling Juleps, made of the Decoction of Lettice, Purſlain, Plantane, Sorrel, and the like, with Syrup of Lemmons, Pomegranats, or wild Poppies.</p>
                     <p>In the mean while, theſe Medicines are given; you muſt alwaies apply Topicks, which muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies be Anodine, by reaſon of the vehemency of the pain, the mitigation whereof muſt be your chief intent; and this will be more rationally done, if in the beginning and the encreaſe of the Diſeaſe, you mix things that do gently repel; but in the ſtate and declination, things that reſolve, ſuch as theſe following:</p>

                     <p>The New Ulcer which is Simple, either comes of External Cauſe, as a Wound, or Contuſion: Or, from an Internal Cauſe, as the ſharpneſs of Humors, flowing to the part; &amp; eſpecially ſalt Flegm coming from the Brain.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ozaena</hi> cometh from a ſimple Ulcer neglected, or from the Malignity and Acrimony of the Cauſe by which it becometh putrid and filthy.</p>
                     <p>The Diagnoſis of both is this; a Simple Ulcer Cauſeth little or no pain, but only ſends forth blood often, eſpecially when it is meddled or tampered withal; otherwiſe is is covered with a dry black Scab which ſomtimes is caſt forth. But <hi>Ozaena</hi> Cauſeth great pain, the Scab is fouler; as alſo Stinking Matter cometh from it. The Patient is not only annoyed therewith, but noyſom unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: and the Greeks cal it <hi>Ozaena</hi> from the ſtink. Often this Ulcer creepeth, or either eateth the Griſtle of the Noſe, or the parts between, or the tender Bones thereof, and putrifie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

ſomtimes deſtroyeth the Pallat, eſpecially if it turn to a Cancer, or if it come from the French Pox as it often doth, or from an <hi>Elephantiaſis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſtick, Ulcers that are New, and come from a gentle Humor that hath little Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity are eaſily Cured: but Old Ulcers that are ſordid and putrid are hardly Cured, and if they turn into a Cancer, never. If they come of the French Pox, or Elephantiaſis, they cannot be Cured except thoſe Diſeaſes be firſt Cured.</p>
                     <p>For the Cure: Firſt you muſt appoint a good Diet, which may aſſwage the ſharpneſs of the Humors, and hinder the breeding of them; then you muſt Evacuate the whole Body by Bleeding, convenient Purging, and by Cupping Glaſſes with Scarrification: And if the Defluxion of Humors into the Noſtrils be very ſtubborn, it muſt be derived by Veſicatories and Cauſticks applied to the hinder parts, and then you muſt give things to ſtrengthen the head.</p>
                     <p>After Univerſal Remedies you muſt come to Topicks. And firſt take notice if the Ulcers be Cruſty and Hard. and before you proceed, take away that with a little warm water and freſh Butter, or Goo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The Scabs being mollified, muſt not preſently be taken off by force, leſt the Ulcer be exaſperated with a Defluxion; but you muſt expect til they fal off of their own accord by blowing the noſtrils; or at laſt you may take them gently off with a little Oyl of ſweet Almonds upon the tip of your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>After the Scab is off you muſt uſe aſtringent and drying Remedies.</p>
                     <p>In a Simple Ulcer it is ſufficient to waſh it with Barley water, and Honey of Roſes, and then to anoint it with Ointment of Tutty, or with the white Ointment of Rhaſis, or the Oyl of yolks of Egs which wil be of more ſorce if it be made in a Leaden Mortar.</p>

                     <p>THe Sence of Smelling is hindered and hurt three waies, as other Actions are, that is, by dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing, aboliſhing, and depraving.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes are the ſame that diminiſh, and aboliſh the Smelling, only they differ in degrees, namely, diſtemper, obſtruction, and aſtriction.</p>
                     <p>A cold and moiſt diſtemper joyned with flegm, as it can eaſily make any ſence dull, ſo doth it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially hinder the Smelling, or aboliſh it; hence it is that the Smelling is often hurt when there is a Catarrh, or a Coryza, for cold doth either diminiſh or aboliſh the ſence, becauſe it doth dull and we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ken the Natural heat, which is the producer of every action.</p>
                     <p>Obſtruction comes alſo from flegm which fills the ſenſible Paſſages, as the Noſtrils; and alſo the inſenſible; as the pores of the Brain, and the proceſſus of the Temples, called <hi>Mamillares,</hi> ſo that the ſcents and ſmels cannot come to the parts: it may alſo come of a Sarcoma, Polypus, or other cauſe filling and ſtopping the Noſtrils.</p>
                     <p>Aſtriction ſomtimes may come from flegm gathered in the fore part of the Brain, and compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the <hi>Proceſſus Mamillares,</hi> as we ſaid of the diminiſhing of ſight, from the aſtriction of the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Nerves. This aſtriction may alſo come from the Natural ſhape of the Noſtrils, when they are ſo ſtraight that there is no free paſſage for the Scents.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſe of Smelling depraved, is a ſtink alwaies coming to the Noſtrils, either from an Ulcer there, or from ſtinking flegm in the Noſtrils, and <hi>Os Et<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Moreover, a foul ſtinking vapor ariſing from other parts, as the Stomach, Jaws, and Brain be carried to the <hi>Proceſſus Mamillares,</hi> and ſo infect them, that all the ſcents that are brought thither ſhall ſmel thereof; as when the Tongue is foul with Choller, all things which you taſt ſeem bitter.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes are eaſily known. A cold and moiſt diſtemper of the Brain, and ſlimy flegm coming from the Brain, ſhew an abundance of flegm.</p>
                     <p>An obſtruction if it come from flegm ſhall be known by the ſame ſigns. If it come from Sarcoma or Polypus, you may learn the knowledg thereof from their Chapters.</p>
                     <p>Now the place in which the matter cauſing obſtruction is contained, is known thus: If it be in the paſſage of the Noſtrils, the voyce is hindered, becauſe the Noſtrils conduce to Speech: but the voyce is per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>You may know by the default of the parts, from whence comes the ſcent which hurts the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Smelling.</p>
                     <p>As to the Prognoſtick: When the Smelling is newly hurt, and coming of a ſimple Coryza or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxion, is eaſily cured; but when it is of long continuance, and from a ſetled diſtemper, hardly: that which comes from the ill ſhape of the Noſtrils, is incurable.</p>
                     <p>You muſt order the Cure diverſly according to the diverſity of the Cauſes: If it come from a cold

                     <p>For the taking away of the Obſtruction or ſtopping of the Noſtrils and Proceſſus Mamillares by flegm faſtened there; You muſt uſe Medicines that Purge thoſe parts, as Errhins, Neezings, and Gargariſms; which were propounded by us in the Cure of the Cold Diſtemper of the Brain.</p>
                     <p>If the Noſtrils be ſtopt by a Sarcoma or Polypus; you muſt fetch the Cure from the Precedent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chapter.</p>

                        <hi>Chap. 4.</hi> Of the Stink of the Noſtrils.</head>
                     <p>THe Stink of the Noſtrils, and of the Breath, do much differ; for that comes only from the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils, and this from divers parts, as from the Stomach, Lungs, Gums, Jaws, or being Ulcera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which you may know by ſenſe, or by their proper ſigns.</p>
                     <p>But the ſtink in the Noſtrils comes of ſtinking Vapors either bred in the Noſtrils, as in <hi>Ozaena, Sarcoma</hi> or <hi>Polypus:</hi> or ſent thither from putrid Humors contained in the fore-part of the Brain; or about the <hi>Proceſſus Mamillares,</hi> or <hi>Os Cribroſum.</hi> Now the Humors do putrifie in the ſaid parts when they are too long retained in them, eſpecially if the Brain be hot and moiſt; and they are retained either by the ſtoppage or aſtriction of the parts, and in flat Noſes.</p>
                     <p>The Diſeaſes of the Noſtrils which produce this ſtink, are known by their proper ſigns above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; but if you find none, you muſt conjecture that the ſtink comes from a putrid Humor in the Brain, <hi>Proceſſus Mamillares,</hi> or <hi>Os Cribroſum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Prognoſtick of the ſtink in the Noſe coming of an Ulcer, <hi>Polypus,</hi> or <hi>Sarcoma,</hi> depends upon their Frognoſtick: but that which comes from corrupt Humors contained in the fore-part of the Brain, if it be New, is eaſily Cured; if Old, uncurable: eſpecially if it come from a depreſſion and flatneſs of the Noſe.</p>
                     <p>The Cure is performed by removing the Cauſes, and appeaſing the Symptoms.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of an Ulcer, Sarcoma, and Polypus is above mentioned: but you muſt take away the putrid Humor in the Brain, <hi>Proceſſus Mamillares,</hi> or <hi>Os Ethmoides,</hi> by emptying and Clenſing means.</p>
                     <p>And firſt, You muſt uſe Univerſal Evacuations for Clenſing the whol body and the brain from flegmy Excrements, by Pills, Apozems, and the like; to which you may ad, if there be great plenty of Humors, a Sweating Diet: afterwards adminiſter Errhins that clenſe and bring forth the Matter conjoined.</p>
                     <p>And firſt of al, Let him morning and evening ſnuff up white Wine from the palm of his hand in which the Leſſer Centaury and Calamints have been boyled.</p>
                     <p>Then let the juyce of Beets extracted with the Water of Marjoram be uſed in like manner.</p>

                        <hi>COryza,</hi> called in Latin, <hi>Gravedo,</hi> is a Catarrh falling from the Brain into the Noſe; which Defluxion is of a crude Humor contained in the fore Ventricles of the Brain, and comes for the moſt or an External Cauſe, as from the heat of the Sun, drinking of much Wine, hot Baths, and the like, which do melt and diſſolve the thick flegm gathered in the Brain: It comes alſo of External Cauſes which Cool the Brain, for then it is ſqueezed like a ſpunge, and ſo it ſends down the Humor into the inferior parts: as alſo by over-cooling the Brain there is an encreaſe of flegm, for through
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:49088:70"/>
want of heat the Excrements are not concocted; therefore are they ſent forth through the open paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages by the Expulſive Faculty.</p>
                     <p>This Diſeaſe appears of its ſelf, for the Humor is ſent in abundance out of the Noſe.</p>
                     <p>Among al kinds of Catarrhs that which is through the Noſe is moſt ſafe and gentle, eaſily Cured if it be New, and come of an External Cauſe; but that which is Old, and comes from a ſtubborn Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper of the Brain, is difficult.</p>
                     <p>As alſo, when it proceeds of a hot Diſtemper of the Liver, which ſomtimes cauſeth ſharp and hot Catarrhs; by which the Noſe is often Ulcerated and ill affected otherwaies.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of this Diſeaſe is by Curing the Catarrh; for it requires the ſame Evacuations, Revulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Derivations; except that here you muſt not uſe Errhins, leſt they ſhould draw the Humors to the part affected; but Gargariſms and Maſticatories after Univerſals are very good.</p>
                     <p>And beſides theſe, Authors do commend thoſe things which properly belong to the ſtopping of a Cataarh; as the vapor of boyled Marjoram; or of Marjoram water taken into the Noſe. The fume of Vinegar ſprinkled upon a red hot Iron is good for the ſame; and the better if red Roſes have formerly been infuſed therein: If the Defluxion be very Cold, dry Fumigations of Nigella, Frankinſence, and the like, thrown upon Embers are very good; for by theſe the cold Diſtemper of the Brain is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, and the ſuperfluous moiſture conſumed.</p>

                     <p>ALthough Neezing come often to ſound men, and uſeth to be ſo light an Affect that it deſerveth not the name of a Symptom; yet ſomtimes it is troubleſom, that it requireth a Phyſitian: As we may reade in <hi>Foreſtus, Obſ. 127. Lib.</hi> 10. in his Hiſtory of a certain Maid which had ſo grievous a fit of Neezing from a ſharp ſalt Catarrh, that ſhe had the advice of many Phyſitians. This is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Old Cuſtom of ſaying <hi>God bleſs you</hi> to him that Neezeth; which ſome ſay came from hence, In the time of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great there was an ordinary Diſeaſe of Neezing by which the Patients died; albeit ſome ſay that Cuſtom is more antient.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sternutation</hi> is a ſwift motion of the Brain, with which the breath is forced out of the Noſe for the throwing forth of things that offend: By the Brain we underſtand not only the ſubſtance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but the whole Body with its Membranes; eſpecially the fore-membranes, which are eſpecially contracted in this Diſeaſe, which we may gather from hence, becauſe when we hold up the head we Neez more eaſily; for then the matter provoking which for the moſt part is windy and tends natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upwards, is more eaſily carried to that part.</p>
                     <p>But the motion which happens in Neezing belongs to the natural Expulſive Faculty of the Brain and its Membranes, according to <hi>Galen, 2. de ſymp. cauſ. cap.</hi> 1. where diſtinguiſhing Neezing from Trembling and Palpitation, ſaith, That Palpitation comes only from a Diſeaſe: Trembling from Nature and a Diſeaſe: but Neezing from Nature only.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Galen</hi> at the firſt ſight ſeems to contradict himſelf; who in <hi>Cap.</hi> 4. of the ſame Book, ſaith, That a Cough and Neezing are Symptoms of the Voluntary Faculty; but it is no contradiction: and <hi>Galen</hi> cleers himſelf wiſely; ſaying, That in Neezing the Animal Faculty doth concur only ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarily; becauſe in Neezing breath is ſent from the Head and from the Lungs; yet the Head gives the original of the motion to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>reaſt; for when it haſtneth to ſend forth thoſe things that offend in the Noſe, it uſeth both wayes at once to ſend forth breath: One way which it maketh by it ſelf, Another way which it maketh by the Nerves, deſcending like long arms into the breaſt; whence <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, Com. Aph. 51. Sect.</hi> 7. teacheth, That Neezing comes with antecedent inſpiration or taking in of breath when Nature gathers it together to make Sternutation, then the air which goes forth of the breaſt, joyned with that which is drawn by the Noſe into the Brain, doth expel with Noiſe and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence whatſoever offendeth the Membranes of the Noſtrils which have moſt Exquiſite Senſe.</p>
                     <p>From this place of <hi>Galen,</hi> we may gather, That the irritation which cauſeth Sternutation is made chiefly in the Noſe; which is confirmed, <hi>Aph. 51. lib.</hi> 7. where he ſaith, <hi>They only Neez of thoſe thus Affected which have a ſharp moiſture flowing from the head, as when you put ſharp things into the Noſe: For as a Cough is a certain natural motion to purge the Arteries which are in the Lungs; ſo doth Neezing the paſſages of the Noſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But it may be objected, That many ſtanding bare-headed, or otherwiſe in the cold Air, do preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Neez, that one would think the Brain was provoked immediatly at that time. We <hi>Anſwer,</hi> That cold Air is the Cauſe of Sternutation not while it doth immediately act upon the brain: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe through compreſſion of the brain and its Membranes, it cauſeth a ſharp Matter to deſcend to the Noſtrils; although therefore in this Symptom the Membranes of the brain may be provoked: yet
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:49088:71"/>
Neezing is not produced before a ſharpneſs or tickling come to the Membranes of the Noſe which are exquiſitely ſenſible.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes of Neezings are known by what hath been ſaid, namely, What things ſoever can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the internal coat of the Noſtrils, ſuch as are ſharp humors or vapors, either coming from the Brain, or ſent from the inferior parts; hence men neez in feavers, ſaith <hi>Avicen,</hi> becauſe ſharp vapors are ſent from the whol body into the head; or it is cauſed when ſharp things are externally put into the Noſe, as ſharp Medicines called <hi>Ptarmica</hi> Neeſings. Theſe are the external Cauſes which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke neezing immediately. There are many other mediate Cauſes which make internal Cauſes, or move them, as all alterations of the Air, as above ſaid of cold Air. <hi>Galen</hi> in his Book <hi>de inſtrum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> odoratus, cap.</hi> 6. ſaith, That neezing is provoked by beholding the Sun, becauſe the Spirits of the Brain, like to a vapor, are diſcuſſed by the Sun.</p>
                     <p>The knowledg of this Diſeaſe is manifeſt. The outward Cauſes appear by the relation of the Patient; but the internal from the ſigns of the parts affected, by which the matter provoking is ſent to the Noſtrils, and fore part of the Brain.</p>
                     <p>As to the Prognoſtick; This Diſeaſe is of it ſelf without danger. But in the beginning of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrh or Coryza it is very hurtful, becauſe it keeps the humor from concoction by its motion. Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in Feavers it is ſo ſtrong that it takes away all ſtrength, and cauſeth bleeding at the Noſe; ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is no waies hurtful, and in ſound men it expelleth the ſuperfluities of the Brain: In ſick men it is held a good ſign. It promiſeth help in Feavers, eſpecially in malignant Feavers when all things are deſperate. If neezing happen to a woman in fits of the Mother, or that hath hard travel, it is good, Aph. 35. Sect. 5. Neezing provoked with Medicines is good againſt Apoplexies, and other great Diſeaſes of the Brain. And if being provoked they do not neez, it is a ſign of death, for it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth that Nature leaves to act.</p>
                     <p>In Diſeaſes of the Lungs, eſpecially in a Pleuriſie, and <hi>Peripneumonia,</hi> or inflamation of the Lungs, neezing is evil, <hi>Hipp. 2. Progn.</hi> becauſe from the ſhaking of the Brain in neezing, the parts of the Breaſt are violently pulled and torn; from whence the inflamation is encreaſed, and there is no other evacuation of the matter cauſing the diſeaſe; but for the expelling of flegm contained in the Griſtles of the Lungs, which could not be caſt out by a Cough: <hi>Galen</hi> ſheweth that neezing is good, <hi>Gal. 2. de ſymp. cauſ. cap. 5, &amp;</hi> 6.</p>
                     <p>The Cure when it is neceſſary, or when neezing bringeth inconveniencies, is made firſt by remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the External Cauſes, if it come from them. If it come of an internal Cauſe, you muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move that alſo, by Evacuations, Revellers, Derivers, and Diſcuſſers.</p>
                     <p>If a hot diſtemper of the Brain or any other part ſend ſharp vapors to the Noſtrils and inward Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninges. Then you muſt open a Vein, and then purge, then revel the vapors with Frictions, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatures, with Cupping Glaſſes to the Shoulders; alſo uſe other Revelling, Deriving, and Diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Medicines, comb the Head, pull the Ears, rub the Eyes, blow the Noſe, and hold the Breath.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, To take away ſharpneſs, and hinder the Noſtrils from being provoked, it is good to take the vapor of hot water into the Noſe; or to anoint the Noſtrils with Oyl of Roſes, ſweet Almonds, Violets, or with freſh Butter; or to ſnuff up warm Milk into the Noſe; by which only Remedy <hi>Foreſtus</hi> preſently cured the Maid mentioned formerly.</p>

                     <p>An <hi>Haemorrhagia</hi> of the Noſe, is a Symptome in the excrements of thoſe things which are wholly againſt Nature. For Blood coming through the Noſe, either comes from the Veins and Arteries in the Brain, or from the Veſſels coming from the Pallat to the Noſtrils, which ate like the Hemorrhoid Veins in the Womb and Fundament.</p>
                     <p>But ſince every Symptome depends upon a Diſeaſe as its immediate Cauſe, the cauſe of this will be either an Organical, or a Common Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>The Organical is two-fold: The opening of the Veſſels, which is called in Greek <hi>Anaſtomoſis;</hi> and the thinning, or rarefaction of them, called <hi>Diapedeſis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Common Diſeaſe is two-fold: The breaking of the Veſſels, called <hi>Rexis;</hi> and the Eroſion called <hi>Diabroſis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Cauſes immediately producing thoſe Diſeaſes, are either exceeding in quantity or quality of Blood.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="115" facs="tcp:49088:71"/>Blood offending in quantity can either break the Veins, or open the Orifices of them.</p>
                     <p>In quality, if it be too hot, or too thin, it will flow out by <hi>Anaſtomoſis,</hi> becauſe heat doth dilate the Orifice, and thinneſs maketh it flow more eaſily. Alſo the ſame qualities make a <hi>Diapedeſis:</hi> for heat maketh the coats of the Veſſels thin, and the thinneſs of the blood makes it eaſie to paſs through the pores of thoſe coats.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, The ſharpneſs of the Blood gnaweth the Tunicles of the Veins, and ulcerateth them, from whence cometh a <hi>Diabroſis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The external Cauſes alſo do concur to produce this Diſeaſe, either mediately, or immediately.</p>
                     <p>Immediately, as falls, ſtroaks, wounds, and the like, which break and divide the Veins.</p>
                     <p>They work mediately which do encreaſe, warm, and make thin the blood, as plentiful Diet, Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, Idleneſs, too much Exerciſe, great Noiſe, Heat, long ſtaying in the Sun, and the like.</p>
                     <p>The Differences of <hi>Hemorrhagia</hi> are theſe: Some are Critical, ſome Symptomatical.</p>
                     <p>Critical <hi>Hemorrhagia's</hi> are in acute Feavers, by the force of Nature endeavor to expel the cauſe of the Diſeaſe this way, as eſpecially in thoſe Diſeaſes which are joyned with the Inflamation of ſome Entral, eſpecially of the Liver, or the Spleen, which are many times diſcharged by theſe waies; ſomtimes it comes without a Feaver, when Nature diſchargeth her ſelf of the ſuperfluous blood, whence we ſee many in their youth have an Hemorrhagy by fits, and others bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ed other waies.</p>
                     <p>A Symptomatical Haemorrhagy happeneth chiefly in Chronical Diſeaſes, in which filthy blood is produced by reaſon of the debility of the Liver, or ſome other great Diſtemper, which either flows through thoſe Veins by the weakneſs of the retentive faculty, or is ſent forth by the expulſive, as an unprofitable burden, becauſe impure blood is not fit to nouriſh the Body.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Haemorrhagia</hi> is known of its ſelf. But its Cauſes are thus diſtinguiſhed: That which cometh by <hi>Anaſtomoſis,</hi> hath this common with that which comes by <hi>Rexin,</hi> or rupture, in that in both the blood floweth plentifully; but in this they are diſtinguiſhed, If a blow or a fall went before, we ſhould ſuppoſe it to be <hi>Rexin:</hi> But when Ruption cometh from <hi>Plethora,</hi> or much Blood; as alſo apertion of the Veins; thus they may be diſtinguiſhed: When the Veſſel is broken, the Blood ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth conſtantly; when it is opened, at a diſtance, and by fits only; becauſe the Orifices of the Veſſels uſe to be knit and cloſed when there is leſs plenty of the Humor which dilateth flowing thereto; but broken Veſſels ſtand alwaies open, and therefore blood continually ſloweth till the ſolution of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity be united. Moreover the opening of a Vein, is diſtinguiſhed from the breaking, by the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the blood: For if it be thin, it comes from a Veſſel opened; if thick, it comes from a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Hence it is that Hemorrhagy comes in yong men for the moſt part by the opening of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, becauſe their blood is thin; but in old men from Ruption, becauſe theirs is thick.</p>
                     <p>If it comes from Ero<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>on of the Veins, there will be ſigns of <hi>Cacochymia,</hi> or ill juyce in the body of an Ulcer, and matter ſomtimes comes forth: or at leaſt a ſalt Catarrh hath gone before. If it comes by <hi>Diapedeſis,</hi> or Rarefaction, the blood is thin and little.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes autecedent and external, are eaſily diſtinguiſhed: For if it come from plenty of blood, there is a red face and large veins: as alſo the Diet hath been large and hot, or there hath been ſome external cauſe which hath melted and made thin the blood, and theſe eſpecially befal them who have very hot Livers.</p>
                     <p>If it come from evil Juyce, it is known by its proper ſigns, which declare whether Choller or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly doth abound: Moreover, the Blood will appear corrupt either from the Noſe, or taken from the Arm.</p>
                     <p>If it come from the weakneſs of the retentive faculty, the face wil be pale, and the whol body weak; as alſo ſome Diſeaſe hath gone before, by which the Liver was firſt weakened, and then very little blo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> comes forth, and by degrees.</p>
                     <p>If the blood comes immediately from the Veins of the Noſtrils, it is eaſily ſtopt with aſtringent Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines applied thereto, and there will be no pain in the Head. Contrary wiſe, if it come from the Brain, there is ſome pain in ſome part of the Head, the flux is hardly ſtopped, and things put up into the Noſe do no good. Somtimes blood comes from other parts, as the Liver, Spleen, Womb, whoſe ſigns are the pains and extenſions in thoſe parts.</p>
                     <p>If the blood flows from an Artery, it comes with force, it is hot, pure, freſh, and clear; but when it comes from a Vein, it is dark, red, thick, ſomtimes foul, and comes forth with ſmal force.</p>
                     <p>The Prognoſtick of Hemorrhagy coming, eſpecially if it be Critical, is taken from the hurt actions, when the Excrements and qualities are changed: as watchings, and dreams of red things, a great pain of the Head and Neck, heavineſs in the Temples, and great beating of thoſe Arteries, ringing and noiſe in the Ears, dulneſs of the Eyes, with redneſs thereof, and of the whol face, hating of light, invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary tears, itching of the Noſe, a drop of Blood upon the day that declares the Criſis, difficulty of breathing, an extenſion of the Hypochondria without pain.</p>
                     <p>The Reaſon of which ſigns is: When the Blood begins to be carried to the Head, it begets in the Head Phantaſms of red things, both waking and ſleeping: as it happened to a yong Roman which
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:49088:72"/>
                        <hi>Galen</hi> mentioneth, <hi>lib. de praeſag. ad Poſthumum, cap.</hi> 13. he had an acute Diſeaſe, and thought he ſaw a red Serpent about the Chamber Seiling, at which being frighted, he leaped out of his bed: Hence <hi>Galen</hi> foretold a Haemorrhagy at hand, and hindered the letting of blood which other Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans had preſcribed.</p>
                     <p>The pain of the Head and Neck comes from the tranſlation of the blood into the ſuperior parts, which by diſtending and pulling the Membranes cauſeth pain.</p>
                     <p>The Arteries in the Temples beat by reaſon of their compreſſion which is cauſed by the fulneſs of the Veins.</p>
                     <p>The noiſe in the Ears comes from vapors flying in abundance into the head.</p>
                     <p>The ſight is dim becauſe many thick vapors ſent up do ſtop the paſſages. Hence it is that when paſſage is denied to the Animal Spirits, the ſight is dim.</p>
                     <p>The things flying before the Eyes called <hi>Marmaryges,</hi> are nothing but thin bodies divided and of divers colours contained between the <hi>Cornea</hi> and the <hi>Cryſtalline,</hi> coming from vapors aſcending: which though they be inward, yet through deception of the ſight they ſeem to be outward; becauſe the Eye being uſed to ſee External things, ſuppoſeth whatſoever is within, to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</p>
                     <p>The Redneſs of the Face and Eyes comes from blood in thoſe parts increaſed: there is a deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of light, becauſe the Eyes being diſtended with plenty of humors, wil be more diſtended with light, becauſe it diſperſeth the Spirits: Hence the Eye is dilated, which cauſeth pain, which that the Patient may avoid, he avoideth the light.</p>
                     <p>The involuntary Tears come from the repletion of the Eyes, and the parts adjacent, which being too much Diſtended to preſs the Glandles that contain the moiſture of which tears are made.</p>
                     <p>The Itching of the Noſtrils comes from vapors aſcending upwards.</p>
                     <p>Drops of blood upon the day of demonſtration, namely, the fourth or eleventh, ſheweth that there wil be an <hi>Haemorrhagy</hi> upon the day of judgment; namely, the ſeventh or the fourteenth, becauſe in thoſe dayes Nature begins to transfer the Humors to thoſe parts.</p>
                     <p>The breathing is difficult, becauſe while the blood flyeth upward it compreſſeth the <hi>Diaphrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, There is a ſtretching of the <hi>Hypochondria,</hi> becauſe the blood begins to move in its foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and in the roots of the veins: but this diſtention is not conſtant, and is without pain, as the difficulty of breathing is: for if they ſhould laſt long and increaſe they would be ſigns of the Liver inflamed.</p>
                     <p>The Prognoſtick of a preſent Bleeding at Noſe is thus.</p>
                     <p>If Blood flow moderately out of the Noſe in the day of judgment it is ſign of Health; although <hi>Galen</hi> doth confirm this; yet <hi>Fernelius</hi> denyeth it, ſaying, <hi>lib. 2. de ſanguinis m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ſſ. cap.</hi> 1. That no diſcharge of blood, although critical, is ſign of health; for though it eaſe madneſs, watchings, head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach, and other Symptoms, yet it ſcarce ever cureth the Diſeaſe, becauſe the purer portion of blood is ſent forth and the pure remaineth; and this is thus proved, becauſe the blood coming from the noſe is of a laudable colour and ſubſtance, when blood at the ſame time taken out of a vein in the arm or elſe where, ſhal appear to be corrupt.</p>
                     <p>This Doctrine of <hi>Fernelius</hi> is very real, but not altogether to be received: It is true, That in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Diſeaſes, eſpecially malignant Feavers, a <hi>Haemorrhag</hi> doth not alwaies Cure the Diſeaſe: as Sweat is not alwaies a ſign of Health in thoſe Diſeaſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe theſe Evacuations being forced by Nature before the time, come for the moſt part from the malice of the matter of the Diſeaſe: Yet ſomtimes acute Diſeaſes are cured by <hi>Haemorrhagia,</hi> as <hi>Galen</hi> taught in his Third Book <hi>de criſ. cap. ult.</hi> and elſewhere. And the reaſon why blood out of the Noſtrils is alwaies pure, is becauſe it comes by drops, and therefore would be ſo quickly cold that the impure parts could not be ſeparated; and the purer parts mixed with the reſt would make the whol maſs red. But blood taken out of the arm, becauſe it comes flowing freely, keeps the colour long in the veſſel from which the impure parts are ſeparated, ſo that the thick and droſly part goes to the bottom, but the choller and flegm which is more altered and impure, ſwims at the top, and ſo the blood ſeems impure and ſordid.</p>
                     <p>On the other ſide, if blood ſhould drop from the vein it would appear pure, becauſe it preſently goes together before the <hi>Haeterogeneal</hi> parts can be divided by the heat; nay if blood flow freely and be caught in a large veſſel, it wil appear pure becauſe it is quickly cold.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Haemorrhagyes</hi> that are very great are the worſt, for they tend to a Convulſion: For ſomtimes it comes to paſs that Nature being burdened with much blood, and ſtirred up to throw it forth, cannot obſerve a Mean, and makes an over Criſis, which Phyſitians muſt ſtop.</p>
                     <p>An <hi>Haemorrhagy</hi> in the beginning of the Diſeaſe is evil, becauſe it is Symptomatical, and comes from the malignity of the matter of the Diſeaſe, Nature being ſtirred up to ſend it forth before her time.</p>

                     <p>A few drops coming from the Noſe are evil: for it ſignifies the weakneſs of nature, and the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>For al Excretions are condemned by <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> in acute diſeaſes if they be begun only and not finiſhed, becauſe there is greater ſecurity in thoſe Feavers in which nature putteth forth nothing, than in which ſhe puts forth little to no profit.</p>
                     <p>For then it is to be ſuppoſed that ſhe tends to Concoction; but if a drop appear, it is a ſign that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was ſtirred up before her time.</p>
                     <p>But a drop coming upon the day of Indication, and ſigns of Concoction alſo appearing, it ſignifies that there wil be an Haemorrhagy upon that Critical day.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Haemorrhagies</hi> continuing long, foreſhews the weakneſs of the Liver, and the coldneſs alſo, and an evil habit with a dropſie to be at hand.</p>
                     <p>To him who have bled at the noſe in Quartane Feavers it is evil, <hi>Hippocrates, Aph. 87. Sect.</hi> 7. For as <hi>Avicen</hi> ſayeth bleeding in Melancholly and Flegmatick people is hurtful, becauſe i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> cooleth too much.</p>
                     <p>To them who in Feavers have loſt much blood at the Noſe, or any part, when they amend their belly wil be looſe, <hi>Hip. aph. 27. ſect.</hi> 4. For as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith in <hi>Com.</hi> when the natural heat is debilitated by bleeding, neither can their meat be wel concocted, nor turned into blood, nor diſtributed into the body: and therefore it is fit they ſhould be looſe bellied, until Nature recover her ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>In the Cure of <hi>Haemorrhagia,</hi> firſt obſerve whether it be Critical or Symptomatical: For a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical is not to be ſtopped, but you muſt ſuffer it to flow in a great quantity: For <hi>Avicen</hi> ſaith, That blood hath come from the Noſe to the quantity of four pints by a Criſis without any decay of ſtrength. And this ſeems to be taken out of <hi>Galen,</hi> who in his Book <hi>de Progn ad Poſthum. cap.</hi> 13. ſuffered a yong Roman to bleed four pints and an half before he would ſtop it.</p>
                     <p>Which as it may fal out wel in very Plethorick people, ſo in others it may endanger life; and it is certain that a Critical Haemorrhagy, although it is the work of Nature, yet ſomtimes is beyond mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; for Nature being burdened with blood, and ſtirred up to expel it, ſomtimes cannot keep with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in meaſure, but maketh too great an Evacuation; whence we ought to fear a great dejection of ſtrength, and death, and then it is to be ſtopt, as often as any notable infirmity followeth.</p>
                     <p>So alſo that blood which cuſtomarily floweth without a Feaver is not to be ſtopped, but to be left to Natures ordering, except it be immoderate; for many by ſuch bleeding have been freed from great Diſeaſes, into which after, upon ſuppreſſion thereof they have fallen.</p>
                     <p>But a Symptomatical Hemorrhagy is to be ſtopt, which may be done by revulſion of the Blood from the Noſe, and by repelling it to the parts adjacent, by ſtopping of the Veins which are open, by ſtaying the diſorderly motion of the blood, and by evacuating the ſharp and thin humors mixed with the Blood, which are the chief Cauſe of Haemorrhagy, by correcting them, and hindering their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and by ſtrengthening the retentive faculty of the Liver and Veins: All which may be done with the Remedies following.</p>
                     <p>And firſt Blood-letting is the chief thing for Revulſion, which muſt be done quickly before the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient grow we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But it muſt be taken in a large quantity if the Patient be ſtrong, and from a large orifice: Although moſt of the Ancient and Modern Phyſitians think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But that you may make the blood move the contrary way, you muſt have a ſtronger motion for hinderance of a weaker; therefore by how much the larger the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and the more violent the motion is of the blood from the Vein opened, by ſo much the ſooner will the blood at the Noſe be ſtopped: But if by once letting blood, and applying other Remedies, the Haemorrhagy be not ſtopt, you muſt repeat Blood-letting according to the ſtrength of the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. You may alſo open the Vein in the Foot, that a Revulſion may be made at a great diſtance, which alſo availeth much, as <hi>Avicen, Paul.</hi> and <hi>Trallian</hi> ſay.</p>
                     <p>After Blood-letting, as alſo before, rub and bind the extream parts, and clap great Cup-glaſſes to the Hypochondria; to the right ſide, if the right No ſtril; to the left, if the left do bleed: For <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> ſtopt an Hemorrhagy in a yong Roman, by a Cupping-glaſs to the Hypochondrion without blood-letting, as he ſaith <hi>lib. de prog. ad Poſthum. cap.</hi> 13.</p>

Of which there is an example in <hi>Fabricius Hildanus, Obſ. 47.

Therefore you muſt be wary in applying Cupping-glaſſes to the Hypochondria, and never uſe them but when all other Remedies fail, and after divers Phlebotomies: For after the plenty of blood is taken out of the Veins, there is leſs danger of attracting too much Blood to the Liver to inflame it, but which way ſoever they are applied, they draw blood and ſpirits to thoſe parts whereby their heat is encreaſed, which ſeems to be contrary to the opinion of <hi>Hippocrates.</hi> Aph. 13. Sect. 5. where he ſaith, That in thoſe parts from whence Blood cometh, or is about to come, you muſt uſe cold things. The Interpreters ſay, that cold things are to be applied to thoſe parts from whence the motion of the Blood beginneth, as the Liver and Spleen.</p>

                     <p>But the Blood and Spirits are drawn inwardly more ſtrongly by ſwouning, whereby we ſaw a Biſhop in the year, 1629 cured of a violent Hemorrhagy; for being in a malignant Feaver with the inflamation of the right Cidney, which after in the twenty ſeventh day of his ſickneſs, turned to an Impoſthume, he was taken with ſo violent a bleeding, that in four hours he loſt two pounds, and ſtill bleeding and ſtrength decaying, we bethought how we ſhould ſtop it; and after the uſe of many remedies to no purpoſe, the Patient deſired to eaſe his belly, and could not be compelled to do it in his bed: we foretold him, that if he aroſe, he being very weak would faint away, but that would be good to ſtay his bleeding: and ſo it came to paſs, for after he roſe he ſwouned; from which with a little Wine he was recovered, throwing alſo Water in his face; after that he had a large ſtool was brought to his bed, and bled with leſs violence; then giving a dram and an half of Lapis Prunellae in cold Water, preſently the blood franched when the ſame and other Medicines could not formerly do it. Although fainting be not vulgarly accounted a Remedy againſt bleeding at the Noſe, yet <hi>Hipp. lib. 3. Epid.

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:49088:73"/>
ſuch as are vulgarly called <hi>Anacollemata,</hi> things to be applied to the Forehead and Temples, which are thus made:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Bole-Armenick, Terra Sigillata, Sanguis Draconis, Frankinſence, Maſtick, and Aloes, of each one dram: Bran and the hair of an Hare cut ſmal, of each half a dram: one white of an Egg, the Juyce of Plantane, and Nightſhade, of each as much as is ſufficient to make a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſm for the Forehead, and the Temples.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In extremity you may quickly make a Cataplaſm of Bole-Armenick only, mixed with the white of an Egg and Vinegar for the ſame parts.</p>
                     <p>The moſt excellent is made of Time and Vinegar, and applied to the Temples and the Forehead as thick as two fingers: and if the firſt application do it not, let it be repeated, and it will certainly cure.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Amatus Luſitanus</hi> commends a cap made with the aforeſaid Pouders, mixed with Vinegar and Water, laid upon the Head being ſhaven; which you may try in great extremity.</p>
                     <p>Alſo you may make a Fomentation of very cold Water, or Water and Vinegar to the Temples and Forehead, changing your cloaths as they grow hot.</p>
                     <p>Or you may make a Fomentation of the Juyce of Plantane, Knotgraſs, Horſ-tail, Shepheards<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purſe, and the like, with a little Vinegar to make it pierce. Where mark, That the Head is not to be waſhed with cold Water, nor repelling Medicines to be laid to the Forehead, before you have made ſufficient Revulſions; otherwiſe the blood being ſtruck in with cooling wil fill the Veins above, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſheweth, 5. meth. cap. 6. and ſo the flux will be encreaſed, by the heat encreaſed through <hi>Antiperiſtaſis,</hi> by which the motion and force of the blood is encreaſed; or if the blood be ſtopt, there will follow a Convulſion, Apoplexy, ſhort and difficult breathing, called <hi>Dyſpnoea,</hi> or the like.</p>
                     <p>Vinegar alone will ſtop blood if the Forehead be fomented therewith in a Spunge.</p>
                     <p>Or if you dip a Spunge in Vinegar, and put it into the Noſe.</p>
                     <p>To throw cold Water in the Face, doth not only drive back the blood, but alſo draweth inward by fear, if done on a ſudden, and unawares. As a ſyncope or ſwouning, as we ſaid before, ſtancheth blood by the retraction of it inward; by the ſame reaſon doth fear alſo. A great quantity, namely, two or three glaſſes muſt be caſt into the face divers times in a ſhort time.</p>
                     <p>Ordinarily they uſe to hinder the aſcent of the Blood with fomenting of the Neck with a cloth dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in cold Vinegar and bound about the Neck, changed often before it turn warm.</p>
                     <p>Vinegar and Water held in the mouth, doth drive the blood down, and keeps the blood from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into the Throat.</p>
                     <p>Alſo Vinegar put into the Ear next to the Noſtril bleeding, is good to cloſe the Vein.</p>
                     <p>A Bean, or piece of money bound to the root of the Noſe, between the Eyebrows, ſtoppeth the flux.</p>
                     <p>Alſo you muſt obſerve if the Veins or Arteries in the Forehead or Temples do ſwell, for then you muſt bind them down with Money, or a dry Bean ſlit in length, and this is a ſpecial Remedy. And for the better Compreſſion, you muſt lay a Pledget dipt in the white of an Eg beaten with Time, upon the Bean or Money.</p>
                     <p>The ſume of Vinegar ſprinkled upon a hot Iron, taken into the Noſtrils, will cloſe the opened Veins.</p>
                     <p>As alſo Vinegar and Water often ſnuffed up.</p>
                     <p>Beſides thoſe things which repel, we muſt uſe things that cloſe and glutinate the Veins. For which end, many Remedies may be put into the Noſe.</p>

                     <p>Or you may make a Tent thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Frankinſence, Aloes, Dragons blood, Bran, Cobwebs, and the hair of an Hare cut ſmal, of each half a dram, made up in a Tent with juyce of Plantane.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſame Pouders may be blown into the Noſe. For which purpoſe alſo great Practitioners do commend the pouder of Eg ſhels burnt, and burnt Paper. But you muſt remember beſides the uſe of theſe pouders, at the ſame time to fill the mouth with cold Water leſt the Medicine get into the mouth.</p>
                     <p>The Cotton of an Ink-horn ſqueezed a little, and made into a tent, doth powerfully ſtop.</p>

                     <p>If it yet continue, you muſt come to Eſcharoticks, which by burning the mouths of the Veins pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a Scab, and ſo ſtay the blood. But theſe muſt be uſed warily, for when the Eſchar falls off, they will bleed again.</p>
                     <p>Burnt Vitriol is the beſt, which beſides its Eſcharotick quality, is good to ſtanch blood.</p>
                     <p>If you will make it gentle, you muſt mix other Medicines thus:</p>

                     <p>Take of <hi>Conſerve of Roſes and Quinces, of each one ounce: the Troches of Spodium, or burm Ivory, and Terra Sigillata, of each one dram: Coral prepared, and burnt Harts-horn, of each one ſcruple.

                     <p>Vinegar and Water called Oxycrate, drunk plentifully ſtaies an Hemorrhagy.</p>
                     <p>Outwardly to cool the blood, and to hinder its motion, you muſt apply cold Water, or Water and Vinegar to divers parts, powring it upon the Arms, and putting the feet therein, and applying to the Cods, as alſo to the back, becauſe the <hi>Vena Càva</hi> runs that way, and ſo the blood will be cooled when it is exceeding hot, when the aforeſaid Medicines cannot remedy, ſome wet the whol Body with Vinegar and Water, or put him into cold Water, which is not without danger, when the Patient is weak.</p>
                     <p>It is excellent to temper the heat of the blood, to lay Epithems to the Liver and Spleen made of warm Vinegar and Water.</p>
                     <p>Finally, In the moſt deſperate Caſe, when no Medicines will prevail, you muſt uſe Narcoticks, or Stupefactives, which preſently ſtop all fluxes and evacuations and motion of Humors; and among the reſt three or four grains of Laudanum is the beſt. But take heed that you give it not to the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent being very weak, for it is to be feared that the native heat being very little, will be thereby quite exſtinguiſhed. One ounce of the Syrup of Poppies given in an aſtringent Julep at night will do the ſame.</p>
                     <p>At length you muſt come to proper Remedies which by an occult ſecret quality ſtop bleeding. The moſt uſual and beſt are theſe:</p>
                     <p>The Juyce of Nettles is extolled for ſtrengthening any blood, of what part ſoever, and therefore it is both given inwardly to four ounces once or twice, as alſo ſnuft into the Noſe, and applied to the Forehead and Temples made like a Cataplaſm with Bran, or the whol Nettle beaten. Some ſay that the Root held in the mouth will do the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Hogs Dung is one of the beſt Specifical Medicines, if it be applied hot to the Forehead and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, or ſmelt unto, or put dry into the Noſe, of which this is a form.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Hogs Dung dried three drams: the pouder of Roſes to take away the ſcent of it, half a dram. Mix them with juyce of Plantane, and dip a Tent therein to be thruſt into the Noſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Aſſes Dung uſed thus is alſo commended. And <hi>Rodericus a Caſtro lib. 1. de morbis mulierum, cap.</hi> 5. ſaith that a Phyſitian of ſeventy yeers old given to violent bleeding, carried alwaies Aſſes Dung not quite dry in a box about him, than which he confeſſed he never knew a better Medicine; eſpecially if when it was dry he mixed it with the Juyce of a Nettle, or if wet he put it alone into his Noſe.</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>The blood it ſelf which comes out of the Noſe, is not only vulgarly commended, but by the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſtop an Haemorrhagie by a ſpecifical quality; they fry it in a pan and give it the Patient to eat, he not knowing of it.</p>

                     <p>While you uſe the aforeſaid Remedies, you muſt think of the taking away of the Cauſe, which uſually is a thin watery Humor or Choller which abounds in the blood, and makes it move diſorderly, and provoketh Nature to throw it forth: whence it comes to paſs that when it is purged away and the blood clenſed that then Nature embraceth blood moſt familiarly as its chief Friend and the treaſure of Life, and wil not labor to caſt it forth.</p>

                     <p>And after every Evacuation, Aſtringent Juleps, or Opiates, that are above mentioned; you may make Juleps thus.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Roots of Snakeweed, and the greater Comfrey, of each one ounce: Plantane, Knotgraſs, Rupture-wort, &amp; Fumitory, of each one handful: of the four great Cold ſeeds, of each one dram: boyl them to a pint, and diſſolve in the ſtrained Liquor of white Sugar, three ounces: Make a Julep for three mornings draughts.</hi>

                     <p>Inſtead of Juleps or Opiats, or after they have been uſed a while, you may give a Syrup made of the Juyce of Nettles, and an equal proportion of Sugar, two ſpoonfuls at a time every mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                     <p>Nor is it ſufficient to take away the preſent Cauſe of the Hemorrhagy, namely, To Evacuate the Peccant Humor, but you muſt ſee that it return not again.</p>
                     <p>The Bowels are to be ſtrengthened, and their Diſtempers amended; eſpecially the Liver in which thoſe Humors uſe to breed.</p>
                     <p>And the Juleps formerly preſcribed wil do this, as alſo the Tincture of Roſes to Cool the Liver and ſtrengthen it, is very good.</p>
                     <p>Outwardly you may apply Epithems made thus,</p>

                     <p>Somtimes the Hot Diſtemper of the Spleen and Reins is the Cauſe of this Diſeaſe; and then you muſt apply Cooling Medicines to thoſe parts alſo.</p>
                     <p>To theſe muſt joyn a good order of Diet, which from the beginning of the Cure muſt be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently obſerved.</p>
                     <p>And therefore, firſt the Air where the Patient is, muſt be Cool: and if it be Summer time let it be altered, by ſprinkling the floor with Vinegar and Roſe-water, and ſtrowing of the Leavs of the Vine, Willow, or Water-Lillies, or the like.</p>

                     <p>Let the Patient abſtain, eſpecially in the beginning of the Diſeaſe while his ſtrength is good, from Wine, Fleſh, and Rear Eggs, which breed much and thin Blood: you muſt give him Moiſt Meats and Suppings in the time of his bleeding: As cooling Broths made of Barley, Oates, and Rice, with Water, for chewing doth provoke bleeding, if he be weak you may give him Fleſh-broth and Pana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, in which there is Starch diſſolved, which is made without Chalk or Gum Arabick.</p>

                     <p>Somtimes the Tongue grows very great, which cannot be accounted any kind of tumor; as <hi>Galen</hi> teacheth, <hi>lib. de diff. morb. cap.</hi> 9. that he ſaw a Tongue which grew exceeding great without, any

ſence of pain, neither would it pit or yield to the finger, but it was a bare increaſe of quantity in the Tongue, and the ſubſtance was no way hurt, which came by too much nouriſhment brought and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into the ſubſtance of it.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>Claudinus,</hi> Conſult. 9. gives an Example of this in a maid of twelve yeers old, whoſe Tongue grew to a great bigneſs, and the Tumor could neither be called an Oedema, nor a Schyrrus, becauſe it was without pain; neither would it yield to the hand preſſing of it, nor take an impreſſion or pit, nor was it without Natural ſence.</p>
                     <p>The Original of it was a forceable breach of the bridle of the Tongue, by the pain whereof blood was attracted to the part; which being ſent thither continually cauſed this largeneſs. But in this caſe <hi>Glaudinus</hi> obſerveth that it is bigger at night, and leſs in the morning, and alwaies livid, or blew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh: The reaſon whereof he ſaith is, becauſe in the Concoction and aſſimulation of the Blood, (which is flegmy otherwiſe, ſuch as is bred in children by reaſon of their moiſt Nature and intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance) many vapors are raiſed, eſpecially at night, when the heat is drawn in and contracted, by which the Tumor is enlarged: but in the day they are diſcuſſed by the motion and heat of the Tongue, by which means it becomes leſs.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon of the blewneſs is the Air, to which it alwaies is open; for by the coldneſs of the Air, the blood which cometh to the ſuperficies of the Tongue, before it comes to be like in the ſubſtance, doth encreaſe ſomwhat, and ſo turns livid. For <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith that blood waxeth black with cold, 3. <hi>de ſymp. cauſ. cap.</hi> 2. which yet is not ſo in other parts, becauſe there is no ſuperfluity ſent to them, but as much as is ſufficient for nouriſhment.</p>
                     <p>The knowledg of theſe Tumors is not difficult, becauſe the preternatural greatneſs of them is viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                     <p>But the differences of theſe Tumors are theſe: If there be an Inflamation, then there is pain heat, and redneſs alſo in the Tongue, wherewith alſo the face is ſomwhat infected: But if the Tumor come originally from flegm, the Tongue is white, and there is much ſpittle whoſe taſt is ſweet or without taſt. If there be only a bare encreaſe in the Tongue, there are no ſigns of other Tumors and Vitrous humors.</p>
                     <p>As to the Prognoſtick: Tumors in the Tongue for the moſt part do not endanger the life unleſs they grow ſo big that they cauſe ſuffocation, or come from a malignant melanchollick humor; from whence they may prove Cancers, which is known by their hardneſs, blewneſs, and pricking pain.</p>
                     <p>You muſt begin the Cure of the Inflamation of the Tongue with Revulſive and Repelling Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; and therefore firſt, after you have given a laxative Clyſter, open a Vein, and take away as much blood as the Patients ſtrength will permit.</p>
                     <p>Then apply Cupping-glaſſes with ſcarrification to the Shoulders.</p>
                     <p>After that uſe cooling and repelling Gargariſms, and among the reſt the Juyce of Lettice, is commended of <hi>Galen</hi> to waſh the Tongue with often, <hi>Meth. 14. Cap.</hi> 8.</p>
                     <p>Or you may make one more compounded of the Decoction of Plantane, Nightſhade, Peaſe husked, and Pomegranate peels, adding ſom Syrup of dried Roſes, or <hi>Diamoron,</hi> that is, Syrup of Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries.</p>
                     <p>After bleeding, appoint a Purge made of things to purge Choller and Flegm, becauſe flegm from the Head doth peculiarly concurr to the production of theſe Tumors.</p>
                     <p>After the flux is ſtopped, you muſt labor to derive the humor fixed to the part by Evacuations, Revulſions, and Repercuſſives; and to this end open the Vein under the Tongue, which if you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach by reaſon of the largeneſs of the Tongue, you muſt apply a Cupping-glaſs with Scarrifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under the Chin.</p>
                     <p>If it tend to ſuppuration, it muſt be furthered with a fig ſlit in the midſt, often applied, or with a Gargariſm of the Decoction of Barley, Mallows, Violets, Figs, Raiſons, Quince ſeeds, and Foenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greek ſeeds, with a little Syrup of Violets and Jujubes.</p>
                     <p>Suppuration being made, if the Impoſthume will not open of it ſelf, make inciſion: then clenſe it with the decoction of Barley, Agrimony, and Plantane, with Honey of Roſes.</p>
                     <p>But a ſoft and lax humor coming of flegm, is cured firſt by a Revulſion with Phlebotomy, if the Patient abound in Blood: then give him a ſtrong Purge, ſuch as <hi>Pilulae Cochiae minores,</hi> made of Aloes, Scammony, and Coloquintida, which were happily uſed by <hi>Galen</hi> to one of ſixty yeers, 14. <hi>Meth.</hi> above mentioned. But if he cannot ſwallow Pills, make him a Medicine of Senna, Agarick, Diaphoenicon, and the like.</p>
                     <p>After theſe Evacuations you muſt firſt apply cooling and repelling Medicines, as we ſhewed in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamation. And <hi>Galen</hi> in the place quoted, cured a Patient of ſixty yeers, only by waſhing with the Juyce of Lettice after Purging.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, You may with good ſucceſs waſh the mouth with Juyce of Lemmons, Pomegranates, Sorrel, and Plantane, becauſe they do not only repel with their coldneſs, but alſo with their ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:49088:76"/>
draw forth the moiſture that is faſtened in the Tongue.</p>
                     <p>Alſo the Tongue may be embrochated with Oxymel ſimple, unto which you may ad a little Gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Sal. gem. or Sal. armoniack.</p>
                     <p>You may alſo waſh the Mouth with the Decoction of Origan, and Pellitory, with Hydromel, or Honey and Water.</p>

                     <p>The ſame <hi>Zacutus,</hi> Obſ. 48. of the ſame Book, ſaies that he cured a child of ten yeers old, who had a Tongue ſwollen by a defluxion, ſo big that it could not be contained in his mouth (after Revultions by bleeding, Cupping-glaſſes with ſcarrification, and ſharp Clyſters) becauſe the Tumor was ſoft and looſ, only by profound ſcarrification of the Tongue, and after he commanded that it ſhould be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with ſalt Water, from whence there came ſuch abundance of humors that the child preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. Which Obſervation he took from <hi>Joachim Camerarius,</hi> who ſaith in his Book of Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that one who was almoſt ſuffocated with a ſwollen Tongue, cured himſelf by cutting it a croſs with a ſharp Pen-knife, after he had loſt much blood.</p>

                           </gap>rachos</hi> in Greek, in Latin <hi>Ranula;</hi> for ſince it differs from the reſt in Nature, and requires a different way of Cure, we thought it beſt to deſcribe it in its proper Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ranula</hi> is a Tumor under the Tongue in that part by which it is bound to the Ligament; and for the moſt part it is ſo large that it is above the lower Teeth; a cleft being in the middle dividing the right ſide of it from the left, it repreſenteth the hinder parts of a Frog, from whence it is called <hi>Ranula,</hi> a little Frog. Others ſay it is called ſo, becauſe they who have it, have an impediment in their Speech, and croak like Frogs, when they ſpeak. It is like the Tumor Oedima, or Meliceris, from which when it is opened, there comes as it were the white of an Egg, or matter like Honey. And becauſe the ſaid matter is contained in a bag, therefore it is accounted a Meliceris. In theſe bags ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is found a ſtone as many obſerve, which <hi>Schenkius</hi> alſo obſerveth, Obſ. 388. Lib. 10.</p>
                     <p>The knowledg of this Diſeaſe is not difficult, for when the Tongue is lifted up, there is ſeen a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain looſe and ſoft carnoſity, and on both ſides of the Ligament there is a certain round ſwelling like a Peaſe, Bean, or Che<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>This Diſeaſe is commonly without danger: But in Children ſomtimes it threatneth ſuffocation by Reaſon of the neerneſs of the Larynx to the rough Artery. In men if they have pain and a Feaver there is danger, for it may turn to Squinancy. Alſo that Ranula is dangerous which is black or dusky and hard, and inclining to the Nature of a Cancer, and this muſt not be touched.</p>
                     <p>For the Cure of this Diſeaſe, firſt you muſt take away the antecedent cauſe by blood-letting, and with purging agreeable to the age and nature of the Patient.</p>
                     <p>And if the Diſeaſe be old you muſt uſe Cauteries and ſweating Drinks.</p>
                     <p>Then you muſt endeavor to diſſolve the Tumor with Topicks, thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Pomegranate peels, dried Hyſop, and common Salt, of each two drams: Make a Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereof to hold under the Tongue, and uſe it often.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Foreſtus</hi> ſpeaks of a Girl of twelve yeers of age, that was cured in two daies ſpace with this only Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine; whoſe Author is <hi>Nicolaus Florentinus,</hi> who inſtead of common Salt, uſeth <hi>Sal. armoniack</hi> to men, becauſe it pierceth more, and diſſolveth better. And <hi>Foreſtus</hi> uſed the ſaid Pouder to a Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent made with common Salt: as alſo a Decoction made of equal parts of Gals, Allum, and Pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate flowers: And laſtly, he commanded the part to be rubbed with parched Salt, and <hi>Sal. gem.</hi> and the Patient was cured without manual Operation, which is ſeldom ſeen, becauſe thoſe Tumors are of the Nature of Impoſthumes, and are contained in a little bag, ſo that when the matter hath been diſcuſſed, they have been filled again.</p>
                     <p>If this Tumor cannot be cured with diſcuſſing Remedies, you muſt open it, which muſt be often done, for it will not often be diſcuſſed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="126" facs="tcp:49088:77"/>You muſt not make a ſmal Orifice when you open it, becauſe the matter contained in the Bagg, wil be again gathered and the bagg filled (unto which the part being looſe and ſoft, is very much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) but you muſt make a very long Inciſion through the height of the Tumor in both ſides that the whol matter may be diſcharged at once: then you muſt waſh the Ulcer, firſt with gentle things, as the Decoction of Mallows: and then with Clenſers, as white Wine and Honey of Roſes, or Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moron, and after with Oxymel till it be clean and free from the Bagg: And finally, to heal it up, waſh the mouth with red Wine in which Allum is diſſolved.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Foreſtus</hi> Cured the like in a Woman by an Inciſion made on both ſides, and after by waſhing with Wine and Water mixed with a little Salt.</p>
                     <p>If the Diſeaſe be old, and the Ulcer wil not be cured by the aforeſaid Remedy, let it be touched with Oyl of Sulphur twice every day, mixed with Roſe-water, one drop of Oyl to ſix of Water; for ſo the Diſtemper wil be corrected, and the part dryed, which muſt be often waſhed for confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with Red Wine with Allum diſſolved in it.</p>
                     <p>If after the uſe of theſe the Diſeaſe return, you muſt come to an actual Cautery, the manner whereof is taught by <hi>Paraeus, lib. 7. cap.</hi> 5.</p>

                        <hi>Chap. 3.</hi> Of the Taſte being Hurt.</head>
                     <p>THE Taſte as other Sences, and al actions of the Body, is hurt Three waies, by being Dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, Aboliſhed, Depraved; it is leſſened when it ſcarce perceiveth remiſs ſavors and ſtrong ſavors but a little: It is Aboliſhed when it no waies perceiveth thoſe ſavors whether they be great or little: It is Depraved when the object ſeems to be of another taſte.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes of Diminiſhing and Aboliſhing the taſte are the ſame, only they differ in degrees; for if they be light and weak, they Diminiſh; if great, they Aboliſh the taſte.</p>
                     <p>And theſe Cauſes are either a Defect of the Animal Spirit in the part, or a Diſtemper of the Third pair of Nerves which come to the Tongue; or the Tongue it ſelf is Preternaturally affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
                     <p>The Spirits fail, either by reaſon of their ſcarcity, as in dying men; or of the obſtruction of the Nerves of the Third Conjugation by which they are carried: or by reaſon of a Tumor bred in that part of the Head from whence thoſe Nerves do ariſe.</p>
                     <p>The Tongue is either covered with a moiſt ſlimy matter, or hath Tumors, Puſtuls, or Ulcers, and by theſe the proper action of taſte may be diminiſhed or aboliſhed.</p>
                     <p>The Taſte is Depraved when the Tongue is infected with an evil Humor, as in Feavers, when the Tongue is infected with Choller, al things taſted are thought better: otherwiſe if it be with ſalt flegm or melancholly al things appear to be ſalt or ſowr, for the outward objects being brought to the Tongue do move the vitious juyce of it, which at that time ſtriking upon the tongue moſt lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth its ſavor thereon, and ſo thoſe things which are taſted, ſeem to be of the ſame taſte.</p>
                     <p>It happeneth alſo ſomtimes that the Tongue perceiveth the ſavors of the juyces contained in its ſelf, although no external Object be applied, as <hi>Galen</hi> teacheth, 1. <hi>de ſympt. cauſ. cap.</hi> 4. And it is confirmed by daily Experience in men in Feavers, whoſe tongue is covered with Choller; which if it be very bitter, they find a continual bitterneſs on the Tongue though they take nothing into their mouths.</p>
                     <p>The Diverſity of the Cauſes aforeſaid is known by the variety of the taſts and diſpoſition of the Tongue; for a ſweet taſte and redneſs of the Tongue ſignifieth blood: bitterneſs and yellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Choller: whiteneſs with ſweetneſs Flegm: blackneſs and ſharpneſs Melancholly: a Nauſeous taſte ſheweth that evil Humors are contained in the ſtomach: Puſtuls, Tumors, and Ulcers are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to the Eies. And Laſtly, If the taſte be hurt, and there appear no change in the Tongue, you muſt ſuppoſe that the Cauſe lieth in the Brain or Nerves.</p>
                     <p>The Cure is various according to the diverſity of Cauſes; and therefore if the Diſeaſe lie in the Brain or Nerves, you muſt apply Remedies thereto, eſpecially ſuch as uſe to be preſcribed for the Cure of the Palzey: but when the taſte is depraved by ill Humors, commonly that Symptom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon other Diſeaſes, eſpecially upon Feavers, which being Cured the Symptoms alſo are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</p>
                     <p>If the Taſte be offended by Tumors, the Cure thereof depends upon the Cure of the Tumors above mentioned.</p>
                     <p>Finally, If it come from Puſtles or Ulcers of the Tongue, you muſt Cure them by blood letting and Purging of ſharp Humors; to which you may ad Cooling, Drying, and Binding Topicks in form of a Gargariſm: And if foul Ulcers be found, let them be clenſed with Honey of Roſes, with a little Oyl of Sulphur or Vitriol, in ſuch a quantity as may gently touch upon the Tongue.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="127" facs="tcp:49088:77"/>Or, if you wil Dry more violently, Let the part Affected be often touched with the aforeſaid Oyls, pure and not mixed; for ſo the Aphthe or Thruſh and al Ulcers of the Mouth and Tongue are quickly Cured.</p>

                     <p>But Organical, or Diſeaſes of the Inſtrument, are when the Tongue is enlarged, as we ſaid before concerning Tumors, which hinder the free motion of it: alſo when the figure or ſhape of it is defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as when the Tongue is naturally too ſhort, or by being partly cut off, or if it be tyed too ſtrait; as alſo when the ſeventh pair of Nerves which come from the Brain to the Muſcles which move the Tongue are ſtopped.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Common Diſeaſes are Solutions of Continuity or Wounds in the part.</p>
                     <p>Too much moiſture maketh Balbuties, a kind of Stammering, which keepeth men from prououn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the Letter R.</p>
                     <p>And this is either natural as in Children by reaſon of their much moiſture, who are Cured by age when the ſuperfluous moiſture is conſumed.</p>
                     <p>But in ſome there is a moiſt diſtemper al their Life, and they are alwaies ſtammerers; of which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſpeaketh <hi>Aph. 32. Sect.</hi> 6. thus, <hi>Stammerers are moſt ſubject to long Fluxes of the Belly. Galen</hi> in his Comments ſaith, <hi>That they who naturally ſtammer, have either a moiſt Brain, or Tongue, or both.</hi> From the moiſt Brain much moiſture may fal into the belly, whence the Flux is cauſed. And when the tongue is naturally too moiſt, it is probable alſo that the belly wil be looſe and weak through moiſtneſs: becauſe the Stomach and the Tongue have both the ſame Tunicle: Now the proper paſſion of a moiſt belly is a looſneſs.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Avicen</hi> ſeems to be againſt this Doctrine, ſaying, <hi>Fen. 1. lib. 3. tract. 4. cap.</hi> 18. That Stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merers are given much to Melancholly, and Melancholly cometh from a dry Brain: but this Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction is Reconciled, thus, <hi>Avicen</hi> meaneth by Stammerers, not ſuch as are properly ſo called and cannot pronounce R, but ſuch as Stutter, and repeat the ſame Syllable often before they ſpeak a word; and this cometh from a hot and dry Diſtemper of the Brain; in which the thoughts are ſo quick that they out-run the tongue, and haſten its motion, whence comes that diſturbance.</p>
                     <p>But the Stammering aforeſaid coming from the Birth, is incurable.</p>
                     <p>In ſome an accidentary Stammering cometh by a Catarrh; and great Defluxion of Rhewm upon the Jaws and Tongue, which is cured by Evacuation, Revulſion, and Derivation of the Humors; as alſo by Strengthening and Drying the Brain: but becauſe the Remedies are the ſame with thoſe for the Palzey of the Tongue of which we ſhal now ſpeak, they may be taken from thence.</p>
                     <p>Two pair of Nerves go to the Tongue: the Third pair to Exerciſe the act of Taſting and Sence: And the Seventh pair for Speech and diverſity of Motion; by the Obſtruction and Relaxation of the taſte, cometh the Palzey of the Tongue, which is a Privation or Diminiſhing of the motion of the Part; and this uſeth to follow an Apoplexey when the hinder part of the brain is too moiſt, and then other parts of the body, and for the moſt part half the body hath the Palzey; ſometimes it is only in the Tongue when the Nerves and moving Muſcles are too moiſt: alſo by cutting of thoſe Nerves there cometh a Palzey of which there is an example in <hi>Avicen, Fen. 6. lib. 3. tract. 1. cap.</hi> 12. in theſe words, <hi>A certain man was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cupped and Scarified, and the ſmal hair like Nerve, was cut with Scarification, which is in the ſubſtance of the Pannicle joyned with the Tongue; wherefore the Tongue was relaxed.</hi> We may ſuppoſe that theſe Cupping Glaſſes were applied to the Neck and hinder part of the head; for ſince the Nerves that move the Tongue, come from the beginning of the Spinal Marrow which is in the Neck: It is moſt certain that the Scarification was made ſo deep that ſome branch of them was divided.</p>
                     <p>But although the matter producing this Diſeaſe be Flegm, yet ſomtimes it is thicker and colder; ſomtimes thinner and hotter as the Humors which predominate in the Body; the knowledge where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is from<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>Avicen, Fen. 6. lib. 3. tract. 1. cap.</hi> 6. in theſe words, <hi>And ſomtimes the redneſs of the Tongue and hotneſs ſhew that the matter is blood; and ſomtimes much watery spittle ſheweth that
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:49088:78"/>
the matter is thin, and when there is little benefit by Reſolving Medicines, and much by binding and aſtringent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Diſeaſe, if it come from the Brain, and follow an Apoplexy, ſo that other parts alſo are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected is ſeldom cured, eſpecially if the Patient be in yeers; but if it be ſingle, and in the part only it is to be cured, and the eaſier if the Patient be yong.</p>

                        </gap>ey in the Tongue, is by taking away the antecedent Cauſe, that is the humor abounding in the Brain, and by diſcuſſing and diſſolving the conjunct cauſe, namely, the humor which is faſtened upon the Nerves that move the Tongue.</p>
                     <p>The antecedent cauſe will be taken away by the Medicines preſcribed in the Cure of the cold di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper of the Brain.</p>
                     <p>And firſt you muſt purge with Pills, or a Potion there mentioned. After if blood abound, and be either the Principal, or the aſſiſtant Cauſe of the Diſeaſe, take ſo much as age and ſtrength will permit, then adminiſter a Cephalick Apozeme, and if the Diſeaſe ſeem ſtubborn give a ſweating diet; all which are formerly preſcribed in the place mentioned.</p>
                     <p>After general Evacuations, come we to the Derivation of the matter, cauſing the Diſeaſe by Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and Veſicatories applied behind; as alſo by Cauteries. <hi>Avicen</hi> applied a Cupping-glaſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Chin, which is now alſo allowed.</p>
                     <p>Open the Vein under the Tongue, and it will profit, if before you have made general Evacuation to derive the Humor from the Muſcles of the Tongue.</p>
                     <p>For the diſcuſſing and drawing forth of this Humor, let the Gargariſm following be often uſed.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Flowerdeluce roots half an ounce: Origan, Sage, French Lavender, Roſemary, of each half a handful: Cubebs three drams: Liquoris one ounce: Boyl them in equal parts of white Wine and Water to a pint: Diſſolve in the ſtraining, Oxymel of Squils two ounces. Make a Gargariſm; to which if it work not ſtrong enough, you may ad two or three drams of the Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Pellitory of Spain, or of Muſtard ſeed. You may alſo ad Caſtorium if it offend not the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient with the ſcent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this end you may often rub the Tongue with Oxymel of Squils alone, or mixed with Muſtard Seed.</p>
                     <p>A bag of Sage is much commended for to rub the Tongue with often, to which you may ad Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard ſeed alſo.</p>
                     <p>Alſo theſe following Pills ought to be held often upon the Tongue.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Juyce of Bettony and Liquoris, of each one dram and an half: Caſtor and Aſſafa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tida, of each half a dram: Nutmeg and Spicknard, of each one ſcruple: Incorporate them with Honey, and make them into the form of Lupines.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here alſo Gargariſms, Maſticatories, and Errhines, which are preſcribed in the Cure of the cold di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper of the Brain may be uſed.</p>
                     <p>Alſo for the ſtrengthening of the Brain, and diſperſing the reliques of the humors therein contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, Fumigations, and Pouders for the Hair, with Caps mentioned in the ſame Chapter are here to be uſed.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, You muſt preſcribe the uſual Medicines againſt encreaſe of flegm, namely <hi>Syrupus Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtralis,</hi> or ordinary Pills, with a ſtrengthening Opiate, as is there declared.</p>

                        <hi>GAlen</hi> in his Fifth Book of the Compoſition of Medicines, <hi>cap. 8. &amp;</hi> 16. of the Uſe of Parts, <hi>cap.</hi> 2. ſaith, That the Teeth are not only ſenſible in reſpect of their Nerves at the Root, and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane which inwardly covers their Cavity, but alſo in their proper ſubſtance; and ſaith, That the Teeth and other parts of the Mouth do taſte, as alſo doth the tongue. And in his Book of Bones, <hi>cap.</hi> 5. he ſaith, Of Bones only the teeth are partakers of the tender Nerves of the Brain; and for that cauſe they alone do manifeſtly feel.</p>
                     <p>Therefore pain reacheth not only to the Nerves and inward Membrane, but alſo to the ſubſtance of the teeth.</p>
                     <p>The Tooth-Ach comes from a Flux of Humors, either Cold and Flegmy, or Hot and Watery, Salt and Sharp: hence comes the Diſtention or Convulſion of the parts: &amp; theſe Humors either flow
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:49088:79"/>
to the Membranes of the Jaws, and of the holes wherein the Teeth are, or to the Nerve which is inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the root of the Teeth, or to the ſubſtance of the Teeth. Although ſome think that the Teeth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not receive into their own ſubſtance afflux of humors and diſtention, becauſe they are moſt hard and thick; yet this is taught by <hi>Avicen, Fen. 1. Lib. 1. Doct. 1. Cap. 5.</hi> and <hi>Fen. 7. Lib. 4. Tract. 1. Cap. 4. And ſomtimes, ſaith he, there is matter which doth impoſthumate the Tooth it ſelf.</hi> Which Opinion he confirmeth and treateth of chiefly, <hi>Fen. 1. Lib. 3. Tract. 3. Cap. 1.</hi> in theſe words: <hi>It is not as ſome Phyſitians think, that the Brain it ſelf wil not impoſthumate, reaſoning thus; That which is ſoft, as the brain, and hard, as a bone, is not extended, and that will not impoſthumate which cannot be extended. But this is erronious, becauſe that which is ſoft, if it be viſcous or claminy, may be extended, and bones are impoſthumated, as Galen teacheth, &amp; we wil ſhew in our Chapter of the Teeth. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, we ſay that whatſoever is nouriſhed is extended and encreaſed with the nouriſhment, and it is likewiſe poſſible that it may be extended and augmented with its ſuperfluity, and that is an impoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hume.</hi> This <hi>Avicen</hi> teacheth from the Doctrine of <hi>Galen,</hi> who <hi>Lib. 5. de comp. med. ſec. loc. cap.</hi> 8. ſaith, <hi>Becauſe the Teeth cannot grow without nouriſhment, they are only obnoxious to theſe two Diſeaſes following, namely, of want, and ſuperfluity of nouriſhment: by want of nouriſhment they grow dryer and thinner, and by ſuperfluity of it, there will be an inflamation about the fleſhy parts.</hi> Thus <hi>Galen.</hi> But it is probable that pain is more uſual (if it be vehement) in thoſe parts which have moſt exquiſite ſence, namely, the Nerve and the Membrane in the hole of the Tooth next to the root, which doth not only ſuffer diſtention and vellication, but alſo ſomtimes inflamation of the humors flowing down; for it blood be mixed with other humors, then the pain hath two cauſes, namely, Diſtention, and Compreſſion, which comes from the hardneſs of the Tooth, which the Membrane being inflamed cannot endure: and this Inflamation of the Membrane is for the moſt part accompanied with the inflamation of the Gums; which alſo is reckoned by <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> and <hi>Avicen</hi> among the cauſes of the Tooth-ach.</p>
                     <p>Now the Humors commonly flow from the Head upon the Teeth and parts adjoyning, ſomtimes from the inferior parts; for when any bad humors, eſpecially watery, bred in any part, are aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the Veins, Nature deſiring to caſt off her burden, ſends them to the weakeſt parts And if the ſeeth by reaſon of the diſtemper, foulneſs, or eroſion are ſuch, the flux will chiefly come thither. <hi>Charls Piſo</hi> propounds an Experiment of this (who alſo thinks the Toothach con comes chiefly from a ſerous humor) <hi>lib. de morb. ab illuv. ſer. obſ. 7.</hi> where he reports that himſelf being troubled with the Tooth-ach for many daies, halr an hour after he had taken a purging Medicine, vomited up above a pint of cleer water with ſuch ſucceſs, that ten yeers after he was never troubled with it. By which Experience he alwaies preſcribed Medicines that purge water to them who were ſo troubled, and with good ſucceſs. Moreover, he ſtriveth to prove that it comes from this cauſe, by this ſign, Becauſe they who have the Tooth-ach, do continually ſpet.</p>
                     <p>Beſides the Cauſes mentioned, there are alſo Worms in rotten Teeth, and they breed of any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which is contained and putrified in the Cavities, whether it be excrementitious, or come of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifying meats, eſpecially fleſh and ſweet meats, which by reaſon of their clammineſs ſtick to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities of the Teeth.</p>
                     <p>Others think that the Tooth-ach comes ſometimes from wind contained between the Cavity and the Nerve, which doth violently ſtretch the inward Membrane, whence comes ſuch intollerable pain.</p>
                     <p>The principal external cauſes of Tooth-ach, are all thoſe things which cauſe defluxions; the chief are, Cold Air, South winds, ſtaying in the Sun, or night Air, Surfet, and all faults in Diet. Ad to theſe, things that debilitate the part, and make it more fit to receive a defluxion, as rotteneſs and hollowneſs in the Teeth, which ſometimes make violent pains.</p>
                     <p>The diverſity of Cauſes is k own by divers igns. For pain when it comes from hot humors is ſtronger, the conſtitution hotter, the age yonger, if Summer, there is heat ſenſibly in the part, and inflamation of the Gums often times; it is better for the uſe of cold, and worſe for hot things. But if it come from a cold humor, the ſigns contrary to theſe will appear.</p>
                     <p>If worms are the cauſe of pain, it will be intermitting, coming and going often, and ſomtimes the motion of the worm will be felt.</p>
                     <p>When it comes from Wind, it is known by the exceſs of pain, and ſenſible ſtretching, and it ends in ſhort time, and is eaſily cured with diſcuſſing Medicines.</p>
                     <p>The Prognoſtick is divers, according to the variety of the Cauſes; for that pain which comes from a hot, thin, watery, ſharp and ſalt humor, is more violent, but ſooner at an end, by reaſon of the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den change of the humor; but that which comes from a cold and flegmy humor, is leſs, and laſteth longer.</p>
                     <p>A Tumor riſing in the Gums or Jaws, takes away the pain of the Teeth, for the flux is carried to the external parts, ſo that it no longer lieth in the internal Cavity of the Tooth.</p>
                     <p>The Cure muſt be directed for the taking away the Cauſe, and mitigating the pain; for although
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:49088:79"/>
Anodines profit but little except the defluxion be ſtayed, yet ſomtimes we are conſtrained not only to uſe them, but alſo Narcoticks or Stupefactives before we take away the Cauſe; therefore the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor flowing to the Teeth is to be revelled, evacuated, and repelled, and that which is there, is to be derived and diſcuſſed.</p>
                     <p>Firſt therefore, if the pain comes of hot humors, open a vein in the Arm on the ſame ſide, by which the humor flowing will be revelled. But if it come of cold, bleeding is not ſo good; but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the defluxion it may be uſed, becauſe it is the chief reveller. But then you muſt take leſs blood, except there be a Plethory, in which regard although it be from fiegm, you may bleed freely according to <hi>Galen,</hi> who ſaid that a large evacuation of blood agreeable to the Plethory, is the beſt remedy for all pains, which we have found true by experience, not only in the paine of the teeth, but in other parts.</p>
                     <p>Let him purge the day following, with that which is proper for the humor; in the form of a Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if a hot, with Pills, if a cold humor be the cauſe of pain.</p>
                     <p>After this, if the pain continue, apply Cupping-glaſſes to the Shoulders with ſcarriſication, or one great one between the ſhoulders without ſcarriſication. A Veſicatory applied to the neck, or behind the Ears doth violently draw back the humors.</p>
                     <p>Alſo to hinder the defluxion, apply aſtringents to the Temples, as Emplaiſter of Gum Elemi, or Maſtich only, upon a piece of Silk, and heat with a braſs peſtle, the Shop Emplaiſter of Maſtich, or that againſt Ruptures called <hi>ad berniam.</hi> Or this following is good.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Frankinſence, Hypociſtis, Labdanum, of each one dram and an half: Pitch and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtich, of each one dram: Opium half a ſcruple: Oyl of Maſtich as much as is ſufficient: Make a Maſs of Emplaiſter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Root of Comfry freſh and bruiſed, applied to the Temples doth intercept the defluxion very well.</p>
                     <p>There is alſo a good Plaiſter made of pouder of Allum, and Galls mixed with Pitch.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Riverius</hi> the chief Phyſitian to <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, had this Plaiſter as a Secret:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Cyprus nuts, red Roſes, Muſtard ſeed torrefied or parched, Maſtich and Terra Sigillata, of each one dram and an half. Let them be ſteeped in Vinegar of Roſes twenty four hours; then dry them: Opium diſſolved in Aqua vitae three drams: Pitch and Colophonia, of each one dram: yellow Wax melted in the expreſſed Oyls, Henbane and white Poppy as much as is ſufficient: Make an Emplaiſter; apply it to the Arteries, and the part affected with pain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And becauſe the ſmal Veins by which nouriſhment is carried to the Teeth do run by the Ears, you put Medicines into them for the Cure of the Tooth-ach; as Oyl of bitter Almonds to the Ear on the ſame ſide, or the fume of Vinegar, in which Penyroyal and Origan have been boyled.</p>
                     <p>Others put Vinegar into the Ear, by which the defluxion is mightily ſtayed, eſpecially if the flux be hot.</p>
                     <p>But in a cold defluxion, the Juyce of Garlick mixt with Treacle and dropt warm into the Ear, doth wonderfully aſſwage the pain of the Teeth. A Clove alſo of Garlick peeld and put into the Ear, is good.</p>
                     <p>Alſo aſtringents in the beginning of the defluxion, may be applied to the part pained, cold, if the matter be hot, but if it be cold, you muſt put hot things with your repellers: But in every cauſe, if the pain be great, you muſt mix Anodines with Repellers. As,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Roots of Snakeweed, Five-leaved-graſs, and Tormentil, of each one ounce: the Leaves of Vervain, Plantane, and Maudlin, of each one bandful: Cypreſs Nuts, Galis, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn Cups, of each two drams: red Sanders, and Cryſtal, of each one dram and an half: red Roſes and Pomegranate Flowers, of each one pugil: boyl them in red Wine and Vinegar, and waſh the part grieved often therewith warm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This may be uſed in the beginning of a hot defluxion, but in a cold ad Cypreſs Roots, Box Bark, Ivy Leaves, and the like.</p>
                     <p>A plainer Medicine is made of Plantane and Roſe Water, with as much Vinegar like an Oxycrate.</p>
                     <p>Or boyl Galls in Vinegar, and waſh the Teeth therewith. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Roots of Cinkfoyl half an ounce: Willow Leaves half a handful: Galls two drams: boyl them in red Wine, and waſh the mouth. This ſtaies the defluxion, and takes away pain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then you muſt uſe theſe Remedies, which aſſwage pain, and take away the cauſe, of which there is in authors, and vulgarly a multitude: we will give you the beſt; of which you muſt make your choyce with this judgment, That thoſe which do not only diſſolve and diſcuſs, but alſo aſtringe and ſtop the flux, be uſed in the beginning and the encreaſe of the pain, but things that only diſcuſs in the ſtate and declination.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Juyce of Houſleek and Nightſhade of each two ounces: Cow or Sheeps milk eight ounces: Oyl of unripe Roſes one ounce and an half: Opium and Saffron of each three grains:
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:49088:80"/>

                     <p>Other Waters may be made to waſh the mouth: Thus.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the beſt white Wine four ounces: white Henbane Roots two drams: let them boyl to the Conſumption of the third part: ſtrain them, and ad one ounce of Vinegar: Varniſh one dram: let them boyl a heat, and let the Mouth be waſhed often therewith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The plain Decoction of Vervain is Commended of many for the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Alſo a Decoction of Guaiacum made with Wine, or Water, and a little ſalt. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Arſmart, and the barks of the Roots of Henbane, of each equal parts, boyl them in Roſe Vinegar, and waſh the mouth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And if the pain cometh from a Hot Cauſe, only boyl a Henbane Root in Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.</p>
                     <p>If the Arſmart be too ſharp, take a leſs quantity: Nay, you may leave it quite out in a Defluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on coming of a Hot Cauſe, and put Perſicaria Macutata inſtead of it, which is Aſtringent and Cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and his juyce may be given ſafely at the Mouth in al Defluxions that are ſharp and Chollerick: Alſo you may uſe the Leaves of Henbane inſtead of the Root.</p>
                     <p>Some uſe the Leaves of Henbane and Perſicaria Maculata as a ſecret Magnetick Charm, they boyl them in Vinegar, they burn the Leaves being boyled with a gentle fire, and waſh their Teeth with the Vinegar, and they ſay that as ſoon as the Leaves are burnt the pain wil be gone: But I rather think it is Cured by the Vinegar with which the Teeth are waſhed.</p>
                     <p>In the aforeſaid Decoctions if the Vinegar be ſo ſharp that the Patient can ſcarcely endure it, you may mix<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> half Wine; and in a Cold Cauſe make them of Wine only.</p>

                     <p>The Decoction of the Roots of the great Nettle, with a little Nutmeg and Saffron made in equal parts of Wine and Vinegar, and held warm in the Mouth, doth wonderfully draw the Humors forth.</p>
                     <p>But at the firſt, the pain wil ſeem to encreaſe; but afterward, it wil be mitigated, and ceaſe.</p>
                     <p>The Root of the ſharp Dock gathered in the Spring before it groweth forth and dried, applied to the Tooth pained, doth appeaſe the pain by a ſpecifical propriety: which is confirmed by the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Foreſtus,</hi> in <hi>Obſ. 6. lib.</hi> 4. where he ſaith, That he applied this Root green, and cut in ſmal pieces to the Tooth of a Maid with good ſucceſs; and that he Cured many other therewith after he had given them univerſal Medicines.</p>

                     <p>Commonly the Oyl of Cloves is uſed in a little lint to ſtop the Tooth if it be hollow, or otherwiſe, for ſo the humor adhering to the part is drawn forth and the part ſtrengthened.</p>
                     <p>Oyl of Camphire is very profitable for the ſame purpoſe.</p>

                     <p>It is to be obſerved, That the Teeth do ſeldom ake except they be hollow to the Nerve; therefore to take away the ſence of pain burn the Nerve with an actual Cautery, or with Aqua Fortis, or Oyl of Vitriol, which often done to a very hollow Tooth, it wil be broken in pieces, and ſo drawn forrh.</p>
                     <p>If the Pain ſtil continueth, and the Tooth be very hollow, you muſt draw it out, and then the pain wil preſently ceaſe and never return.</p>
                     <p>But you muſt take heed that you draw not the Tooth when the Defluxion falls violently, or when the Head aketh, or the Gums ſwel, or when there is great pain.</p>
                     <p>And the Chirurgion is to be Admoniſhed, That he pul it not out violently at one pul leſt the brain be too much ſhaken, and the Jaw bone broken; from whence comes a great Flux of blood, a Feaver, and ſomtimes death.</p>
                     <p>After it is Drawn, cloſe the part with your fingers, then let the mouth be waſhed with warm Oxycrate; and let him take heed of Cold Air, leſt a new Defluxion fal upon the other Teeth.</p>
                     <p>But if the blood flow ſo faſt that it wil ſcarce be ſtanched (which ſomtimes happeneth by the breach of the Vein and Artery, without the breach of the Jaw: And <hi>Varaiola</hi> reports of one that had his Tooth pulled out without iron or force but with the fingers, and yet bled a pint at one time, and as much the next day from the Artery under the Gum) This Flux of blood is ſtopt by laying a hard peice of lint like a ball, and holding it down for one hour or two with the fingers: If that wil not prevail, apply burnt Vitriol, and lay a Ragg upon it dipt in Vinegar, and compreſs it with your finger til you make an eſchar.

                     <p>MAny times the Teeth do contract a black, livid, or yellow color, from the evil Humors, clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving unto them, which by long continuance do alſo corrode them, and make them rotten: and theſe Diſeaſes come from filthy vapors that fly upwards, and are engendered of evil nouriſhment, or from the diſtemper of the ſtomach, which corrupteth good nouriſhment.</p>
                     <p>Quick-ſilver doth black the Teeth, whether it be uſed to the whol Body, as in the Pox, or only to the Face. Hence it is that women which uſe Mercury to make them fair, have black and ill color'd Teeth.</p>
                     <p>For the Cure you muſt firſt remove the antecedent Cauſe, and if it comes from evil humors in the ſtomach, they muſt be diſcharged, and the diſtemper of the parts which produce them muſt be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, and a good diet preſcribed, and thoſe things forbidden which do corrupt the teeth, eſpecially ſweet things.</p>
                     <p>Infinite Medicines are preſcribed by Authors for making teeth white, which may be experienced. We are contented with one, which preſently makes them white, clenſeth them, and keeps them from rotting, namely, the ſpirit of Sulphur, or Vitriol, in which you muſt dip a little ſtick, and rub the teeth with the end thereof, and then wipe them with a clout. In a great foulneſs you may uſe the Oyls by themſelves, otherwiſe you muſt mix them with Honey of Roſes, or fair Water, leſt by the often uſe of them the Gums ſhould be corroded. <hi>Montanus, conſil.</hi> 113. reports that he learned that at <hi>Rome,</hi> of a Woman called <hi>Greek Mary:</hi> to whom when he came when he was yong, and ſhe twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeers old, and after when ſhe was fifty, he found her almoſt in the ſame condition, and ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that her Beauty and ſtrength was preſerved by the Spirit of Vitriol, and that her Teeth which were very bad in her youth, were by that, made very fair and firm, and alſo her Gums; and alſo that ſhe perceived her ſelf by the uſe thereof to ſeem more youthful, and ſhe uſed every day one drop or two to rub gently her Teeth and Gums.</p>
                     <p>The Aſhes of Tobacco is very good alſo to clenſe and make white the Teeth.</p>
                     <p>For prevention, and to preſerve the Teeth, firſt clenſe them with a Tooth-picker made of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtich Wood, or the like; then waſh the mouth with Wine, and rub the Teeth with this Pouder:</p>

                     <p>THe Gums are eaten away and exulcerated by ſharp corroding humors which come unto them. The parts from whence they come are, the Brain, Stomach, Spleen, and others. Men that have Diſeaſes in the Spleen, are moſt ſubject to Ulcers in the Gums, as in the Scurvy; ſomtimes the eroſion of the Gums comes from worms, or the corrupt humors which cauſe worms, ſo that it is a plain ſign of worms when it continueth long. So ſaith <hi>Fabricius Hildanus, Obſ. 59. Centur.</hi> 1. the Son of a Citizen of <hi>Duſſeldorp</hi> was long troubled with eroſion of the Gums, and died, after the uſe of many internal Medicines and Topicks: when he was opened we found abundance of worms, which had ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten through his Guts, and many in his Stomach.</p>
                     <p>The Cure is firſt to be directed to the antecedent cauſe, and the vicious humors are to be evacuated by blood-letting and purging; the ſharp and hot humors are to be tempered with Apozemes, Juleps,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:49088:81"/>
and Phyſical Broths, and the like. The flux of the ſame is to be diverted by Cupping-glaſſes, and Cauteries fitly applied. And laſtly, the faults of the parts affected are to be corrected.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards you muſt uſe Topicks, which are to be altered according to the greatneſs of the diſeaſe, ſo that to a ſimple Eroſion, you muſt apply only thoſe which aſtringe and dry, as this Water fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>unripe Galls, Acorn Cups, and Flowers of Pomegranates, of each one ounce: red Roſes one pugil: Allum three drams: boyl them in two parts of Forge-water, and one part of old red Wine, and waſh the Gums often therewith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the Eroſion be not taken away with that, uſe this Opiate:</p>

Make them into Pouder, and mix them with Honey and a few drops of Spirit of Vitriol, or Sulphur. Make an Opiate, which muſt be ſpread upon linnen cloth and laid to the Gums at night.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Spirit of Vitriol and Sulphur, as they clenſe and whiten the Teeth, ſo they take away the rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs of the Gums, either alone, or mixed with Honey of Roſes, or Water, as in the former Chapter.</p>
                     <p>If the Ulcer be deep and foul, anoint with this:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>choyce Mirrh and Sugar-candy, of each equal parts: pouder them, and fill the white of an hard Egg cut in the midſt therewith; then tie it with a thrid, and hang it in a Wine-Celler with a glaſs under it, and there will come forth a Liquor or Balſom, with which anoint often.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if by the uſe of the aforeſaid, the diſeaſe be not cured, if the Tooth neer the Ulcer be rotten, you muſt pull it out, and then it will be preſently cured, otherwiſe never.</p>

                     <p>SOmtimes abundance of blood flows from the Gums, either Critically, or Symptomatically, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the former be very ſeldom, yet it is ſomtimes; ſo we may ſee by Experience, and by reading. So ſaith <hi>Dodonaeus, Obſ.</hi> 14. A certain Quarrier having the ſmal Pox, had a flux of blood from his Gums, and being ſtopt, it made the Urine bloody, which being ſtopt it returned again to the Gums, and there continued till he recovered of the ſmal Pox. <hi>Amatus Lucitanus, Curat. 5. Centur.</hi> 5. ſaies that ſome have had benefit by bleeding at the Gums, and have been worſe when it was ſtopped. Alſo <hi>Zacutus Lucitanus, obſ. 86. lib. 1. Praxis admir.</hi> ſpeaks of a Goldſmith who when he fell into a Feaver by laboring at the Furnace, being of a ſtrong conſtitution, loſt much blood by opening a Vein and amended, ſo that the ſeventh day (having had an itching of his Gums, and a pain in the lower Lip) the blood guſhed from the Veins of his lower Gums for three daies in ſuch a quantity that he loſt above five pints more, and the more he bled, the more his Feaver abated, and when it was gone the blood ſtopped.</p>
                     <p>The Gums bleed Symptomatically when the blood is ſharp, and the Liver or Spleen diſtempered: So that in the Scurvy this flux is ordinary.</p>
                     <p>Somtimes after a Tooth is drawn, there is ſo great a flux of blood by reaſon the Artery is torn, which is the root of the Tooth, that ſomtimes men have died thereof.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of a Symptomatical flux, is by bleeding and purging, and other Remedies for the bowels. As alſo by Topicks aſtringing, made into Gargariſms, Pouders, Liniments, or Opiates.</p>
                     <p>If it come from a Tooth drawn, you muſt firſt let blood and Cup to make revulſion, and apply a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringents to the part, as a Cataplaſm, of Bole-Armenick, Terra Sigillata, Sanguis Draconis, and the like aſtringents made up with the white of an Egg. Alſo Time alone with the white of an Egg is good. But if they do not ſuffice, you muſt lay the Patients finger upon the part, and let him hold it there till the blood congeal above the orifice of the Artery. If it cannot be ſtopt with ſleight things uſe ſtronger. <hi>Valeriola, obſ. 3. lib.</hi> 5. reports that an old woman who had a Tooth taken forth with the ſingers only, had a violent bleeding upon it, from the Artery under the Gum; which he ſtopt with burnt Vitriol when other things failed; which is excellent both for aſtringency and burning. <hi>Zacutus Lucitanus, obſ. 84. lib. 1.

                        <hi>Chap. 5.</hi> Of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>cers of the Mouth, and Jaws.</head>
                     <p>THe ſmal and ſuperficial Ulcers of the Mouth are uſually Aphthae or Truſh, although in <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> it is ſomtimes uſed for Ulcers in other parts; but they which are deeper are abſolutely called the Ulcers of the Mouth and Jaws: Such as are in the French Pox.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Ulcers breed of ſharp Humors or Vapors coming from divers parts into the Jaws; ſo in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Feavers they often happen, or to thoſe that have hot Livers, or foul Bodies: So the Children have the Truſh, as <hi>Hipp. aph. 24. ſect.</hi> 3. either from the ſharpneſs of the Milk which Ulcerates thoſe tender parts in its paſſage, as <hi>Galen</hi> teacheth in his Comment upon the ſame Aphoriſm, or from the corruption of the milk in the Stomach by which ſharp vapors are ſent to the mouth, as <hi>Galen</hi> affirms, 9. <hi>de compoſ. med. ſec. loc. cap. ultimo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now theſe Ulcers are divers, as ſome are ſlighter, ſome more dangerous; ſome are in Children, ſome in Men; ſome are joyned with Inflamation, ſome are without; theſe divers degrees are accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the variety of the Humors of which they come: For they proceed either of Blood, Choller, Flegm, or Melancholly, or Choller Aduſt, which hath not only a burning, but often a malignant quality, and begets evil conditioned Ulcers.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Differences are known by their proper ſigns, for if the Ulcers be Rediſh they come of Blood: if Yellow, of Choller: if White, of Flegm: if Livid or Blew, from Melancholly, if they ſtink they are foul.</p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſtick.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aphthae,</hi> or Truth is eaſily Cured, but deep Ulcers and putrid, called in Greek <hi>Nomai,</hi> are hardly Cured: And in Children they are more dangerous by reaſon of their tender fleſh which they ſooner devour: As alſo becauſe ſtrong Medicines cannot be applied unto them; hence ſomtimes Children die of them, when they are Malignant and putrid.</p>
                     <p>Alſo in reſpect or the Cauſe, thoſe Ulcers which come of Flegm, are leaſt dangerous: thoſe that come of Blood or Choller, more: and thoſe that come of Melancholly, moſt of al.</p>
                     <p>Black and Cruſty Ulcers are deadly, eſpecially in Children.</p>
                     <p>The Jaws Ulcerated in a Feaver are hard to be Cured, as <hi>Hipp.</hi> teacheth, 3. <hi>Prog.</hi> Becauſe as <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> explaineth they ſhew the malignity of the matter.</p>
                     <p>The Cure is firſt by good Diet, which Cooleth and Dryeth, and hindereth the Generation of the antecedent Cauſe: Therefore when Children have it from their Suck, let the Nurſe be changed, or eate good Diet, as alſo let her blend and be purged, if need be: eſpecially let her eate Cool Aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent things, as Quinces, Pears, Medlers, Services, Lettice, and Purſlain, preſcribe the ſame to men, and let them avoid ſharp things, ſalt, and pepper.</p>
                     <p>Then you muſt look to the antecedent Cauſe, with Univerſal Evacuations according to the age; And firſt Phlebotomy doth powerfully revel the Humors, and tempereth their ſharpneſs, by Cooling the whol body.</p>
                     <p>After this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>up and Scarrifie, put Horſleeches behind the Ears and under the Chin, and apply a Veſicatory to the Neck behind.</p>
                     <p>The next day after you have let blood, you muſt preſcribe a Purge, agreeable to the Humor of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending, and the age of the Patient.</p>
                     <p>From the beginning of the Cure uſe Topicks, called by <hi>Galen</hi> Stomatica, or Medicines for the Mouth: and at firſt they muſt be mild, as Gargariſms, Mouth-waters made of Plantane, Honey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuckle, and Roſes; Water with Syrup of dried Roſes and of Mulberies: or Decoctions of Plantane, Bramble Leaves, Knot-graſs, Pomegranat Flowers, Red Saunders, and the like; with Syrup afore mentioned.</p>
                     <p>And if there be Inflamation, you may do wel if you ad the Juyce of Nightſhade, Houſleek, and Purſlain, with as much Sal Pruneilae as wil not make it too ſharp: Or a little crude Allum.</p>
                     <p>If there be no Inflamation, the Chief &amp; only Remedy is Spirit of Vitriol, or Sulphur, which may be uſed alone to Men, upon a little lint at the end of a ſtick, gently touching the part, by which it wil be preſently Cured if it be a ſimple Aphtha: But to Children you muſt mix the Spirit aforeſaid with
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:49088:82"/>
Honey of Roſes, ſo that it may be but a little ſharp, and with a little Lint at the end of a Probe often apply it, and they wil be quickly Cured.</p>
                     <p>If the Ulcers are very painful and inflamed, they muſt Gargle with Milk often, or with an Emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Cold Seeds, or the Mucilage of Fleabane-ſeeds and Quince-ſeeds extracted with the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Roſes, Plantane, and Nightſhade.</p>
                     <p>If the pain wil not be removed with theſe Revulſions and Topicks, but the Humors are ſtil drawn thither by it, which cauſeth want of ſleep, and Conſumption of the body, which endanger the life; the laſt Remedy is Narcotick, which wil aſſwage the pain and ſtop the Flux, you muſt give it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſtrength and age of the Patient.</p>
                     <p>I once ſaved a Childs life (by Gods aſſiſtance) of Four Yeers old with one grain of Laudanum, when his Jaws and Tongue were deeply Ulcerated with ſuch an Inflamation, that he could neither take Broth, nor Topicks, the Humors flowing ſo faſt from his mouth, that he lay night and day com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining without any reſt.</p>
                     <p>If the Ulcer be ſordid, Firſt waſh it with the Decoction of Barley, and Honey of Roſes; and in Children, with Milk chaly beated, or in which Steel hath been often quenched, mixed with Conſerve of Roſes; then uſe ſtronger Medicines, and principally Honey of Roſes above mentioned made a little ſharp with ſome drops of Spirit of Vitriol:</p>
                     <p>If theſe wil not do, you may ad to the Waters and Decoction above mentioned burnt Allum, the Collyrium of <hi>Lanfrank</hi> and Aegyptiacum, in a quantity agreeable to the Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, If it come from the French Pox, it wil not be Cured til the Pox be Cured.</p>

                        <hi>Chap. 6.</hi> Of the Relaxation of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vula, or Falling Down of the Pallate.</head>
                     <p>THe Relaxation of the Uvula comes from a Rhewm falling from the Brain upon it, with which there is ſomtimes bloud mixed, and then there is an Inflamation alſo, and this often fals upon the Tonſils or Spongious Kernels; the Inflamation whereof ſhal not here be treated of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is Cured by the ſame means, with the Inflamation of the Tongue, and of the Ulcers of the Mouth.</p>
                     <p>A Wateriſh Humor falling upon the Uvula or Collumella, doth ſo moiſten, ſoften, and relax it, that it wil be extended to the upper part of the oeſophagus or Wezand, and cauſe a Nauſeouſneſs, and the Patient wil ſeem to have ſomthing in his Throat which he cannot ſwallow down, by which you may know it without looking into the mouth.</p>
                     <p>The Cure is firſt by the Antecedent Cauſe, that is, by Evacuating the Humors flowing from the Head, by Revelling and Deriving them with ſuch Medicines as were preſcribed in the Cure of a Catarrh.</p>
                     <p>The Chief Topicks are Aſtringents and Repellers, ſuch as were preſcribed in the Cure of the Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Gums and Jaws, and ſhal be preſcribed in the Chapter following of the Cure of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gina, to which afterwards you muſt ad ſome Reſolvers and Dryers: And though the Gargariſms in thoſe Chapters mentioned, are here good, yet when there is no Inflamation the uſe of Pouders is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for with them the Vvula relaxed is more powerfully dried and Aſtringed.</p>
                     <p>And therefore, Firſt apply Pomegranat peels poudered, and after mix it with a little Pepper: Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Red Roſes and Pomegranat flowers and Peels of each half a dram: the Roots of Snak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weed and Tormentil, Galls and Flower-de-luce-Roots, of each one dram: burnt Allum, two ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: make a Pouder. Ordinary Chirurgeons apply the Pouder of Long Pepper, but it is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, for it is to be feared, leſt the Humors ſhould be drawn violently from the Brain, to the part.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Manner of applying this Pouder is to depreſs the Tongue with a Speculum Oris, and then blow up ſome pouder in your Uvula ſpoon: do this often til the Humor be ſpent: The inſtrument invented by <hi>Fabricius Hildanus, Obſ. 21. Cent.</hi> 2. is the beſt for this.</p>
                     <p>And if the Uvula relaxed cannot be brought to its former condition by theſe means, but continueth extended and painful; your laſt Remedy is to cut off a piece thereof: in which Operation you muſt take ſome Cautions. The firſt is from <hi>Hippocrates, 3. Progn. Text.</hi> 21. where he ſaith, <hi>That <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vula's are Cut and Scarrified, and burnt when they are red and ſwoln, but not without danger; for an Inflamation followeth, and a Flux of Blood; but you muſt endeavor to extenuate theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents by other means at that time: But when the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vula hangs down, and the lower part of it is greater than the higher, and round, then it is ſafe to operate: but it is better firſt to adminiſter a Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:49088:83"/>
if time will permit. Galen</hi> in his Commentary upon theſe words of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> ſaith that an Uvula inflamed, is not to be cut off, or ſcarrified; but after the inflamation is gone, ſo that the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior part is leſſened. Another Caution is taken out of <hi>Paulus Aegineta, lib. 6. cap.</hi> 31. you muſt not touch the Uvula with an iron to cut it when it is livid or blackiſh, that is, when it hath malignity in it, and inclineth to be a Cancer. But out of the ſame Author we have a lawfulneſs of the operation, when they are long and white, or as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith, ſmal at the top. We have an Example of the good ſucceſs of this operation in <hi>Amatus Lucitanus,</hi> Obſ. 65. Cent. 3. upon a Student who had his Uvula hung down like a thong, long, and without blood in it; which when Medicines could not cure, he cut off, and after touching the part with a little Spirit of Vitriol, he cured the Patient.</p>
                     <p>The third Caution is, That you cut not off too much; for then the Voyce and Breathing will be hurt according to <hi>Galen, 11. de uſu part. cap.</hi> 11. and conſumption and death it ſelf will enſue as often is ſeen in the French Pox.</p>

                        <hi>Chap. 7.</hi> Of <hi>Angina,</hi> or Quinzie, or Squinzie.</head>
                     <p>THe word <hi>Angina</hi> taken generally ſignifies every Diſeaſe of the Jaws and Throat, by which breathing and ſwallowing are hindered, when there is no defect in the Lungs and Breaſt.</p>
                     <p>And this is two-fold, a Legitimate and proper Squinzy; and a Baſtard, or or improper.</p>
                     <p>A Legitimate Squinzy comes from an Inflamation by which the Muſcles of the Jaws and Throat being ſwelled, do ſtop and contract the waies of breathing and ſwallowing. This Inflamation doth either poſſeſs the Throat or the Jaws, called <hi>Pharynx.</hi> Both theſe parts have both internal and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Muſcles. And though for the moſt part the <hi>Pharynx</hi> and <hi>Larynx,</hi> Jaws and Throat, do ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in an <hi>Angina</hi> by reaſon of their neerneſs, yet one is more affected than the other: Hence many differences of Symptomes do ariſe, in reſpect whereof <hi>Galen</hi> in 4. <hi>de loc. aff. cap.</hi> 5. makes four ſorts of <hi>Angina's,</hi> which the Grecians before his time named too curiouſly. One is called <hi>Sunag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chen;</hi> another <hi>Cunagchen;</hi> the third <hi>Paraſunagchen;</hi> and the fourth <hi>Paracunagchen.</hi> If the Inflamation be in the inward and proper Muſcles of the Larynx, it is called <hi>Cunagche;</hi> if it be in the inward Muſcles of the Pharynx, <hi>Sunagche;</hi> if in the outward Muſcles of the Larynx, <hi>Paracunag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che;</hi> and if in the outward Muſcles of the Jaws or Pharynx, it is called <hi>Paraſunagche.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Not only the Muſcles of the Jaws and Throat are for the moſt part inflamed, as aforeſaid, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the parts adjacent, and the outward part of the Neck, as ſhall be ſaid in the Diagnoſtick and Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtick of this Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>In all theſe kinds of <hi>Angina's,</hi> when there is great danger by the difficulty of ſwallowing, then thoſe things which are given uſe to fly out at the Noſe, eſpecially if they be liquid things, which are more hard to be ſwallowed at that time; becauſe they ſpread themſelves abroad, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo eaſily be comprehended of the Muſcles to be ſent into the <hi>Oeſophagus,</hi> which Muſcles cannot ſufficiently contract themſelves by reaſon of the inflamation; but ſolid nouriſhment being more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulent, need only the ſuperficial action of the Muſcles, and are ſwallowed down by a ſmal contraction of them. But it ſomtimes falls out that ſolid things are harder, and liquid things eaſier to be ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which dependeth upon the diverſity of the parts affected: For the Muſcles of the Larynx are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for to ſwallow meat, as well as for the voyce; and when the meat is thrown into the <hi>Oeſopha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> the Larynx is lifted up with the Tongue: But for to ſwallow drink we uſe the Tongue moſt, which while it is drawn inwards it brings the drink from the Lips to the Jaws. If therefore the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that move the Tongue are more affected, it is harder to ſwallow drink. But if the Muſcles of the Larynx are more hurt, it is harder to ſwallow meat.</p>
                     <p>Here by the way we muſt mark, that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſomtimes by the word <hi>Angina,</hi> doth underſtand only the inflamation of the Larynx, and ſo it is taken more ſtrictly; of which there is an Example 6. Epid. Sect. 8. Text. 1. where he ſaith thus: Some had inflamations of their Jaws, ſome had <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gina's;</hi> where by the name <hi>Angina</hi> he underſtands the inflamation of the Muſcles of the Larynx, and diſtinguiſheth it from the inflamation of the Jaws.</p>
                     <p>A Baſtard <hi>Angina</hi> is without a Feaver, and is two-fold.</p>
                     <p>The firſt and moſt ordinary comes of Rhewin falling upon the Jaws and parts neer unto the Larynx.</p>
                     <p>The other comes from the Luxation of the <hi>Vertebra's</hi> of the Neck, by which the paſſage of the Gullet and Throat, is preſſed and made narrow.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſe of a true <hi>Angina,</hi> as of other inflamations, is either pure blood, or mixed with Chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, Flegm, or Melancholly, which falls upon the parts aforeſaid out of the Branches of the Jugular Veins, and this is either attracted by the heat or pain of thoſe parts, or ſent from other parts, becauſe theſe parts are weak, looſe, and fit to receivea defluxion, eſpecially if the whol Body abound with
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:49088:83"/>
humors, or the Head, or the parts neer the Jaws. For when evil blood aboundeth in the whol Body, and is carried unto the Head, if the Brain be ſtrong it will not receive it, but ſends it down by the ſame Veins into the lower parts; hence come divers inflamations as Parotides, or tumors under the Ears, Ophthalmies, Angina's, and the like.</p>
                     <p>Yong men are more ſubject to the Angina, than old, becauſe they have much Chollerick blood, and becauſe they are full bodied, and have much blood, eſpecially in the Head.</p>
                     <p>Some Authors ſay that men are more ſubject to Angina's than women; which it ſeems <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> obſerved, 6. Epid. Sect. 7. where deſcribing an Epidemical Conſtitution, in which Angina's, Coughs, and Peripneumonia's, or Inflamations of the Lungs, were frequent, he affirmeth that few wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were ſick, and he gives no other reaſon, but becauſe they went leſs abroad than men, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were not ſo ſubject to injuries from the Air. Which Reaſon doth not agree with the univerſal Propoſition, That women are leſs ſubject to Angina's than men; but this may be a true Reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe women have colder Blood, a leſs Larynx or Wind-pipe, and narrower Veins of the Throat. For which Reaſon thoſe parts do not ſo eaſily receive defluxions.</p>
                     <p>The precedent Diſeaſes may be reduced to their internal Cauſes, as continual, putrid, burning, and eſpecially Epidemical Feavers, ſuch as were mentioned by <hi>Foreſtus,</hi> Obſ. 2. Lib. 6. which happened in the yeer 1517. at which time all that were infected had an inflamation of the Jaws, and died within ſixteen or twenty hours, except they were let blood within ſix hours. But in this <hi>Angina</hi> the Feaver is not Symptomatical, but Eſſential, and the <hi>Angina</hi> is ſymptome to it, becauſe part of the matter cauſing the Diſeaſe is ſent to this place; for in Epidemical Feavers, <hi>Angina's,</hi> Pleureſies, Inflamation of the Lungs, Diſenteries, and the like do happen, from ſome ſecret force and influence of the Stars, by which ſomtimes one part of the Body, and ſomtimes another is more affected.</p>
                     <p>Whatſoever can cauſe a flux of humors to theſe parts may be reckoned among the external Cauſes of this Diſeaſe: As Southernly winds, according to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> Aph. 16. Sect. 3. in time of much rain, many diſeaſes happen, as long Feavers, Fluxes of the Belly, Putrifactions, Falling-ſickneſſes, Apoplexies, and Angina's. Alſo for the producing of this laſt, the inequality of weather doth much, when the parts are made looſe by heat; and by cold ſuddenly coming thereupon, the humors are ſent thither. A ſudden cooling after heat, and drinking of cold water doth the ſame, or if the Head be kept too hot or too cold.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Cauſe of a Baſtard Angina, is propounded by <hi>Hippocrates, 4. de vict. rat. in morb. acut. text.</hi> 39. where he ſaith, an Angina comes when in Winter and Spring time much ſlimy flegm falls from the Head to the Jugular Veins, which obſtructeth the paſſages of the Spirits with its cold glewineſs.</p>
                     <p>There is another Cauſe of a Baſtard Angina given by <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> 2. Epidem. Sect. 2. namely, a Tumor riſing in the Vertebra's of the Neck, and eſpecially in that which is called <hi>Dens,</hi> or the ſhape of a Tooth by <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> by which the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> are drawn inward, and therefore a Cavity ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the external part. Now this Tumor either comes from flegm, removing by its encreaſe the <hi>Vertebra</hi> from its ſeat, or from blood falling upon the Muſcles, from whence comes an inflamation by which the Muſcles being contracted draw the <hi>Vertebra's</hi> inward, and then it is a true Angina coming from the inflamation of the ſaid Muſcles. There may alſo be a Luxation of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> by a fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick humor looſing their Nerves, and making them ſlippery between the Joynts. And laſtly, it may come from an external Cauſe, as a fall, or ſtroak, as in other parts.</p>
                     <p>An Angina is generally known, firſt by its proper ſigns, namely, difficulty of breathing and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, when there is no fault in the Breaſt and Lungs, and when pain is felt about the Jaws and Throat: and in a true Angina, redneſs, heat, and a feaver are ſigns.</p>
                     <p>The Differences may be diſtinguiſhed by their proper ſigns. In <hi>Synanche</hi> there is leſs difficulty of breathing, but great difficulty in ſwallowing, ſo that moiſt things can ſcarce be ſwallowed, but come out at the Noſtrils.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Paraſynanche</hi> there is leſs difficulty of breathing, nay, very little, becauſe the inflamation of the external Muſcles of the Jaws doth little hinder reſpiration, there is pain and redneſs outwardly in the Neck, when the outward parts are inflamed.</p>
                     <p>In Cynanche there is great hinderance of Reſpiration, ſo as the Patient ſeems to be ſtrangled, and ſomtimes is ſtrangled for a ſhort time, and cannot breath but with the Neck upright, and the Mouth open.</p>
                     <p>The Jaws are much pained, yet there is no redneſs or Tumor inwardly in the Jaws, nor outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Neck; the Tongue is livid, black, and retorted, or bent by reaſon of the great fulneſs of the Veins about it. There uſeth alſo to be an acute Feaver, you may find an acute deſcription of this kind of Angina in <hi>Hipp. 3. de Morbis.</hi> And this is remarkable, which is obſerved of few, the inward Muſcles of the Larynx are not here only affected but the Lungs themſelves, from whence is difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of breathing and Suffocation, which <hi>Dodonaeus</hi> obſerveth very wel, Obſ. Med. Cap. 18. where he relates a hiſtory of a Butcher who at noon felt a pain about his Jaws and Throat, and ſome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:49088:84"/>
in ſwallowing, and died ſtrangled the ſame night; his body being opened the ſubſtance of his Lungs were found turned into matter.</p>
                     <p>He gave other Examples, <hi>Anno</hi> 1565. in which yeer many had the Angina, with pain about the Larynx, which ceaſing, they fel into Peripneumonia, and they being opened after death, had either their Lungs ful of Water or impoſthumated; but nothing was perceived about the Larynx or its Muſcles, which might ſhew an inflamation: And in theſe Cauſes he ſuppoſeth that the Larynx did not ſuffer principally, but by conſent; and it is probable that the Aſpera Artery, or rough Artery and its branches may be filled and extended with the Humor flowing from the head, and then if the Humor be ſent to other veſſels, the Aſpera Artery and Larynx are freed from pain, and the Lungs are infected, and ſo an Angina may turn into a Peripneumonia: We may gather that the Lungs may be affected in an Angina from <hi>Hippocrates, 4. acut. text. 30. &amp;</hi> 31. where he laies down Two kinds of Angina's from the diverſity of the Humors; one, in which a Flux of Rhewm in Winter and Spring is carried to the Jugular veins; another, in which Choller abounds, which is in Summer and Autumne: of the laſt he ſpeaks thus, When a hot and ſalt Defluxion comes from the head, being ſharp it gnaws and ulcerates, fils with Spirits, brings an Orthopnaea or difficulty of breathing with the Neck ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth, and much drouth. Beſides, there is no Tumor; the Tendons of the Neck behind are ſtretched like a Cramp, the voice is hindered, the breath is little, and often ſtopped, ſuch have the Artery ulcerated, and the Lungs inflamed, ſo that they cannot breath: Thus <hi>Hippocrates</hi> he ſaith alſo that a hot and ſharp Defluxion wil bring an Orthopnaea, becauſe it biteth, ulcerateth, and filleth with Spirits, which are carried to the place hurt; hence comes the filling of the Lungs from whence Orthopnaea comes: When there is no room for receiving of the external Air, how much ſo ever the Lungs be enlarged. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> affirms this, 3. <hi>de morbis,</hi> where in the Cure of a Squincy he ſaith, the vein under the Breaſt or Papp is to be opened, for in this part there is a hot Spirit from the Lungs, and a little after he ſaith, You muſt make haſt to cauſe Spetting, and that the Lungs may grow leſs, as if the Lungs were ſwoln by the hot Spirit contained therein. But it is moſt remarkable that when the Spirits are carried in great plenty to any part, there is alſo blood carried therewith, which if it flow in ſuch a quantity that it cannot be wel governed by nature, it uſeth to make inflamations and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthumes; from whence it is no wonder if in ſuch an Angina the lungs become purulent or full of water.</p>
                     <p>In a Paracynanche the breath is leſs difficult than in a Cynanche; but more difficult than in Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanche, there is ſome redneſs and tumor about the Jaws.</p>
                     <p>A Baſtard Angina is known by the Flegm, by want of Feaver, by the plenty of humors flowing to the mouth.</p>
                     <p>But a baſtard Angina coming of a Luxation is known by the hurt motion of the Head and Neck, and by the Preternatural Cavity which appears in the Neck by reaſon of the Vertebra inwardly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</p>
                     <p>The knowledg of the Cauſes is taken from the univerſal and particular ſigns of the humors predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating in the whol Body.</p>
                     <p>When an Angina comes of blood, there is heat and redneſs in the Face, and a great diſtention in the part affected. When it comes of Choller, the pain and heat is greater, with thirſt, bitterneſs in the mouth, and ſharpneſs. And if it comes from flegmatick blood, the pain and redneſs is leſs, and the Feaver little.</p>
                     <p>From the part affected ſome knowledg of the humor offending may be had. For Chollerick blood for the moſt part maketh an inflamation in the Muſcles of the Larynx; but flegmy blood goes rather to the Jaws; for when the Veins of the Larynx are ſmal, only thin blood goes thither; but the Jaws being looſe and ſpungy, do more eaſily receive the flegmatick humors.</p>
                     <p>Finally, From the time of the yeer you may know the peccant humor: For Chollerick Angina's do come chiefly in the Summer and Autumn, becauſe in the Summer Choller breedeth, and in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eteined. But flegm breeds in Winter and the Spring, becauſe the humors gathered in Winter are then melted and ſent from the Head into the infe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ior parts.</p>
                     <p>As to the Prognoſtick. A true Angina is a moſt acute Diſeaſe, and very dangerous by reaſon of the hinderance of reſpiration, and for ſtrangulation, which ſomtimes happens by the ſtoppage of the paſſages, by which reſpiration is made. Therefore by how much the greater the Conſtriction, ſo much the more danger, and ſo the firſt kind of Angina is moſt dangerous, becauſe the inflamation of the internal Muſcles of the Larynx doth more ſtop the paſſage. Whence <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> Aph. 34. Sect. 4. ſaith thus: <hi>If a Suffocation comes preſently upon a Feaver, and no Tumor in the Jaws, it is mortal.</hi> Which Opinion he confirmeth in <hi>coac. &amp; progn.</hi> ſaying that theſe kinds of Angina's do ſtrangle in the ſame day, and in the ſecond, third, and fourth.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond ſort of Angina, though it be very dangerous, yet is it not altogether deadly as the firſt, becauſe the inflamation of the external Muſcles of the Larynx doth not make ſo great and ſo ſudden a conſtriction. Of this <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſpake 3. Prog. Text. 17. thus: <hi>Whatſoever Angina's do reſemble others in pain, and make a Tumor and redneſs in the Jaws, are very deadly, and are of longer conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance than others if they be very red.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:49088:84"/>The third kind is leſs dangerous, becauſe the Breath is leſs hindered than the Swallowing, from the inflamation of the internal muſcles of the Jaws: But the Swallow hurt is not ſo dangerous. Of this <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſpeaks in the Book above cited, Text. 18. in theſe words: <hi>If the Jaws and Neck are red, theſe Angina's continue longer; but they are chiefly preſerved who have red necks and breaſts, and the holy fire without, not within.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The fourth kind is leaſt and ſafeſt, becauſe the inflamation is furtheſt from the Throat. Hence <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> Aph. 37. Sect. 6. ſaith, <hi>If a Tumor appear in the neck in him that hath an Angina, it is good, for the Diſeaſe comes forth.</hi> He confirms the ſame in 3. Progn. Text. 20. thus; <hi>But it is moſt ſafe to have a Tumor or redneſs come forth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſeems to comprehend all theſe Differences in one Sentence, 6. Epid. Sect. 7. where ſpeaking of the ſigns of an Epidemical Angina, he ſaith: <hi>In the ſum of all, To them that could only not ſwallow, the diſeaſe was mild, and eaſie to be endured; but it was deſperate to them who had withal a difficulty of breathing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the matter cauſing the Angina be carried to the Lungs, either the Patients die, or elſe turn Fools, or Empyick, that is, impoſthumated between the Breaſt and Lungs; as <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> Aph. 10 Sect. 5. and 3. Progn.</p>
                     <p>In an Angina that is ſtrong, if the Patient foam at the mouth, it is deadly, Aph. 43. Sect. 2. for it ſhews a great ſtraitneſs about the Heart, and violent heat, from which the proper moiſture of the Lungs is ſqueezed forth, and carried to the mouth in a kind of froath.</p>
                     <p>They who have an Angina, if they ſpit not concocted matter, but a little, viſcid, ſlimy, and thick, are deſperate; <hi>Hipp. in coac.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Tumors of the Jaws in an Angina ſuddenly vaniſhing without reaſon are deadly, <hi>Hipp. in coacis.</hi> Without cauſe or reaſon, that is, without a precedent Evacuation by Art or Criſis; for it ſignifies the returning of the matter inward, from whence a more dangerous Diſeaſe may be in the internal parts; or as it ſomtimes fals out, the matter returning to the ſame part makes a ſudden ſuffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of the Angina is made by the ſame Indications which are obſerved in the Cure of all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamations, ſo the humor flowing to the part is to be revelled and repelled, that which is there is to be derived and diſſolved: But if it cannot be diſſolved, it is to be diſgeſted and ſuppurated; all which may be done as followeth:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, appoint a ſlender, cooling, and moiſtening Diet, of Barley, Cream, Chicken Broth, or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon Broath, with cool Herbs, and the like. If the Patient cannot ſwallow by reaſon of the narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Oeſophagus, ſo that from thence you fear loſs of ſtrength and death. You may free him from that danger by putting down a Catheter into the Oeſophagus, to which you may fit a Syringe by which you may ſend Broath into the Stomach. The Practical Phyſitians uſe nouriſhing Clyſters, by which ſome nouriſhment may be carried to the Liver from the Meſeraick Veins. Let his drink be Barley Water, and other things uſed in acute Feavers. Let the Air be temperate, and without extremity, for the cold will ſtop the pores, and the hot will encreaſe the defluxion and inflamation. The Patient muſt lie with his head high, and his neck upright, that he may better breath: he muſt avoid much ſleep, as in internal inflamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith, Blood runs inward in time of ſleep, and ſo the confluxion of humors to the part affected will be encreaſed.</p>
                     <p>But ſince Angina is a moſt acute Diſeaſe, and ſomtimes kills a man in one day, you muſt uſe great Remedies with much diligence. Therefore in what hour ſoever the Phyſitian comes, let him preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly let blood, on the ſame ſide that is affected, out of the Head Vein, or if that appear not, out of the Median, to a pound, or a pound and an half, or two pound, as much as his ſtrength will permit, for in this there is moſt hope; but you muſt not take all that blood away at once, leſt the Patient faint, by which he would be in danger; but by degrees, and intermiſſion, at every third or fourth hour. This kind of blood-letting is ſo neceſſary in this diſeaſe, that it may be hindered by no contrary indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. So in the flowing of the Terms, or at any other time you muſt take away blood in a great quantity. Of which we have a preſident in <hi>Zacutus Lucitanus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. Prax. admir. cap.</hi> 135. of a Woman which was in her ſeventh month great with Child, and was taken with a Squinzy: but being ſeven times let blood in one day was cured. If the Diſeaſe be not violent, you may firſt give a Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; but if otherwiſe, afterwards.</p>
                     <p>While Phlebotomy is iterated, make other revulſions in the ſame day with Cupping-glaſſes, both dry, and with ſcarrification upon the ſhoulders and loyns, make frictions and painful Ligatures upon the extream parts.</p>
                     <p>Having bled enough, fall to purging the next day, not expecting the concoction of humors, becauſe the diſeaſe admits of no parley; therefore give one proper to the humor, nay, if the diſeaſe do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain you, let blood, and give a purge, both in the ſame day; as <hi>Trallianus</hi> did by his confeſſion, <hi>Lib. 4. Cap.</hi> 1. in theſe words: <hi>I truly remember that I, when occaſion required, opened a Vein in
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:49088:85"/>
the morning under the Tongue, and at night gave a purge of the extract of Scammony in Broth, and could ſcarce hinder ſtrangulation for all that, and another the next day; after I had opened both the Arms, purged him again.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now your purge muſt be of gentle things, if the diſeaſe come of Choller, leſt the humors ſhould be moved too violently, and ſo come to the part affected. Alſo if the Inflamation come only of blood, it is better to abſtain altogether from purging. But if flegm run with it, make ſtronger Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and give Agarick, and Diaphoenicon with Senna; nay, in a ſtrong flegmatick Angina you may riſe to thoſe Medicines which cauſe violent vomiting, and among the reſt, the <hi>Aqua Benedicta</hi> of Dr. <hi>Rowland</hi> is the beſt, which given to the quantity of two ounces, doth wonders, and for the moſt part cureth the diſeaſe in the ſpace of two hours. Moreover, it hath no evil taſte, and ſo may eaſily be ſipped up, which you cannot do in other Medicines, which by reaſon of their evil taſte cannot be taken but at one draught by the Patient; therefore they can ſeldom be purged till the paſſages are a little opened. But that is ſupplied by often Clyſters, and therefore they who cannot take <hi>Aqua Benedicta Rulandi,</hi> by reaſon of its heat, or their weakneſs (becauſe they muſt be ſtrong who take it) nor any other Medicine, muſt uſe often Clyſters that are very ſharp to draw down the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors.</p>
                     <p>For the ſame Revulſion, it is good to apply Cupping-glaſſes to the Neck and Shoulders with ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification, Frictions, and Ligatures, to the lower parts, and to waſh their Feet with hot Water.</p>
                     <p>But a Veſicatory to the Neck behind, doth more ſtrongly revel the humors flowing from the head, which you muſt do preſently after blood-letting.</p>
                     <p>After Revulſions are ſufficiently and diligently made, you muſt derive the Humor from the part, and firſt open the Veins called <hi>Ranulae</hi> under the Tongue, it is commended by <hi>Hippocrates, Galen,</hi> and the Modern Phyſitians, by which the blood which doth immediately cauſe the inflamation, is drawn forth.</p>
                     <p>The Ancients in a deſperate Angina, open the Jugulars, which though ſome late Writers have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, yet it is out of faſhion, being thought dangerous by reaſon of the bleeding, which can ſcarcely be ſtopped by reaſon of the largeneſs of the Veins. But Experience hath taught that this operation is not ſo dangerous if it be well adminiſtred. Firſt then, bend the Patients Head on one ſide as much as you can til his chin almoſt touch his ſhoulder; then open the Vein without a Ligature, with a ſmal Orifice, according to its longitude, for ſo it will more eaſily cicatrize; and having taken a ſufficient quantity of blood, bring the Head to its natural poſition, and ſo ſomtimes the blood will ſtop of its ſelf. But you muſt preſently apply <hi>Galens</hi> Emplaſter deſcribed 5. <hi>Meth. Cap.</hi> 4. made of Hares hair, Aloes, Frankinſence, and the white of an Egg, ſo the flux of Blood is ſurely ſtopped. <hi>Trallianus</hi> reports in <hi>Lib. 4. Cap.</hi> 1. that he cured many of the Squinzy with opening of the Jugular Veins; and <hi>Zacutus Lucitanus, obſer. 89. lib. 1. Praxis admir.</hi> tells of a Spaniard which was cured of a moſt violent Angina.</p>
                     <p>A Cupping-glaſs with Scarrification under the Chin, is good for derivation, by which <hi>Zacutus Lucitanus, obſ. 88. lib. 1. Prax. adm.</hi> ſaith he cured a woman of a <hi>Cunagche,</hi> or dog Squinzy.</p>
                     <p>Scarrifications under the Jaws, and upon the Neck are good, if deep, by which means <hi>Benivenius</hi> faith in <hi>lib. de abdit. morb. cauſ. cap. 38. Nicholas Rota</hi> was cured of a deſperate Angina; whoſe ſtory <hi>Sennertus</hi> hath fully related, <hi>Pract. Med. lib. 2. part 1. cap.</hi> 24.</p>
                     <p>While the aforeſaid Medicines are uſed, the inflamation of the Throat and Jaws is to be allayed with Topicks, and they are to be varied according to the time, as in other inflamations, ſo in the firſt Repelling Medicines, are good made into Gargariſms that they may preſently touch the part infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Plantane, Nightſhade, and Woodbine Water, of each three ounces: Syrup of Mulber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries three ounces: Sal prunellae, one dram and an half. Make a Gargariſm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or of a Decoction thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Plantane, Sorrel, and the tops of Brambles, of each one handful: the Grains of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach half an ounce: one Pomegranate beaten with grains and peel: red Roſes one pugil: make a Decoction to a pint: Diſſolve in the ſtraining Syrup of Mulberries, and the compoſition made of Nuts, of each one ounce and an half; Sal prunella two drams: Make a Gargariſm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Concerning Gargariſms you muſt obſerve, that they are to be ſuſpected, becauſe the parts inflamed are moved thereby, which ſhould be at reſt; but you may remedy that if you hold the Gargariſm in the Mouth, turning backwards, and not move it.</p>
                     <p>Without Gargling you may uſe the Spirit of Salt, Sulphur, or Vitriol, which mixed with Water, to qualifie their ſharpneſs, are to be taken by little and little; for by paſſing through the part affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, they qualifie its heat, and being ſent from the Stomach to the Liver and Veins, it allaies the heat of the blood; which remedy is alſo good in the Inflamation of the Jaws and Tonſils.</p>
                     <p>While you uſe repelling Gargariſms, you muſt apply outwardly to the neck, looſning and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Liniments, that the matter may be brought forth; thus made.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="143" facs="tcp:49088:85"/>Take of <hi>Oyl of Chamomel, Lillies, and ſweet Almonds, of each one ounce: Hens greaſe and freſh Butter, of each one ounce and an half: Saffron one ſcruple: Make a Liniment to be applied with greazie wool.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Liniment will aſſwage pain, which if violent, it may be qualified alſo with a Gargariſm made of Milk, or an Emulſion made of the four cold great ſeeds, or of Mucilages of Fleabane and Quinces, drawn with Roſe water, adding Syrup of Violets, or Caſſia diſſolved in Whey, or in a Decoction of Marſh-mallow Roots.</p>
                     <p>After the beginning of the Diſeaſe when it encreaſeth, or is at a ſtand, you muſt mix Digeſters and Diſſolvers with Repellers, which muſt be done the ſecond day, becauſe the Diſeaſe is moſt acute.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Leaves of Hyſop and Plantane, of each one handful: Liquoris, Raiſons ſtoned, of each one ounce: fat Figs twelve: red Roſes and Barley, of each one pugil: make a Decoction of a pint. Diſſolve in the ſtraining Honey of Roſes, and Syrup of Violets, of each one ounce. Make a Gargariſm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Obſerve, That as long as the Inflamation continueth, you muſt mix ſome things that repel with Diſſolvers and Aſtringents, leſt the part which by Nature is ſoft, ſhould be more relaxed, and made more fit to receive a defluxion.</p>
                     <p>But outwardly you muſt apply Diſſolvers moſt, with a Swallows neſt, which by the Opinion of all Writers hath a ſpecifical property againſt this Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the pouder of a Swallows neſt, and of Album Graecum, of each one dram: the pouder of Flower-de-luce Roots and Chamomel, of each half a dram: Hens greaſe and Oyl of Lillies, of each one ounce, yellow Wax a little: Make a Liniment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or it may be made into a Cataplaſm thus:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>one Swallows neſt, Mallows, Violets, of each one handful: Althaea Roots, Lilly Roots, of each half an ounce: fat Figs three or four: Chamomel and Melilot Flowers, of each one pugil: boyl them and beat them; then put to them, Barley meal, Linſeeds, and Foenugreek, of each three drams: Saffron, one ſcruple: freſh Butter one ounce: Oyl of Chamomel and ſweet Almonds, of each as much as will make a Cataplaſm to be applied to the fore part of the Neck.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the mean while, you may uſe Eclegma's, or things to be licked, now and then, that the matter which breaths forth of the part, or falls upon it from the head, may be clenſed.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the pouder of the Electuary of Diatragacanth frigid, two drams: Simple Diaireos one dram: Sugar-candy, and Penides, of each half an ounce: Diamoron one ounce: Syrup of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jubes, as much as is ſufficient. Make a Lohoch.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the Tnmor will not be diſcuſſed, but tendeth to ſuppuration, which uſeth to be upon the fourth or fifth day, you ſhall aſſiſt it with the Cataplaſm aforeſaid, and other Emollients and Suppuratives, and he muſt hold thoſe Medicines at the ſame time in his mouth, which was preſcribed formerly for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaging of pain. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>ſliced Liquoris and Raiſons ſtoned, of each one ounce: fat Figs ſix: Althaea and Quince ſeeds, of each two drams: the flowers of Chamomel, one pugil: boyl them in Hydromel. Diſſolve in the ſtraining, boyled Wine two ounces. Make a Gargariſm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is alſo good to hold Caſſia new drawn, in the mouth, that by degrees it may diſſolve into the Throat, for it aſſwageth pain, diſſolveth and maturateth.</p>
                     <p>If the Tumor come to ſuppuration, which may be known by the decreaſe of ſymptomes, and will not break, let the ſick man, or ſome about him, put their fingers into his mouth, and endeavor to break the impoſthume, which if it cannot be done, let his mouth be wide opened with a <hi>Speculunt oris,</hi> and then open the impoſthume with a crooked inciſion knife called a Biſtort. Then let the Patient hold down his Head leſt the matter fall upon his Lungs: after, waſh the Ulcer with Barley Water and Honey of Roſes, Water and Honey called Hydromel, or Wine and Honey called Oino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel; after this, dry it up with Allum Water.</p>
                     <p>Others put a Wax Candle anointed with Oyl of ſweet Almonds into the Oeſophagus to break the Apoſthume; which if they cannot do, they uſe a ſharp wooden knife, or at laſt an inciſion knife.</p>
                     <p>Others touch it with Oyl of Vitriol, which preſently breaks it, <hi>Arcalanus</hi> opens it with a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet fixed at the end of a ſtick leſt it ſhould touch other parts. <hi>Faventinus</hi> commends the ſame, in theſe words; <hi>Take a little round ſtick, &amp; in the end of it, fix a little ſharp Iron as long as half a finger; then open the mouth, and put a ſtick between the Teeth, then let him open the impoſthume with the former Inſtrument: when it is open, let him bend forward with his mouth open, that the matter may come forth.</hi>

                        <hi>Schenkius</hi> out of <hi>Dovynetus,</hi> uſed to break an impoſthume with the Decoction of Agarick, and confirmeth it by the following Hiſtory taken out of <hi>Dovynetus, Apolog. lib. 3. cap. 1. A Noble Woman called</hi> Gabriella Goufier, <hi>Lady of</hi> Saulton, <hi>being taken with a Squinzie in Autumn, which
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:49088:86"/>
is moſt dangerous, I remembred that I read in</hi> Aetius, lib. 15. cap. 6. <hi>that Agarick doth deſtroy bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den impoſthumes, or draw them forth; preſently I took Agarick, and cut it and ſteeped it in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Althaea with the fourth part of white Wine, and Figs, and a little Ginger, with a little Syrup of Marſh-mallows, and gave it to the Lady to drink, commanding that ſhe ſwallow it not down ſuddenly, but hold it in the mouth a little, if ſhe would be cured: ſhe obeyeth, and while I was talking with her, behold abundance of white ſtinking matter came forth of her mouth, in ſo much that her daughter that held the Baſon fainted, the other people ran away, others came and took away the matter, others perfume the room; which done, I came to the Patient, and found her delivered from the impediment in her voyce, difficulty of breathing, and her feaver, and out of all danger.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the matter ſeem to tend to the external parts, you muſt open it outwardly; which <hi>Lanfrank</hi> ſaith he did with good ſucceſs, <hi>Chir. maj. doct. 2. tract. 3. cap. 5.</hi> in theſe words: <hi>Becauſe the Chyrurgeon is much confirmed by good experience, I will tell you what befel me in the City of</hi> Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane, <hi>with a Lady of fifty five yeers old, which had a flegmatick Squinzie in the whol Throat, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and outwardly, but outwardly it appeared moſt ſwoln, and ſhe could neither ſpeak nor ſwallow: being ſent for, I felt her pulſe, and found her exceeding weak; touching the part affected I found the matter very deep, and that ſhe was more likely to be choaked, than that it ſhould break either internally or externally: then I got ready my Rayſor, and touching the place with my ſingers I found ripe matter between the Chin and the Epiglot, and there I made a deep inciſion, by which I drew forth a great part of the corrupt matter, but willingly left a great deal behind, for a reaſon known; then her breath grew better, and pulſe ſtronger; then giving her Broath, a great deal of it came forth of the wound: then I invented a ſilver pipe which ſhould paſs the wound being put into the mouth, and by which ſhe ſhould receive her nouriſhment. I uſed Mundificatives, and Matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives to the whol Throat and Neck, till I drew out of the wound a great piece of viſcous matter, and ſtinking, like a Gut as long as my finger, which was condenſed by heat; which taken away, the place did no longer ſtink, and the Patient began to cheer up: but I continued to mundifie, and after with Incarnatives and Cicatrizers, I healed up the wound, and the Patient was cured.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here may be related the Hiſtory of <hi>Beniven</hi> before mentioned, of one in a Squinzy, who was left of other Phyſitians, and was cured by him with deep ſcarrification under the Jaws, and in the Neck, from whence much matter flowed.</p>
                     <p>If the Apoſthume break inwardly in the Mouth, let it be clenſed with Barley Water, and Hydromel (as is ſaid.) But ſomtimes the Ulcer is foul, and then you muſt uſe ſtronger, thus made:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Scabious and Agrimony, of each one handful: Cypreſsnuts one dram: Flowerde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luce Roots, and round Birthwort, of each half an ounce: Mirrh half a dram: red Roſes two pugils: boyl them in Hydromel to a pint; ſtrain it, and waſh the part ulcerated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Decoction is very good to clenſe Ulcer; but if it be not ſufficient, uſe the Collyrium of <hi>Lanfrank,</hi> which is wonderful.</p>
                     <p>After it is well clenſed, you muſt endeavor conſolidation with Bole-Anmenick mixed with Honey of Roſes for an Eclegma, with Frankinſence and Mirrh.</p>
                     <p>It comes to paſs ſomtimes that the Inflamation decreaſing, the Tumor will neither be diſſolved, nor ſuppurated, but grow harder; in which caſe you muſt Emollient and Suppurating Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplaſms, made thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Althaea, and Briony Roots, and of the wild Cucumer, of each one ounce: Mallows, Pellitory, Origan, and the leſſer Centaury, of each one handful: fat Figs, ſix or ſeven: Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed and Foenugreek, of each one ounce: Boyl them, beat them, and ſtrain them, and then ad of the pouder of a Sallows Neſt burnt, and of Album Graecum, of each three drams: Brimſtone one dram: freſh Butter, and Ducks Greaſe, of each one ounce: Oyl of Dill two ounces. Make a Cataplaſin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For a Concluſion, we will ſpeak ſomthing of <hi>Laryngotomia,</hi> or cutting of the Throat, which Ancient Phyſitians mentioned, and the Modern approve and confirm by experience: As when in a deſperate Squinzy when the Patient is almoſt choaked, an inciſion is made in the rough Artery, by which there is a paſſage for Air into the Lungs, and for vapors coming out of them.

                     <p>Moreover, In a deſperate Angina the Lungs are often affected, and full of humors, whence comes ſuffocation; and then the inciſion of the rough Artery will not profit.

But he confeſſeth it may be uſed, ſo that the Lungs and rough Artery be not full of filth: and he ſheweth the manner of it in its proper Chapter moſt exactly, from whence any one may take it.</p>

                        <hi>Chap. 1.</hi> Of <hi>Aſthma,</hi> or Difficulty of Breathing.</head>
                     <p>THe Breath is hindered by divers Cauſes, either by ſympathy, or propriety of part.</p>
                     <p>The hinderance of breathing by propriety called <hi>Idiopathica,</hi> comes from the Lungs diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, and therefore every Diſeaſe of the Lungs hurts their action, which Diſeaſes are either in the ſubſtance of the Lungs, or in the Veſſels thereof.</p>
                     <p>In the ſubſtance of the Lungs come inflamations, pimples, impoſthumes, ulcers, and ſomtimes a drying, and atrophy of the part; ſomtimes a ſerous watery humor is ſuckt into the ſpungy ſubſtance of the Lungs, and hinders their free dilatation; ſomtimes, though ſeldom, there is a ſchirrus, a ſtone, or hard ſwelling in them.</p>
                     <p>In the Veſſels of the Lungs, there are often obſtructions, which hindering the free paſſage of the Air, cauſe difficulty of breathing.</p>
                     <p>Breathing is hindered by ſympathy or conſent from other parts, which are not only neer, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, ſo the Membrane that goeth about the ribs being inflamed, or the Diaphragma, or Mediaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, the breath is hindered. So by cuſtom there is a great and often breathing when the heart is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, as in Feavers; and on the contrary, when the Heart is cold, as in dying men, it is diminiſhed
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:49088:87"/>
and ceaſeth; the ſame happeneth in ſwouning or ſyncope, when the action of the Heart, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Reſpiration ceaſeth.</p>
                     <p>So in the Empyema, or Dropſie of the Breaſt, when matter or water is collected in the Cavity of the Thorax, the Dilatation of the Lights, and Reſpiration is alſo hindered.</p>
                     <p>So the Muſcles of Breathing being hurt, hinder Reſpiration, as in wounds and tumors of them, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in an Apoplexy, when the influence of the Animal Spirits is kept from them.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, The Inflamation of the Muſcles of the Larynx makes difficulty of breathing in a Squinzy.</p>
                     <p>So alſo the Diſeaſes of the Hypochondria do hinder Reſpiration by conſent, as tumors of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Spleen, Sweetbread or Pancreas, do by their weight draw down the Diaphragma to which they are joyned, and ſo hinder the motion of it. Alſo vapors and wind ſent from thoſe parts compreſs the Diaphragma, and hinder its action, from whence comes a flatulent Aſthma. The ſame happeneth by the abundance of wind or water contained in the belly of an Hydropical man, and compreſſing the Diaphragma. Laſtly, Vapors coming from the Mother hinder Reſpiration, from whence this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is called, Suffocatio Hyſterica.</p>
                     <p>Among the aforeſaid hinderances of Reſpiration, the Aſthma is handled by it ſelf, becauſe the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther depend upon other Diſeaſes; they ſhall be mentioned in their places.</p>
                     <p>Although Aſthma uſed generally, comprehendeth in a large ſignification, all kinds of difficulty of breathing; yet it ſignifies more ſpecially that ſhortneſs of breathing which comes from the ſtuffing of the Lungs, and the obſtruction of the Bronchion, or Griſtles of the Wind-pipe; which of its ſelf eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially is without a Feaver, although ſomtimes it be joyned therewith. And again, it is ſubdivided into three other kinds; as firſt, <hi>Dyſpnoea;</hi> the ſecond called alſo <hi>Aſthma;</hi> the third <hi>Orthopnoea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dyſpnoea</hi> is a difficulty of breathing, in which the breath is drawn oftener and thicker, from the ſtuffing of the Lungs. This is leſs than Aſthma, or Orthopnoea, becauſe the matter obſtructing is leſs, and it rather ſtops the ſubſtance of the Lungs, than Griſtles or Bronchia: hence it is that there is no ſnorting at all, which comes from the commotion of the humors contained in the Bronchia, with the Air continually paſſing through.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aſthma</hi> is a great and often breathing, in which the Diaphragma, the Intercoſtal Muſcles between the Ribs, and of the Abdomen, are violently moved, joyned with ſnorting and wheeſing. For in a true Aſthma properly ſo called, the Btonchia of the Lungs are filled with flegm, which (as is ſaid) being moved by the Air, make that noiſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Orthopnoea</hi> is a great difficulty of breathing, in which the Patient cannot breath but ſitting, and with the neck extended upright; and the aforeſaid Muſcles are not only moved vehemently, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo thoſe of the Breaſt and Shoulders.</p>
                     <p>The names <hi>Dyſpnoea</hi> and <hi>Orthopnoea,</hi> as we ſaid of Aſthma, are uſed commonly for all difficulties of breathing, which happen in Pleureſies, or Inflamation of the Lungs, or the like.</p>
                     <p>The ſame may be ſaid of <hi>Apnaea,</hi> which doth not only ſignifie a depravation of breathing as the former, but alſo a diminiſhing or aboliſhing thereof; and this happeneth in ſyncope, Hyſterical Paſſions, and ſtrong Apoplexies.</p>
                     <p>The humor which cauſeth an Aſthma, is for the moſt part flegm, which falls from the Head into the Lungs, and obſtructs the Bronchia or Wind-pipe. Somtimes it comes from crude and ſerous humors brought by <hi>Arteria Venoſa</hi> into the Lungs, and if theſe flow to the Bronchia, they produce a true Aſthma with ſnorting; but if to the ſubſtance of the Lungs, or ſmooth Arteries, they cauſe a baſtard Aſthma without ſnorting.</p>
                     <p>This kind of Aſthma, which is unknown to vulgar Phyſitians (who will acknowledg no other cauſe but a defluxion from the Head) is confirmed, not only by not ſnorting, but from the thick and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent Urine of the Patient at that time, eſpecially in the ſit, becauſe ſome part of thoſe thick and crude humors in the Veins is ſent to the Reins and Bladder. And ſome Aſthmatical men are ſubject to ſtoppage of Urine, and when they are ſo, they are free from it. But when the fit of the Aſthma comes, the difficulty of Urine ceaſeth, becauſe the matter of the diſeaſe contained in the Veins goes from one place to another: We have alſo ſeen ſome ſubject to a flux in the Belly, who while they were ſo, were free from the Aſthma; but when that ſtopped, the Aſthma returned. Moreover, this kind of Aſthma which is without ſnorting, is ſo directly oppoſite to bleeding, that when a Vein is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the fit, as ſoon as it bleedeth, the Patient begins preſently to breath better, and in the end, or after a little ſpace, they are cured of their fit. And finally, theſe kind of Aſthmatical men, are for the moſt part of an ill habit of body, and have an oedematous humor in their feet, which ſheweth that the cauſe of the Aſthma at that time came from the Liver, and is contained in the Veins, ſo that ſomtimes a Dropſie followeth in many. Hence <hi>Aretaeus</hi> reckoneth a wind in the Midriff, and bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings, without reaſon among the ſigns of an Aſthma at hand, which certainly do come from a crude matter moved in the Midriff.</p>
                     <p>That flatulent matter doth of its ſelf ſomtimes produce another kind of Aſthma, which is called
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:49088:88"/>
                        <hi>Aſthma flatulentum,</hi> or <hi>Hypochondriacum;</hi> when many thick vapors riſing from the Hypochondria, do compreſs the Diaphragma, and hinder its motion, whence comes great difficulty of breathing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſnorting.</p>
                     <p>The Knowledg of this Diſeaſe, and its kinds, may be by what hath been ſaid.</p>
                     <p>In a Diſpnoea, the breath is thick, without noiſe or anhelation, and with leſs trouble.</p>
                     <p>In an Aſthma the Breaſt is more heavy, the Breath thicker and quicker, with anhelation, ſnorting, and wheeſing.</p>
                     <p>But in Orthopnoea, the Patient cannot breath but with his neck upright, and if they lie down, they are ready to be choaked.</p>
                     <p>The Signs of the Cauſes are theſe:</p>
                     <p>If Aſthma come from groſs humors gathered in the Lungs, the difficulty of breathing comes by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, by little and little, and is continual.</p>
                     <p>But if Humors come at a diſtance from other parts into the Lungs, the difficulty of breathing is not continual For albeit Aſthma which comes from matter contained in the Lungs, uſeth to be encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by external cauſes, as Anger, Southernly winds, and the like; yet in Aſthma which comes from matter flowing from another part, the encreaſe is more manifeſt. If this matter come from the brain, there is a manifeſt Catarrh; but if no ſigns of a Cararrh appear, you muſt conjecture that the matter comes by the Veins to the Lungs, and the ſwelling of the feet, and evil habit of body called <hi>Cachexia,</hi> is a ſign that the Liver is affected.</p>
                     <p>If a thick humor be contained in the Bronchia of the Lungs, the Reſpiration is with noiſe and cough; as alſo by ſpitting the diſeaſe ceaſeth, or is diminiſhed.</p>
                     <p>If the Humor be in the Veins, or ſubſtance of the Lungs, there is no noiſe, and there is ſeldom any ſpitting by Cough.</p>
                     <p>As to the Prognoſtick. An Aſthma is a Chronical diſeaſe, and very hard to be cured, and often ends in a Cachexia or Dropſie. Yong men are ſomtimes cured, and not without great labor, but old men never. Infants except they be ſpeedily cured, die by a Catarrh, which followeth:</p>
                     <p>They who grow crooked upon an Aſthma or Cough, die before they come to ripeneſs of age, becauſe the gibboſity hindereth the convenient growth of the breaſt, nevertheleſs get their due encreaſe and bigneſs, but having not room enough to dilate themſelves; from whence the heat of the Heart being not ſufficiently fanned, the patient dieth.</p>
                     <p>A Pleureſie, or Peripneumonia commg upon an Aſthma, is deadly, becauſe the Lungs being weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a long diſeaſe, cannot reſiſt ſo great a diſeaſe coming thereupon, and expel the matter.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of the Aſthma is two-fold. namely, in the Paroxyſme, and out or it.</p>
                     <p>In the fit, preſently you muſt open a Vein, a Clyſter being given, if the blood do ſeem any way to abound: for when the Veins are empty of blood, the Reſpiration is more free. But if the diſeaſe be elder, and blood hath been often drawn, it is better to abſtain from bleeding, becauſe by diminiſhing the natural heat, it will encreaſe flegm.</p>
                     <p>It is good to open the Veins in the Ancles in this diſeaſe, coming by conſent from other parts.</p>
                     <p>After bleeding, or if it be omitted as not thought fit, you muſt purge flegm, with the things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the Cure of the cold diſtemper of the brain, putting to them alwaies things proper for the breaſt as much as may be.</p>
                     <p>Vomits, althongh diſallowed by ſome in this diſeaſe, yet are they moſt convenient, as frequent experience hath taught, and ſomtimes the ſit is taken away with a vomit only.</p>
                     <p>Among theſe the chief is <hi>Aqua Nicotiana,</hi> or Tobacco Water. given in the quantity of an ounce; and it may be made into a Syrup with Sugar: In want whereof you may uſe the Salt of Vitriol, <hi>Aqua benedicta Rulandi.</hi> Now the reaſon is excellent why Vomits do ſo much good in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. For while the thin humor falling from the head inſinuateth it ſelf into the Aſpera Arteria, and the Bronchia of the Lungs; and the thick falls into the Stomach, and is there ſo fixed that it can ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be taken away. And while the weak heat of the Stomach doth ſtir the matter, thick vapors are produced, which puffing up the Stomach, compreſs the Diaphragma, and cauſe difficulty of brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Hence it comes that when the Stomach is emptied, the fit ceaſeth, or is much leſs. Moreover, An Aſthma ſomtimes (nay often, according to <hi>Sennertus</hi>) cometh of crude humors about the Liver, and in the Veins, which are carried by the <hi>Vena Arterioſa</hi> into the Lungs, and compreſs the Bronchia, from whence cometh an Aſthma. For the evacuating and revelling of theſe humors from the Lungs, a Vomit is very good. As alſo for this cauſe, the Remedies purging humors downward are very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent.</p>
                     <p>The Juyce of our Flowerdeluce, doth gently move and purge downward, taken to the quantity of half an ounce, with one ounce of Hippocras, which <hi>Placerus</hi> in his Obſervations ſaith he hath uſed with good ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>You may give two ounces of the juyce of Flowerdeluce, if the former did work ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently.</p>

                     <p>You muſt alſo uſe Frictions to the inferior parts, and apply many Cupping-glaſſes thereon, as alſo to the Neck. Afterwards you muſt extenuate and diſſolve the thick humors, and diſcuſs the vapors that come from them.

Let him take a Porrenger full every morning; in which let him diſſolve Manna and new drawn Caſſia, of each half an ounce, continuing it for a month and longer; which will be the better, if preſently after he take a dram of Turpentine with Penides in form of a Bolus, or otherwiſe.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ludovicus Septalius</hi> in his Practical Obſervations condemneth theſe Cock-broths as unprofitable, or hurtful: His Reaſons are, Becauſe they do not anſwer Experience, and have been uſed in vain by him and other Phyſitians of <hi>Millane.</hi> For by long boyling, the nitrous parts (by which thoſe Broths are thought moſt to profit) do ſettle, and are loſt in the ſtraining: but the ſlimy, glutinous, thick, and fatty, from the skin, feet, wings, muſculous and nervous parts do remain. Hence the matter is made thicker, and leſs fit to be expectorated.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Septalius</hi> his Experience, muſt not be preferred before ſo many famous Phyſitians Experience, both old and modern. For if it did not profit ſome which he and others have cured, many other things might hinder, as namely, the evil diſpoſition of the Patient, and contumacy of the diſeaſe, or other things not well ordered which concerned the Cure, or the Medicine it ſelf not well made. And whereas he ſaith, that the nitrous parts do fall to the bottom by long boyling, and are loſt in the ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, it is ridiculous; for only the Earthy parts do ſettle, but the nitrous part once taken into the liquor, is never ſeparated. Hence it is that the longer you boyl Broth the Salter it is. But this Salt doth cut, extenuate, and open, it is ſo far from incraſſating being ſalt. Neither hath the fleſh, or other parts of a Cock, ſuch a glutinous ſubſtance as he imagineth, as you may find in Neats feet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Calves feet, but rather an attenuating quality, becauſe it is full of nitrous ſubſtance. And if purging and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Medicines be made according to the Precepts of Pharmacy and Art, they do leave all their ſtrength in the Decoction, becauſe dayly Experience teacheth us that ſuch Broth of an old Cock doth purge. And if we may oppoſe our Experience to that of <hi>Septalius,</hi> we can truly ſay, that we have found admirable effects of theſe Broths in violent Aſthmaes and Chollicks. But this we uſe to alter in theſe Broths; We give many draughts in a day leſt it ſhould be ſpoiled by keeping. But this is the Example of what we preſcribe in this diſeaſe:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Roots of Elicampane and Flowerdeluce, of each one dram and an half: Hyſop and Coltsfoot, of each one handful: Liquoris and Raiſons ſtoned three drams: fat Figs four: Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na three drams: Polipody of the Oak and Carthamus ſeeds bruiſed, of each half an ounce: Annis ſeeds one dram and an half: Boyl them with the third or fourth part of an old Cock: make a Broth for twelve or fifteen daies.</hi>

                     <p>We have ſaid that in a true Pleuriſie not only the Membrane Pleura, but alſo the internal Muſcles are inflamed, becauſe it is impoſſible but the Inflamation of the Membrane ſhould be communicated to the contiguous Muſcles.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, Others do affirm that the Lungs are inflamed in every Pleuriſie, and confirm their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Authority, Reaſon, and Experience: The Authority is that of <hi>Hippocrates, lib. de loc. in homine,</hi> where he ſaith, That a Peripneumonia is when both parts of the Lungs are inflamed; but if only one part be inflamed, it is a Pleuriſie. Alſo Reaſon may ſeem to confirm this, for the ſigns of a Pleuriſie are alſo the ſigns of Peripneumonia; namely, a Cough, continual Feaver, difficulty of Breathing, and ſpetting of Blood.</p>
                     <p>Alſo the Prognoſtick and Cure is the ſame in both.</p>
                     <p>They ſay moreover, That they have found by experience in the opening of thoſe who have died of Pleuriſies that their Lungs appeared alwayes to be inflamed.</p>
                     <p>It is to be granted that in many the Lungs are affected as wel as the Pleura, for the Defluxion may eaſily fal upon both; becauſe the Lungs are faſtened to the upper part of the Pleura: but we muſt avouch that often the Pleura alone is only affected, and not the Lungs: or at leaſt they are ſo lightly affected, that the Diſeaſe cannot be ſaid to be an affect of that part. The Authority of <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> in this, is caſt off by ſome as falſe, and contrary to many of his own Aſſertions, in which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth the Pleura only as the part affected; eſpecially in his 1. <hi>lib. de morbis.</hi> where he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſaith, That Choller and Flegm do ſtick to the ſide, and cauſe vehement pain. But <hi>Mortiamis</hi> doth reconcile this; ſaying, That <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſpeaks in that place of a Peripneumonia which comes of a Defluxion from the Head, a portion whereof fals upon the Pleura, and he cals it by the name of a Pleuriſie, that he may diſtinguiſh that which inflameth one part of the Lungs, from that which inflameth both: For the ſame nature of a Diſeaſe being in both the Pleuriſie and Peripneumonia, makes the likeneſs of Symptoms in both, being both from inflamation, and nearly adjoyned.</p>
                     <p>And though many who have died of Pleuriſies, have been found to have their Lungs affected, it is not to be concluded that it is ſo in al; for the moſt vehement Pleuriſies which uſe to cauſe-Death, do many times turn into a Peripneumonia. But many do witneſs, and we have found by experience, That in many bodies dead of Pleuriſies, the Pleura only hath been found putrified.</p>
                     <p>It may be queſtioned, Why the Pleura, rather than other Membranes, ſhould be inflamed? But the Anſwer is from <hi>Hippocrates, 1. de morb. text.</hi> 124. according to the Diviſion of <hi>Salius,</hi> where he ſaith, That the ſide is a very weak part, becauſe it is naked from fleſh in reſpect of other parts, and hath nothing to reſt upon; therefore when the humors are moved and inflamed, their Defluxion is eaſily ſent thither.</p>
                     <p>The matter Cauſing a Pleuriſie is for the moſt part Chollerick Blood which doth eaſily penetrate a thick Membrane; As <hi>Avicen</hi> ſpeaking of a Pleuriſie, ſaith, Except the Humor be thin and Chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick it cannot pierce into the Membrane. Other Humors may alſo Cauſe this Diſeaſe ſo they have a ſerous Chollerick Humor mixed with them for a Vehicle: I ſay other Humors not Excrementiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous but Natural, which are contained in the form of blood, and are called either blood it ſelf, or blood that is wateriſh, or melancholly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="153" facs="tcp:49088:90"/>But you muſt note, that thin Humors make a true Pleuriſie, and thick, a Baſtard Pleuriſie.</p>
                     <p>Now this blood is carried by the Veſſels which nouriſh the Breaſt, eſpecially the <hi>Vena Axillaris,</hi> and <hi>Azygos;</hi> and if it offend either in quantity, quality, or motion, it is caſt upon the Membrane and Muſcles adjoyning.</p>
                     <p>The Difference of Pleuriſies is taken from the part affected, and the Cauſes.</p>
                     <p>In reſpect of the place of the pain, it is divided by <hi>Hipp. 2. acutor.</hi> into an aſcending Pleuriſie, namely, when the pain reacheth more to the Throat; and a deſcending Pleuriſie, when it goeth down to the Hypochondria. Somtimes it is extended more towards the back, of which <hi>Hipp. 3. de morbis</hi> makes mention; and ſomtimes it comes more forward.</p>
                     <p>In reſpect of the Cauſe and the Humor offending, it is called either Sanguineous, coming of blood, Chollerick, Phlegmatick, or Melanchollick.</p>
                     <p>There is alſo another excellent Difference made by <hi>Hippocrates, 1. acut.</hi> where a Pleuriſie is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into a dry and a moiſt Pleuriſie. A dry one is that in which there is little or no ſpitting, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the beginning, but continuance of the Diſeaſe; of which there are divers Cauſes, as the Crudity of the matter, the thickneſs and ſlim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>neſs thereof, the weakneſs of the faculty, the obſtruction of the Bronchia, or the vehemency of pain. But a moiſt Pleuriſie is that in which there is abundance of ſpittle, from the beginning of the diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>The Diagnoſis or knowledg of this Diſeaſe, is by the ſigns, as ſaith <hi>Galen, 5. de loc. aff. cap.</hi> 8. and elſwhere; who reckoneth Five.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1 A pricking pain of the ſide.</item>

                     </list>
                     <p>A pricking pain is chiefly in the Membranes, and comes from a Chollerick matter, and this pain poſſeſſing the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>de, ſtretcheth it ſelf into the parts adjacent, one while to the Throat, another while to the Hypochondria, by the continuity of the Membrane, which covers the whol Cavity of the Breaſt. By this ſign a Pleuritis is diſtinguiſhed from a Peripneumonia, in which there is no pain, or very little of the ſide, except it be joyned with a Pleuriſie.</p>
                     <p>A continual ſharp Feaver hath its original from a Fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>gmon or Sanguineous tumor in ſome part neer the Breaſt, and therefore is ſymptomatical: although ſomtimes an eſſential Feaver be joyned with a Pleuriſie; and gives it ſomtimes a being, for it often happeneth in the beginning of continual Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, that the blood boyling in the veins is expelled by Nature unto ſome part which is moſt fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it; as the ſides, and there it breeds an inflamation. The ſign of this is, That the Feaver firſt ſeizeth upon the Patient, and the ſecond or third day after the pain is in the ſide. But when the Feaver is ſymptomatical, then the pain in the ſide comes firſt, but the Feaver a little after.</p>
                     <p>Difficulty of breathing doth neceſſarily follow in this diſeaſe, becauſe the parts inflamed cannot ſufficiently diſtend themſelves to draw in a great quantity of Air, which is requiſite for the cooling of an inflamed heart.</p>
                     <p>The Pulſe is hard becauſe the Membrane is affected, and ſtretched forth, which alſo diſtendeth the Arteries, and they therefore make that difference of pulſe, called <hi>Serratilis,</hi> like a ſaw; for when you lay many fingers upon the Arteries of the Pulſe, one part ſeems to be more lifted up than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo that it ſeems to repreſent a ſaw.</p>
                     <p>A troubleſom Cough follows a Pleuriſie, becauſe Nature doth continually ſtrive to expel that which is troubleſom from the part affected: as alſo ſome of the matter ſweateth from thence into the Lungs, which moveth the expulſive faculty, whence the Cough cometh.</p>
                     <p>There is alſo a ſpitting of blood as another ſign, which is neither in al Pleuriſies, nor at al times of the Diſeaſe; therfore it is not reckoned as a proper ſign. They who ſay that the Lungs are alwaies affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in a Pleuriſie, do affirm that the blood is ſpit from the Lungs, and they deny that it can paſs from the Membrane about the Ribs to the Lungs, becauſe it is very thick; and alſo the Membrane about the Lungs is of the ſame Nature, and cannot therefore be pierced by that blood which is without the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. But <hi>Galen</hi> doth cleerly confute theſe, 5. <hi>de loc. aff. cap.</hi> 3. where he firſt, ſhews that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contained in the Cavity of the Breaſt may be taken into the Lungs, and be ſent upwards, by two cleer Examples. The one is thoſe who have received a wound in the Breaſt that pierceth into its Cavity; for if an injection of Honey and Wine be made into the wound, and it be preſently cloſed at the orifice, in a little time the injection will be coughed up and ſpit forth, and the Patient wil have the taſte of it in his mouth. Another Example is taken from a Fracture of a bone, when the skin is not broken; which while the Callus is growing, and the broken bones begin to glutinate, that blood which flowed to the part affected is carried forth to the skin, and goeth through it, ſo that it moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and fouleth all the rowlers and ligatures about the part. <hi>Galen</hi> alſo ſhews the manner how blood, matter, or the like, being contained in the Cavity of the Breaſt may be taken through the lungs,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:49088:91"/>
namely, by the extream outward orifices of the Bronchia or branches of the rough Artery, which are ſpread through the Lungs, and end in the ſuperficies of them.</p>
                     <p>Although the orifices of the Vein Arterial, and Artery Venal are alſo carried to the ſuperficies of the Lungs, yet the orifices of the Bronchia are more large and open than they. For by how much greater the Body or Trunk of the rough Artery is, than the Trunk of the Venal Artery, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rterial Vein, by ſo much the greater are its branches than theirs; and its orifice than theirs; becauſe all theſe Veſſels are equally divided and diſtributed into the whol body of the Lungs. Moreover, the ſubſtance of the rough Artery, and its Bronchia or branches, are Cartilaginous or griſly, from whence it is that they cannot clo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But <hi>Galen</hi> teacheth that the matter contained in the Breaſt is taken through at the time of brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, when the Thorax is ſtraightened; for then the Thorax doth preſs thoſe things that are in the Cavity of it, and drive them into the Lungs, ſo that ſome part of them at leaſt is carried into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifice of the Bronchia. Neither is the ſoftneſs of the Lungs, which yeild to a compreſſion, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be forced to receive the matter, any hinderance. For this ſoftneſs is the cauſe why all the matter is not received; yet it is no obſtacle but ſome part thereof may be received in, although the greateſt remain in the Cavity by reaon of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>A baſtard Pleureſie is diſtinguiſhed from a true, in that the pain is encreaſed when the Patient lieth on the contrary ſide, in a true Pleuriſie; for then the part inflamed is pulled, and more diſtended by its own weight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in the other, the Muſcles external being inflamed, are compreſſed when the Patient lieth on the ſame ſide, and therefore he hath then greater pain.</p>
                     <p>The times of this Diſeaſe, are known by theſe ſigns following:</p>
                     <p>In the beginning of it, all the ſymptomes are weaker, the pain and feaver ſmal, there is a dry Cough, and very little and crude ſpittle: In the encreaſe of the Diſeaſe, the feaver and pain encreaſe, and there is more ſpittle. In the ſtate or height the ſymptomes are more vehement, want of reſt, dotage, pain of the Head; and if the diſeaſe will be cured, there is much concocted ſpittle eaſily rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. In the declination, the ſpittle is perfectly concocted, a free ſpitting, and decay of all ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes.</p>
                     <p>The ſigns of the Cauſes, are generally taken from the temper of the Patient, the time of the yeer, the Country, the Diet, and the like. But eſpecially the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e things ſhew that a Pleuriſie comes of pure blood, red and bloody ſpittle, a ſtretching and pricking pain, the fulneſs of the Veins, eſpecially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Forehead and Temples, redneſs of the whol face, a full Pulſe, thick and red urine, ſomtimes with a blew crown.</p>
                     <p>Theſe ſigns ſhew that it comes from Chollerick blood, yellow ſpittle, a burning feaver, great thirſt, a hard and quick pulſe, a more acute pricking pain, greater watchings and reſtleſneſs, bitterneſs of the mouth, a thin and very yellow urine.</p>
                     <p>Theſe ſigns ſhew that it comes from Flegmatick blood, a white, viſcous, or frothy ſpittle, ſweet and ſlow in coming forth, a remiſs feaver, little thirſt, much ſpittle, a le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The Prognoſtick is taken firſt from the remiſſion or vehemency of the Symptomes. For if pain, difficulty of breathing, and a feaver be not great, they ſignifie that the diſeaſe is gentle; but if the pain be great, and the Cough, and there is nothing ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>A ſmal pulſe, quick, and hard, foreſhew death in a Pleuriſie. And <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith that none of this have been cured; <hi>Gal. 4. de praeſag<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ex pulſ. cap.</hi> 5.</p>
                     <p>An exquiſite Pleuriſie in which nothing is raiſed by Cough, or when with the ſpitting after it began, is reſtrained, having ſtill the pain and weight in the ſide, is moſt dangerous. For it ſignifieth a very crude diſeaſe, which will either ſhortly kill, or be long in cure.</p>

                     <p>Very bloody ſpittle is dangerous; for it ſignifieth a ruption, either of a Vein, or of the fleſh; from whence we expect ſuppuration: For it is thought that little blood doth breath through.</p>

Sect. 6. which we muſt underſtand of a Pleuriſie, in which there is ſo great an inflamation that the Liver and Stomach conſent therewith, or when the ſtrength is ſo gone by the diſeaſe that the retentive faculty is almoſt ſpent. But if the Pleuriſie be not ſo great, and be in a body full of evil humors, the flux of the belly uſeth then to be healthful, eſpecially if any ſigns of concoction went before.</p>
                     <p>A Chollerick and plentiful vomiting in the beginning of a Pleuriſie ſignifieth health to come: For Nature being eaſed by that evacuation of Choller, doth more eaſily overcome the diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>If a Peripneumonia comes from a Pleuriſie, 'tis evil; Aph. 11. Sect. 7. For it is the tranſlation of the matter to a more noble part.</p>

                     <p>A Pleuriſie which followeth an old diſeaſe, or is in a body of evil habit, is dangerous.</p>

                        </gap>t appear crude, flegmy, or watery, it is to be continued every day, ſomtimes twice a day till it appear red or yellowiſh. But if it appear red in the beginning, you muſt bleed ſo often till it become livid or black, for that will ſignifie, that the laſt blood came from the part affected, or the neighbor Veins, which is altered by the part inflamed, and of crude is made red, or of red, black or blew by aduſtion.</p>
                     <p>Although the obſervation of that Rule bring commonly good ſucceſs, yet ſomtimes you muſt not expect that change of color, but deſiſt from bleeding; namely, when the ſtrength is little, or the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is of a thin habit of body eaſily diſſolved, or the weather very hot. And although blood-let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is excellent in the beginning of the Diſeaſe, yet if it be omitted, or done inſufficiently, you may open a Vein after the ſeventh, ninth, or eleventh day, according to the Example of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> who in 3. Epidem. opened a vein for Anaxion in the eighth day, either becauſe he was not ſent for ſooner, or becauſe that it was a moſt crude Pleuriſie, which will ſcarce concoct till the eleventh day.</p>
                     <p>But when he expectorateth freely, then you muſt abſtain from Phlebotomy, which will ſtop his ſpitting, and bring him in danger of his life.</p>
                     <p>But blood-letting is ſo neceſſary in the beginning of this Diſeaſe, that it muſt never be omitted, neither in old nor yong, nor women with child, in child-bed, or having their terms; unto all which Experience hath taught us that Phlebotomy is good in this Diſeaſe. Yet you muſt obſerve ſome

Rules in bleeding of women in Child-bed, or having their Terms, which you may find hereafter in the Fifteenth Book, and the laſt Chapter, concerning the Cure of acute Diſeaſes in women that lie inn.</p>
                     <p>From the beginning of the diſeaſe twice or thrice in a day, you muſt give cooling Juleps, which reſtrain the heat and boyling of the humor, and ſtop the defluxion; thus made:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Poppy Water four ounces: Syrup of Violets, or Poppies, one ounce: Sal prunella one dram. Make a Julep.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After the firſt Phlebotomy let the ſide be anointed with this Liniment, covering the part with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy wool ſewed into a linnen cloth.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Oyl of Lillies, Chamomel, and ſweet Almonds, of each one ounce: freſh Butter, and Hens greaſe, of each one ounce and an half. Make a Liniment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Many put Wax to theſe Liniments, which is not good, becauſe it ſtoppeth the pores; but the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilaginous bodies do not, becauſe they cool and aſtringe.</p>
                     <p>In a malignant peſtilential Pleuriſie, you may ad to your Liniments, Oyl of Scorpions of <hi>Mathio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> or a little Treacle.</p>

                     <p>Many other Topicks are very profitable againſt Pleuriſies, which Authors relate; as theſe:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, anoint the part with Oyntment of Marſh-mallows, then lay on the pouder of Cummin ſeed, or a Colewort Leaf heat at the fire, and anointed with the ſame.</p>

                        <hi>Faventinus</hi> mixeth the Oyntment of Althaea with Oyl of ſweet Almonds, and after he hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed, ſprinkles on the pouder of Cummin ſeeds, and laieth on a Colewort Leaf; and this he commends highly.</p>
                     <p>Alſo the Cataplaſm following is very profitable.</p>
                     <p>Take the <hi>Reſidency or Ingredients of the Decoction above mentioned for a Fomentation; beat them in a ſtone Morter, adding of the Oyl of ſweet Almonds, Lillies, and Chamomel, of each two ounces: Hens greaſe one ounce: Barley and Bean flower, of each as much as is ſufficient to make a Cataplaſm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Alſo a live Hen ſlit through the back, and ſprinkled with the pouder of Flowerdeluce roots, being applied doth very well.</p>
                     <p>The Paunch of a Sheep laid hot to the part is a very good Anodine: but the Lungs are better.</p>
                     <p>The Chymical Oyl of Wax being mixt with the Liniments, aſſwageth pain, and powerfully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſeth the matter.</p>
                     <p>Hot Bread from the Oven, dipt in freſh Butter, and applied, doth very much diſſolve the matter fixed to the ſide.</p>
                     <p>After he hath taken twice or thrice of the Julep aforeſaid, you may uſe Pectoral Juleps thus made:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Barley one pugil: Liquoris and Raiſons ſtoned, of each one ounce: Jujubes twenty: the four great cold Seeds, of each three drams: Bugloſs and Violet flowers, of each one pugil: boyl them to a pint and a quarter.

                     </p>
                     <p>Or if the Feaver be very ſharp, and much watching, you may make the Emulſions following:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Almonds blanched, and ſteeped in cold Water, one ounce: the four great cold ſeeds, of each half an ounce: Lettice and white Poppy ſeeds, of each two drams: beat them in a marb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </p>
                     <p>Some Practitioners in want of ſleep give Narcoticks; as Syrup of Poppies, <hi>Philonium Romanum,</hi> and Laudanum, which are dangerous in this diſeaſe: for they ſtop ſpitting, and aſtringe and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the Breaſt.

                     <p>But this muſt be underſtood of the whol doſe of Narcoticks: for given in a very ſmal quantity they do good in vehement pain, a thin defluxion which cauſeth a Cough, and in want of ſleep. In which caſes I have often given one grain of Laudanum with good ſucceſs, and ſomtimes often. But the uſe of this is moſt proper in the beginning of the diſeaſe; for then the humor flowing to the part may be

reſtrained, and the encreaſe of the Diſeaſe hindered.</p>
                     <p>When the Cough is violent, and Nature begins to evacuate by ſpirting, let the Patient hold often in his mouth Sugar of Roſes, Sugar candy or Penides, or the Tablets of Diatragacanth frigid, Syrup of Violets and Jujubes. Or this Eclegma following:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Sugar candy, and Penides, of each one ounce: the pouder of Diatragacanth frigid two drams: Syrup of Violets and Jujubes, of each as much as will make a Lohoch; which let him take often with a Liquoris ſtick, or make it of Butter, Honey, and Sugar, of each equal parts: the Oyl of Linſeed, or of ſweet Almonds, being freſh drawn without fire, mixed with Sugar, doth much help the Cough and pain in the Pleuriſie, eſpecially if it be drunk in Broth, or any other Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>

                     <p>You muſt take theſe lying with the face upwards, for ſo they better go to the Lungs.</p>
                     <p>As the Diſeaſe encreaſeth, you may uſe this reſtoring Medicine to ſtrengthen.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Purging is improper in a true Pleuriſie, except it be in the declination; and then you may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point this:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Senna half an ounce: Annis ſeeds one dram: Bugloſs and Maiden-hair, of each half a handful: Liquoris and Raiſons ſtoned, of each three drams: the flowers of Bugloſs and Violets, of each one Pugil. Boyl them to two ounces: in the ſtraining, diſſolve of Rhubarb infuſed in Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious Water with a little yellow Sanders, four ſcruples: the beſt Manna, and Syrup of Roſes, of each one ounce. Make of theſe a Potion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the whol time of the diſeaſe, let him take Barley Water for his ordinary drink, made with Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoris, Poppies, and Maiden-hair; and let not his drink be actually cold, for it would hurt the Breaſt.

                     <p>In the declination of the Diſeaſe, after purging, and when the Feaver is leſs, if the pain continue, you may apply to the part, Cupping-glaſſes with Scarrification two daies together.

                     <p>Horſ-dung diſſolved in Carduus Water, and ſtrained, doth powerfully diſperſe the pain, and the humor in the Pleuriſie.</p>
                     <p>White Hen-dung given in a dram of the ſame Water, doth as much.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Dungs have much Volotile Salt, which is very piercing and diſcuſſing.</p>

                     <p>The Blood of a wild Goat given to ten drops with the aforeſaid Water, doth powerfully diſcuſs the Pleuriſie: In the want thereof, you may give the blood of a tame Goat. But becauſe the ſtrength of him is little, you may give thereof to the quantity of one dram. You muſt prepare it thus:</p>
                     <p>Hang up the Goat by the Horns, and bend his hinder Legs backward to his Horns, then cut out his Stones, and take the Blood in a broad Veſſel; dry it in the Sun in Summer, or at other times upon an Oven. It is far different from the Goats Blood in the Shops.</p>

                        <hi>Chap. 3.</hi> Of <hi>Peripneumonia,</hi> or Inflamation of the Lungs.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>PEripneumonia</hi> hath the ſame eſſence with a Pleuriſie, and is diſtinguiſhed only by the part affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, becauſe that is the inflamation of the Lungs, and this of the Membrane that compaſſeth the Ribs. They differ ſomwhat in the matter, for a Pleuriſie comes often of Choller, but a Perip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neumonia of Flegm; although all humors (as we ſaid of a Pleuriſie) may produce this diſeaſe, I mean humors which are like blood, and make up the maſs of it. For as thick humors do hardly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate the thick Membrane called <hi>Pleura,</hi> but thin and Chollerick eaſily; ſo on the other ſide, thick flegmatick humors do eaſily go to the ſoft and thin ſubſtance of the Lungs, and ſtick cloſe thereto; but thin and Chollerick humors do eaſily paſs by. But this hindereth not, but the Chollerick blood may ſomtimes cauſe the Inflamation of the Lungs, as <hi>Hippocrates 1. de morbis,</hi> deſcribeth the Ery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipelas, or Chollerick tumor of the Lungs, which comes from Chollerick blood thrown into the Lungs from the right Ventricle of the Heart by the Arterial Vein. But an oedematous Inflamation comes from flegmatick blood falling upon the Lungs by way of defluxion from the Head. But only excrementitious flegm, falling as a Catarrh from the Brain, can make a Peripneumonia, becauſe it putrifieth in the Lungs, and attracteth blood, by the mixture whereof there is an Inflamation, and this often happeneth in old folk. <hi>Meſue</hi> ſaith that this Peripneumonia comes rather of Choller, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lungs are nouriſhed with Chollerick blood which cometh in great plenty to them by the Arterial Vein. To whom we anſwer, that freſh, thin, and ſteeming blood made in the right Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Heart is carried into the Lungs, which by reaſon of its purity, is eaſily governed by Nature, and is ſent by the Venal Artery to the left Ventricle of the Heart, and it ſeldom is altered from its Natural condition, which uſeth to make a Peripneumonia. But contrarily, a defluxion from the Head cutting through the large paſſages into the Bronchia of the Lungs, if it there putrifie, will draw blood unto it, and make a Peripneumonia.</p>
                     <p>This Peripneumonia is ſomtimes alone without another diſeaſe, ſomtimes it followeth other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, as Squinzy or Pleuriſie. <hi>Galen</hi> in Com. 11. Sect. 7. Aphor. teacheth that a Peripneumonia doth follow a Pleuriſie two waies: Either when a Pleuriſie is turned into a Peripneumonia, or when an inflamation of the Lungs followeth a Pleuriſie. This tranſmutation is when the former diſeaſe ceaſeth, and the other comes; but it comes upon it when it is white, the former remaineth.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the immediate internal cauſe of a Peripneumonia is blood, often flegmatick, ſeldom chollerick, and moſt ſeldom melanchollick, Which either comes from the whol body being pletho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, or cachochymical, that is, full, or of evil habit; or from ſome part which is replete or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered.</p>
                     <p>The External Cauſes of Peripneumonia and Pleuriſie are the ſame; namely whatſoever defluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can come to thoſe parts: the chief whereof are: Firſt great exerciſe and violent motion of the Body, eſpecially after long reſt, and high feeding. For then the humors abounding from high diet, and kept in by long reſt, by exerciſe are diſperſed, attenuated, and heated, and are after ſent to the weaker parts, moſt fit to receive them, among which the Breaſt and Lungs are chief, becauſe by ſtrong exerciſe, there is cauſed great and often breathing, and ſo they become wearied, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Lungs being ſoft and looſe can eaſily receive the humors coming to them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Among the external Cauſes the cold and Northernly Air is reckoned, when it comes ſuddenly after a Southern and warm; for the pores are opened by warm Air, and the humors are more fluid, which by the cold Air coming after, are compreſſed, and the humors ſent to the weak parts.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, From <hi>Hipp. lib.</hi> of Air, Places, and Waters, the drinking of ſtanding Pools and Lakes, begets the Peripneumonia; for ſaith the Divine old man, we obſerve diſeaſes of the Lungs to be moſt in Marſhy Countries.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="159" facs="tcp:49088:93"/>Alſo the Signs of a Peripnumonia do agree with the ſigns of a Pleuriſie. Two are the ſame, as a ſharp Feaver, and a Cough; which ſomtimes is dry, ſomtimes moiſt, or with more Flegmatick ſpittle coloured with Choller or Blood; and in the progreſs of time, the ſpittle becomes Mattery when the matter of the Diſeaſe grows ripe, and concocted by heat, which ſomtimes comes to paſs when the ſubſtance of the Lungs is not hurt; for if they ulcerate, a Conſumption wil ſollow.</p>
                     <p>So we may obſerve, That in ſore Eyes that are Mattery, the humors are converted into Matter when the ſubſtance of the Eye is neither ſuppurated, nor ulcerated.</p>
                     <p>The other ſigns differ in reſpect of the part affected; the difficulty of Breathing is greater than in a Pleuriſie by reaſon of the narrowneſs of the part inflamed, ſo that the Patient ſeems to be choaked and cannot breath but with the head upright: For the part cannot be compreſſed by reaſon of the extention and repletion, nor be more dilated, although it be much dilated, yet it takes in but little Air, therefore the reſpiration is quick and often, with ſnorting: This is augmented by a Feaver by which the breath is hotter, and the deſire of cold air is greater.</p>
                     <p>The Pulſe is great, faint, and ſoft by reaſon of Flegm and the looſeneſs of the Lungs: yet there is ſome hardneſs by the Choller and blood: it is unequal from the compreſſion of the Artery neer the Heart, and in thick Humors moſt: Somtimes it is intermitting, watery, vermicular, when the Lungs are rotten by too much moiſture.</p>
                     <p>There is a heavy pain that reacheth from the Breaſt to the Back, ſomtimes it is between the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and ſomtimes under one only Shoulder, and from thence communicated to the Throat and Pap: Eſpecially in a Cough, ſomtimes they feel no pain til they begin to Cough: ſomtimes there is alſo a pricking pain in the ſide when it is joyned with a Pleuriſie as it often happeneth: Although the Membrane that covers the Lungs be of the ſame nature with the Pleura, as <hi>Galen</hi> taught 4. <hi>de loc. affect. cap.</hi> 5. Yet there is not ſo great pain in a Peripneumonia as in a Pleuriſie, for two Differences which are laid down by <hi>Galen</hi> in the place afore-cited.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt is, Becauſe the Nerves that go to the Membrane of the Lungs, are few and very little; but they which go to the Pleura, are many and great.</p>

                     <p>But the Lungs are ſoft and yeilding, and therefore their pain is leſs.</p>
                     <p>There is Redneſs in the Cheeks, by reaſon of the hot vapors which fly into the head and carrying with them the thinner blood. And this Colour is moſt in the Cheeks, becauſe their skin is thinneſt.</p>

                     <p>There is a Delirium, or Doting, when it comes from Choller; and a Coma, when it comes from Flegm.</p>
                     <p>If the Diſeaſe comes of Chollerick blood, the ſpittle wil be yellow, the heat and thirſt greater, more difficulty of breathing with leſs Heavineſs; the air breathed forth is more hot: the Feaver is very violent, the Pulſe ſwift, the Delirium great, the Water thin, yellow and cleer, the age, time of the year, the Country, and Diet before, do al atteſt for Choller.</p>

                     <p>Laſtly, If Melancholly blood be the Cauſe, the Spittle wil be black or blewiſh; the Tongue black, from the beginning dry and rough; there wil be alſo heavineſs and great ſighing between brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and al the ſigns of Melancholly predominating in the whol body.</p>

                        <hi>Chap. 4.</hi> Of <hi>Empyema,</hi> or matter in the hollow of the Thorax.</head>
                     <p>ALthough the word <hi>Empyema</hi> ſignifie all Suppuration, yet Cuſtom hath prevailed ſo that it is taken only for a Collection of matter in the Cavity of the Thorax.</p>
                     <p>Now there is a Three-fold Cauſe of the gathering of matter between the Lungs and the Thorax.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is an Inflamation ſuppurated, which happens in a Pleuriſie or Peripneumonia; and when the Impoſthume is broken, the matter falls into the Cavity of the breaſt. The ſame may be in a Squinzy, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> teacheth, Aph. 10. Sect. 5. in theſe words: <hi>Whoſoever is freed from an
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:49088:94"/>
Angina, they have a Diſeaſe in the Lungs, and die within ſeven daies; but if they live longer, it comes to ſuppuration.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſecond is blood falling into the Thorax, where by continuance it muſt needs come to Suppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> Aph. 20. Sect. 6. <hi>If blood be ſent into the Belly beſides Nature, neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is ſuppurated.</hi> But this ſuppuration is not alwaies true, and properly ſo called, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>Hippocrates</hi> teacheth, but rather to be called a corruption, of which there is matter like quittor produced. This Blood may come from a Vein wounded.</p>
                     <p>The third Cauſe is flegm falling from the Head &amp; other parts into the Breaſt, and there putrifying. <hi>So Hippocrates,</hi> Aph. 38. Sect. 7. <hi>The diſtillations into the upper Belly are ſuppurated in twenty dales. Galen</hi> in his Commentaries, by the upper Belly underſtands the Breaſt. But the flegm there putrifying doth not beget a true <hi>Pus,</hi> or matter, but ſomething like it; as we obſerve in flegmatick Tumors, as Atheroma, Steatoma, Meliceris, which are kinds of Impoſthumes.</p>
                     <p>The Diagnoſtick ſigns are of two ſorts: Some declare the diſeaſe to be in the beginning; others that it's old, and confirmed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hippocrates</hi> layeth down Three ſigns of this Suppuration, beginning 2. Progn.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is when the Feaver groweth ſtronger, becauſe the Pleuriſie, or Peripneumonia is not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, for while the matter is turning into <hi>Pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        </hi> the feaver is encreaſed, <hi>Hipp.</hi> Aph. 47. Sect. 1.</p>
                     <p>The Second is a quaking, which comes when the ſharpneſs of the matter doth twitch the Membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous parts.</p>
                     <p>The Third is weight, and ſence of heavineſs in the part; for the humor being contained in the Gavity doth weigh heavier than when it is diffuſed. <hi>Galen</hi> addeth in 4. <hi>de loc. aſf. cap. 9.</hi> fluctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or routing: <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if any one is forced to turn in his bed, and perceive ſomething to ſlow down at that time, it is no doubt but that there is much matter contained there.</hi> And you may often hear the fluctuation, unleſs the thickneſs or plenty of the matter, which fills the whol Cavity of the Thorax, do hinder the ſluctuation. To theſe you may ad diſſiculty of Breathing. For although after the Impoſthume is broken, the pain of the ſide ceaſeth, and the Diaphragma and Muſcles of the Thorax move more freely; yet becauſe the Lungs are oppreſſed with matter round about them, ſo that they cannot move freely, and ſome part of the matter is ſucked into the ſubſtance of the Lungs, from whence it is that the Lungs are ſo heavy, and the Bronchia is obſtructed, thence is ſhort brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. For the purulent ſpittle comes from the filth ſent into the Lungs and Bronchia, which ſhews an Empyema; but this is not alwaies a ſpitting of matter by reaſon of its thickneſs, which keeps it from coming to the Bronchia.</p>
                     <p>But a long lingering Feaver, partly putrid, partly Hectical, milder in the day, and ſharper at night, much ſweat, eſpecially at night, a conſtant troubleſom Cough, ſignifie that the Diſeaſe is old and confirmed; as alſo when the Cheeks grow red, and the Eyes hollow, the Nails crooked, the Legs ſwel, and Puſtuls break forth of the Breaſt by reaſon that the ſharpeſt part of the matter breaks out of the Skin; theſe ſignifie the Diſeaſe confirmed.</p>
                     <p>You may know which ſide is affected from <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> 2. Progn. text. 21: <hi>If</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>an Empyema be only in one part, you muſt turn the Patient, and learn whether he be pamed, or hotter in one ſide than the other, and to ask him if he perceives any burden to hang on the ſide that is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and if it be ſo, in which ſide ſoever the weight is, the ſuppuration is on the other; as if heat and weight be in both ſides, the Pus is contained in the whol Cavity of the Breaſt.</hi> Alſo <hi>Avicen</hi> adds a Conjecture which he took from <hi>Hipp. 3. de morb. Apply</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a linnen cloth wet to both ſides, and that will be dry ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>oneſt which lieth upon the part where the matter is contained.</hi> We may lay down another ſign from our own Experience, which was not obſerved by Authers, namely, In the ſide affected there will he an Oedematory Tumor, from a Potion of the thinneſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter breathing through the Muſeles of the Thorax. And when, in ſuſpition thereof there appears ſuch a Tumor, and blowing up of the skin on either ſide, you may certainly pronounce that the Empyema is there, and you may ſafely open the ſide.</p>
                     <p>The chief Prognoſtick Signs are given by <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> 2. Progn. Text. 63. in theſe words: <hi>In Suppurations they chieſly eſcape, whom the feaver left the ſame day they broke; and they who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently deſire meat; and are freed from thirſt, and have ſmel, and laudible excrements: and if the Pus be white and even, and of the ſame color, and when it is voided without pain or great Cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But they die whom the feaver leaveth not, or to whom ſeeming to leave them it returns again, and who are thirſty and have no appetite, have a looſe Belly, the Pus green, and livid, or ſrothy. They die who have all theſe ſigns: But they who have but ſome of them, ſome die, and ſome lie long ſick.</hi>

                     <p>Therefore it is better to attempt this Evacuation with Medicines that expel Water, for which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe al thoſe Medicines preſcribed by us in the Cure of the Dropſie, are good. Where we muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve diligently, That if when the Diſeaſe is confirmed, and much ſerous humor is gathered in the Breaſt, you give a violent Purge, thoſe humors wil be much moved, from whence there wil come a great Suffocation which wil kil the Patient: therefore be wary, and give your Medicine in a leſs Doſe, though oftener, and mix them with ſtrong Openers that purge Urin, that both the paſſages may be unſtopt, and the Matter carried to the Uritories.</p>
                     <p>Among Water Purges the Minerals are beſt, as Mercurius Dulcis, and Mercurius Vitae ſo corrected that it may work only downward.</p>
                     <p>Alſo Diureticks alone, or Medicines to provoke Urin often uſed are good, becauſe they turn away the matter coming to the breaſt, to the bladder, and by way of Conſequence they bring it alſo from the breaſt.</p>
                     <p>Alſo Sudorificks are profitable, to the carrying away of this ſerous matter; and we ſaw a man of ſixty years old, who by the uſe of a Sweating drink made of Guaiacum and Sarſa taken fifteen days together, and by provoking ſweat with the vapor of the Spirit of Wine, was Cured.</p>
                     <p>Cauteries applied to make Iſſues in the Thighes and Legs, are alſo good to take Water from the breaſt.</p>
                     <p>You may hinder the breeding of this Water, by amending the faults of thoſe parts which ſend this Matter.</p>
                     <p>So if the Lungs be in fault you muſt apply proper Medicines unto them: if the Liver or Spleen be troubled with Diſtemper, Obſtruction, Schirrus, or the like, you muſt cure them by Medicines ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of their ſeveral Chapters.</p>
                     <p>But thoſe things which do ſtrengthen the Vital and the Natural parts wil alwayes agree, ſuch as are preſcribed in the Cure of Weakneſs, Dropſie and Flux of the Liver.</p>

                     <p>The ſame blood offending in quality, as when it is too hot or too thin, it wil come forth by way of <hi>Anaſtomoſis;</hi> but becauſe heat wil open the Orifices, and the thinneſs cauſeth it to flow more eaſily: Alſo the ſame qualities make a <hi>Diapedeſis</hi> or Rarifaction: for heat doth make thin the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles of the Veſſels, and the thinneſs of the blood cauſeth it to flow more eaſily through the pores of thoſe Tunicles.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, The ſharpneſs of the blood doth gnaw the Tunicles of the Veins and exulcerate them, &amp; ſo cauſe a <hi>Diabroſis,</hi> or Eroſion; this alſo is cauſed by ſharp or ſalt humors which diſtil from the head, or coming from other parts to the Lungs.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, The External Cauſes do concur for the production of this Diſeaſe either mediately or immediately: It is produced immediately by a ſtroak, fal, wound, or the like; but they produce it mediately which encreaſe blood, heat and attenuate; as high and hot feeding, ſtoppage of Terms or Haemorrhoids, too much exerciſe, great clamor, heat, long ſtaying in the ſun, and many others.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, External Cold may cauſe the Ruption of the Veſſels, by making their Tunicles harder and not ſo eaſily to be extended; but with this muſt be joyned ſtrong Motion, or abundance of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors.</p>
                     <p>The Diagnoſis of this Diſeaſe is difficult in reſpect of the part from whence it comes: yet <hi>Galen</hi>
                        <pb n="165" facs="tcp:49088:97"/>
declareth it in few words; 4. <hi>de loc. affect. cap.</hi> 6. namely, blood coming from the Gullet and Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach is put forth by vomit; when it comes from the Vital parts, by Cough: from the Jaws and Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zand, by Hawking: from the Mouth by ſimple ſpetting, which wants a more cleer explication when blood comes from the head to the inner parts of the Weazand and the Jaws, it comes forth by Cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſo it doth when it comes from the breaſt; and therefore it is not diſtinguiſhed by this ſign.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, When blood coming from the Lungs or Breaſt is brought out by Coughing: There are other neceſſary ſigns from which the parts affected may be diſtinguiſhed.</p>
                     <p>Firſt therefore when blood comes from the head, although it ſomtimes cauſe Coughing; yet the greateſt part thereof is put forth by Hawking, and there is a tickling in the Pallat as in a Catarrh: as alſo when you look into the Pallat it appeareth to be foul, and bloody; and it is more confirmed to be from the Head if at that time the Noſe bleed.</p>
                     <p>When the blood comes from the Lungs, it is diſtinguiſhed from that which comes from the Breaſt by <hi>Galen</hi> in the place mentioned; for that which comes from the Lungs is froathy, in greater plenty, and without pain: but from the Breaſt, it is black, little, and with pain.</p>
                     <p>But it may be objected, That blood coming from the breaſt is carried by the Lungs, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is froathy, becauſe it is mixed with the air taken in, as that which comes immediately from the Lungs.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>Avicen</hi> ſaith, That blood from the breaſt is froathy: I Anſwer, That it is one thing to ſpet ſome froath mixed with the blood; and another thing to ſpet nothing but froath, which only comes from the ſubſtance of the Lungs.</p>
                     <p>Therefore you may obſerve<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Three degrees of froath: for it is either wholly froathy from the fleſh of the Lungs, which it reſembleth, for the Lungs are but a congealed froath; or it comes from the Veſſels of the Lungs and is very froathy: or it is mixed with froath and comes from the breaſt.</p>
                     <p>But the moſt certain ſign that it comes from the Lungs is taken from the pain, which is fixed and continueth where the ſolution of continuity is.</p>
                     <p>And you muſt obſerve, That blood is ſomtimes ſent from the Liver, Spleen, Matrix, and other parts into the Lungs and ſpet forth: ſo that the Breaſt is not primarily, but ſecondarily affected; which thing is hardly to be diſcovered.</p>
                     <p>But we may conjecture of it, namely if any of the aforeſaid parts be troubled with pain, inflama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or any other diſtemper, and there neither is, nor hath been, any other fault in the breaſt.</p>
                     <p>You may find out the ſigns of the Cauſes from what hath been ſaid: For if blood be brought by the Anaſtomoſis of the Veins, there went before ſome Cauſe that opened the mouth of the Veſſels, then blood is thrown forth in a pretty quantity and without pain. But if it come forth by Diapede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis or Rarefaction, then is it wateriſh, little, and without pain.</p>
                     <p>When it breaks forth by Rixis, or Eruption, it is very much; if a Repletion went before, or any External Cauſe that might break the Veſſels.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, If it comes by Diabroſis, or Corroſion of the Vein, there went before ſalt and ſharp di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffillations from the head: The blood is ſalt, and ſharp, and ill coloured; and ſome Cauſes of ſharp humors were formerly: in the beginning there is but little blood, but after when the Corroſion is greater, then is much blood ſpet forth, and at laſt there is a ſpetting of Matter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> Aphor. 25. Sect. 4. doth lay down the Prognoſtick of this Diſeaſe, as what kind of blood ſoever is ſpet out of the mouth from any part below, it is evil: for every opening of a veſſel which letteth blood come forth ſo, is dangerous; eſpecially in the Lungs; concerning which his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoriſm chiefly ſpeaks.</p>
                     <p>But ſomtimes ſuch ſpetting of blood may be without hurt; namely, When Nature by a critical Motion doth purge the ſuperfluous blood by thoſe waies. And it is obſerved, That Women which have had their Terms ſtopt have without harm at certain times ſpet blood from their Lungs by the Anaſtomoſis of the veins.</p>
                     <p>In reſpect of the Cauſes. Diapedeſis or Rarifaction is leſs dangerous than Anaſtomoſis or Aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Eruption is moſt dangerous; for unleſs it be healed within three or four dayes there cometh an inflamation, which being ſuppurated produceth an Ulcer, from whence cometh a Conſumption: Whence <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith, Aphor. 15, &amp; 16. Sect. 7. That from ſpetting of blood there followeth ſpetting of Matter, and from ſpetting of Matter a Phthiſis or Conſumption.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Diabroſis</hi> or Corroſion is moſt dangerous; and <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, That it is incurable by reaſon the Ulcer that followeth it is incurable.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of <hi>Haemoptoe</hi> or ſpetting blood, is wrought by Revulſion of blood from the Lungs by correcting the evil quality thereof, and cloſing the vein that is opened, by aſtringing and conglutina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting means.</p>
                     <p>Firſt therefore let blood from the Arm on the ſame ſide on which you find heavineſs or pricking, in a ſmal quantity often, and at a diſtance for the better Revulſion.</p>
                     <p>After that, open the vein in the Foot, and ſo you wil make a Revulſion to a further diſtance, and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:49088:98"/>
this will be more profitable if the diſeaſe come from obſtruction of the Terms. If the Patient be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Hemorrhoids, you muſt open them with Horſ-leeches.</p>
                     <p>Alſo apply Cupping-glaſſes with Scarrification to the ſhoulders and back, or without Scarrifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Groins and under the Ribs. Rub and bind the extream parts, and in all the time of the Cure, at ſome diſtance apply often thoſe Cupping-glaſſes to the Hypochondria, or under the Ribs.</p>
                     <p>And let him take the following Julep thrice every day.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Plantane and Poppy Water, of each two ounces: Syrup of dried Roſes one ounce: Lapis Prunellae one dram: Mix them for a Julep.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, You muſt often purge the ſerous and Chollerick humors which make the blood more thin and fluid with Medicines that have an aſtringent Vertue: As,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Rhubarb one dram: yellow Myrobolans half a dram: Tamarinds half an ounce: Infuſe them in Plantane Water; ſtrain it and diſſolve in it Pouder of Rhubarb half a dram: Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of dried Roſes one ounce. Make a Potion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then give Medicines that cloſe the Orifices of the Veſſels by an aſtringent quality, but ſuch as will not retain the blood in the Breaſt by too much aſtriction; therefore mix ſomtimes with them ſuch as diſſolve and expectorate the congealed blood which is out of the Veſſels.</p>
                     <p>Of all which theſe following are the beſt:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Bole-Armenick, Terra Sigillata, both ſorts of Coral, Blood-ſtone, of each half a dram: Sugar of Roſes half an ounce. With one white of an Egg well beaten with Roſe Water, make a Lohoch.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or you may make one more ſpeedily, and more pleaſant thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Water of the white of an Egg well beaten two drams: Sugar of Roſes one ounce: white Starch three drams. Mix them for a Lohoch.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Conſerve of Roſes, and the greater Comfry, of each one ounce: Bole-Armenick and Terra Sigillata, of each one dram: With the Syrup of dried Roſes make an Opiate to be often held in the mouth, and ſwallowed by degrees.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Conſerve of dried Roſes, Troches of Amber, and of ſealed Earth, of each half a dram: prepared Pearls one ſcruple: Sugar of Roſes as much as of all the reſt. Mix them and let him take a ſpoonful thereof one hour before meat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Juyce of Purſlain twelve ounces: Sugar eight ounces: Boyl them to a Syrup, of which let him often lick.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is the beſt for ſpitting of blood. And if you want Purſlain, you may take Plantane.</p>
                     <p>The Syrup of Comfry according to <hi>Fernelius,</hi> preſcribed by <hi>Bauderon,</hi> is good for the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Yarrow with the white Flower: and yellow Flower, of each two handfuls: Green Roots of Tormentil, with the Leaves if they may be had, otherwiſe of the dry, one ounce: the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Burnet one handful: Conſerve of red Roſes half a pound: spring Water ſixteen pints: put them in a glaſſed pot covered and luted, that the vapors may not come forth: then boyl them in</hi> Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo Mariae <hi>ſixteen hours; keep the ſtraining in a glaſs, and take ſix ounces thereof every morning, noon, and night.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Troches of Amber one dram: Plantane and Roſe Water, of each one ounce and an half: Syrup of Mirtles and dried Roſes, of each half an ounce. Mix them for a Julep.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Spirit of Vitriol half a ſcruple: Plantane Water four ounces. Mix them for a Potion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This preſently ſtops blood coming either by Cough or Vomiting.</p>
                     <p>Two ſpoonfuls of Syrup of Coral taken every day, is good againſt all manner of bleeding. But the Tincture of Coral drawn with Juyce of Lemmons, is more powerful.</p>

                        <hi>Quercetan</hi> in his Diſpenſatory, preſcribeth this following Water againſt ſpitting of blood, which is very excellent.</p>

                     <p>For this Extenuation of body comes from a putrid lingring Feaver, which turneth to an Hectick; and this Feaver comes from the Ulcer in the Lungs, from which by reaſon of their neerneſs to the Heart putrid Vapors are continually ſent thither and cauſe the Feaver, which after is diſperſed from the Heart into the whol body; ſo al the parts being too cold and dry, and receiving the intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate putrifying heat, do not wel concoct their nouriſhment, but are ill nouriſhed, from whence you may plainly perceive a Conſumption of the ſubſtance of the whol body: for that Feaver by reaſon of its continuance from the perſeverance of the Cauſe turneth Hectick: and its often joyned with a putrid Feaver, which is known by the Urine, and by the Diſtempers extraordinary at ſometimes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <p>A ſharp and Corroding Humor, either coming from other Parts, or breeding in the Lungs, is the immediate Cauſe of an Ulcer in the Lungs.</p>
                     <p>Firſt ſharp and ſalt Rhewm falls from the brain, which being violent eaſily ulcerateth the Lungs: Somtimes Flegm that is not ſharp nor ſalt wil do the ſame: namely, if it lie long in them and putrifie, and from the putrifaction ariſeth an Acrimony, which Corroding Ulcerateth: yet this putrid flegm in the Lungs doth not alwayes ulcerate, as we may obſerve in a Catarrh when putrid Matter is ſpet forth, and the Lungs are ſound.</p>
                     <p>But there are two Conditions for the Cauſing of an Ulcer: one in reſpect of the matter flowing; another in reſpect of the Lungs: In reſpect of the Matter it is required that it ſhould be ſo diſpoſed, that when it is putrified it begets a ſharpneſs which may cauſe an Ulcer: In reſpect of the Lungs, they muſt be extraordinary tender, and diſpoſed to corruption, which in a word is called a Vitious Conſtitution of the Lungs, coming from the Parents uſually, of which we will ſpeak here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                     <p>Now the Humors that Exulcerate and putrifie the Lungs, come from the parts adjoyning, as the Pleura, Mediaſtinum, Diaphragma, rough Artery, and eſpecially from an inflamation in them, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

                     </p>
                     <p>The Humor is in the Lungs when from ſome veſſel broken, corroded, or opened by a wound, the blood flowing doth putrifie; or when an Ulcer is left there from the ſmal pox.</p>
                     <p>Somtimes from the evil Conſtitution of the Lungs, evil Humors proceed; which corrupt their ſubſtance and cauſe a Conſumption: and this comes commonly from the Parents, from whence a Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>mption is reckoned among the Haereditary diſeaſes, of which it is the chief, ſo that we may obſerve how many whol Families are taken away with this diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>This evil Conſtitution of the Lungs is not in the firſt qualities, but hath ſome malignant and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous quality, by which it becomes infectious: Although we deny not but a ſoft and looſe ſubſtance of the Lungs, and therefore more fit for Corruption, doth much conduce to the breeding of this Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>This evil Conſtitution of the Lungs cauſeth that ſome fal into Conſumptions without a Diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Inflamation, or any other evident Cauſe, but only from the fault of the part that corrupteth its own nouriſhment.</p>
                     <p>Somtimes it comes from a Puſtulae bred in the Lungs and broken, which by <hi>Hippocrates, 1. de morbis,</hi> is made two-fold:</p>
                     <p>One by him is called, A Crude Puſtule, becauſe it never comes to Suppuration, but growing by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees ſtops the paſſage of the breath, and at length kils the Patient.</p>
                     <p>The other is that which cometh to Suppuration, and is called the Impoſthume of the Lungs, and theſe come two wayes, either by Defluxion, or Congeſtion; and the Matter gathered is either in a Bagg or without it in the very ſubſtance of the part.</p>
                     <p>The thickneſs of the Bagg often cauſeth that ſuch an Impoſthume is carried many yeers in the Lungs undiſcovered, and without any hurt to the body: From whence <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith, Aph. 41. Sect. 6. <hi>They who have an Impoſthume in the body, and feel it not, it is by reaſon of the thickneſs of the Matter, or of the place wherein it is that they feel it not:</hi> For this Cauſe many who ſeemed to be in perfect health have ſuddenly died by an Impoſthume broken within: of which there are Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples in <hi>Ferne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="170" facs="tcp:49088:101"/>If the matter which comes from the Impoſthume broken, flow into the Ventricle of the Heart, the ſick preſently die: but if it come to the Bronchia, or paſſages in the Lungs, it may be ſpit up; if the body be ſtrong, and the matter little in quantity; but commonly there is an ulcer remaining in the Lungs which cauſeth a Conſumption.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, There are external Cauſes, as contagion, which is the chiefeſt; for this Diſeaſe is ſo infectious, that we may obſerve Women to be infected by their Husbands, and Men by their Wives, and all their Children to die of the ſame; not only from the infection of their Parents ſeed, but from the company of him that was firſt affected.</p>
                     <p>And this Contagion is more eaſily communicated to them that are of kin, wherefore it is not ſafe for a Brother or Siſter to enter into the Chamber for the <hi>Miaſmaza,</hi> or vapors infective, which come from their Lungs, and infect the whol Air of the Chamber, and being drawn in by others (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if they are any way diſpoſed to the ſame Diſeaſe) beget the ſame diſeaſe in their Lungs.</p>
                     <p>There are other external Cauſes, eſpecially very hot or cold Air; the hot Air doth melt down the ſharp humors which are contained in the Brain, and ſends them to the Lungs. The too cold Air by aſtringing, compreſſing, and Squeezing doth cauſe the like defluxion: But the Air in Autumn is moſt dangerous, becauſe by its inequality in heat and cold, it cauſeth ſharp and ſalt diſtillations; whence <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith, Aph. 10. Sect, 3. <hi>Autumn is the worſt time for People in Conſumptions.</hi> Secondly, Sharp and ſalt meats and drinks do cauſe a Conſumption, which ſill the Head with ſalt and ſharp vapors. And laſtly, all thoſe internal and external Cauſes which uſe to produce ſpitting of blood, which uſeth to end in a Conſumption, may be ſaid to be Cauſes thereof.</p>
                     <p>Among the Antecedent Cauſes, evil humors throughout the whol body, are accounted the chief, which being moved by external cauſes, are ſent to the brain, and from thence to the Lungs. Among which you may reckon the ſuppreſſion of the Terms, Hemorrhoids, or other uſual evacuations, which doth cauſe Catarrhs and defluxions.</p>
                     <p>The aforeſaid Cauſes do produce this Diſeaſe, eſpecially among thoſe whom <hi>Hippocrates</hi> calleth <hi>Phthirodeis,</hi> and <hi>Pterugodeis,</hi> that is, ſuch as have a ſtraight and diſtreſſed breaſt, a long neck, and ſhoulder bones ſticking forth, who muſt of neceſſity fall into this diſeaſe, if they have tender Lungs, or any hereditary inclination thereunto. Alſo they are inclined to a Conſumption, who have a weak Head, which is eaſily filled winh ſuperfluous Humors, which are ſent to the Organs or Inſtruments of the Spirits.</p>
                     <p>There are no true and proper Differences of Conſumptions, but ſuch as come from the variety of their Cauſes. Yet <hi>Hippocrates</hi> doth lay down many kinds which are worth the obſerving, which muſt be reduced, not to a true Conſumption, but to one in general, which is without ulcer of the Lungs. And firſt <hi>lib. 6. epid. ſect. 8. text.</hi> 47. he ſheweth of a Conſumption which came from a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Reins, in this Hiſtory: <hi>A Satyre called</hi> Grypalopex, <hi>being twenty five yeers old, had Nocturnal Polutions, and dayly loſs of Seed; who when he came to be thirty yeers of age, fell into a Conſumption, and died.</hi> For by the continual loſs of Seed the nouriſhment of the body is taken away, by which the ſolid patts are conſumed and dried.</p>
                     <p>There is another kind in <hi>Hipp. 2. de morb.</hi> called the Conſumption of the back, which comes from too much Lechery, which deſtroyeth the whol habit of the Body, and takes away the nouriſhment from the ſolid parts: this happens to new married folks, who are unſatiable, and is the chiefeſt of the Conſumptions of the back; for <hi>Hippocrates</hi> laies down four kinds thereof: The firſt is that men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, which comes from Lechery. The ſecond is laid down <hi>lib. 2. de intern. affect. text.</hi> 13. which comes from too much blood, and nouriſhment going to the Spinal Marrow, by which the Natural heat, and all other faculties are ſtifled and deſtroyed. Now <hi>Hipp. 5. epid.</hi> ſheweth that the body may conſume by too much blood, in a ſtory concerning one, who, when nothing would nouriſh him, but he ſtill grew leaner, was perfectly cured, when all other Medicines failed, by bleeding in both Hands as long as the Veins would diſcharge. The third kind is in the place mentioned, namely, when the marrow of the back is dried, by which the whol body drieth and conſumeth. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> mentioneth two Cauſes of this drineſs: one is the obſtruction of the veins which go to the back with nouriſhment; another is the flowing of Choller from the head upon the back, which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſheweth in his Book <hi>de locis in homine.</hi> The fourth is deſcribed in the ſame Book, and it comes from a diſtillation upon the marrow of the back, in theſe words: <hi>Moreover, when a defluxion falls upon the Back, this kind of conſumption cometh with pain in the Loyns, and ſeeming emptineſs to the Patient in the internal parts of the head.</hi> In the ſame Book, numb. 18. he ſaith thus: <hi>When there is a defluxion upon the Marrow, there is a ſecret undiſcernable Conſumption.</hi> He calls it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, becauſe when the body decaies, you cannot ſo eaſily find out the cauſe: he calls it undiſcerna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe you cannot perceive the inconveniences of the defluxion at the firſt. But it ceaſeth to be ſecret and undiſcernable, if the defluxion be not only upon the marrow of the back, but alſo upon the <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> and Hip: for then the diſtillation is apparent, and there is pain and loſs of motion, with dejection of mind. Theſe are more cleer in <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> in his Tenth Book <hi>de glandulis,</hi> in
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:49088:101"/>
theſe words: <hi>There is another Diſeaſe which comes from a defluxion from the Head by the Veins upon the Marrow of the Back, and from thence to the</hi> Os Sacrum, <hi>and Hip, which is a Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo which deſtroyeth, for then the Shoulders and both the feet are weak, and after the leggs, and they alwaies die of it, though they have been formerly cured.</hi> This kind of Conſumption is to be obſerved, becauſe it often happeneth, eſpecially to ſuch who have weak Nerves, which will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily receive the deſluxion.</p>
                     <p>To this kind you may refer that which comes of want and hunger; which <hi>Galen</hi> mentioneth, <hi>lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de Maraſmo,</hi> when the Body decaies for want of nouriſhment. Now Nouriſhment is wanting to the ſolid parts, not only for want or meat, which the Stomach concocteth, and ſends to the Liver to make blood for the whol Body: but alſo when the <hi>Chylus</hi> which is ſufficiently concocted in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach cannot paſs through the Meſeraick Veins, by reaſon of their obſtruction; as it happeneth to them who have a Struma, whoſe Meſentery for the moſt part is full of Glandles; by which the milky Veins called <hi>Venae Lacteae,</hi> are compreſſed, from whence the whol Body grows lean, and they die of a Conſumption.</p>
                     <p>But the ſolid parts are deprived of their neceſſary nouriſhment when ſalt blood that is not ſit for nouriſhment is gathered into the Veins, which, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſhews, are incurable, 5. Meth. except by <hi>Epicraſis,</hi> or change of habit. And finally, <hi>Galen, lib. de Maraſmo, decimo meth.</hi> and in other places, ſpeaks of a Conſumption from a manifeſt or hidden Inflamation, from the ſyncope of the Heart or Stomach, and the like, which may be ſeen in their proper places.</p>
                     <p>The Diagnoſtick ſigns by which you may know a true Conſumption, do ſome of them, declare a Conſumption beginning, or begun, or confirmed, which are very well ſet down by <hi>Hipp. 1. de morbis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſigns of a Conſumption at hand, are in <hi>Hipp.</hi> Book, mentioned, Text 9. in theſe words: <hi>There is alſo a Suppuration when flegm flows from the Head upon the Lungs; and firſt for the moſt part it flows privately, and cauſeth a little Cough, and the ſpittle to be bitter, and a little heat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this ſaying there are contained four ſigns of an eminent Conſumption.</p>
                     <p>The firſt ſign is, A defluxion from the beginning cloſely conveighed to the Lungs, becauſe then the matter is little, and becauſe the thinner part of the humor, which floweth about the rough Artery, and doth not vex the Lungs, which otherwiſe would be more diſturbed in the beginning, before they are weakened; thence it is called a ſecret defluxion, becauſe there is little hurt at the firſt done thereby.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond ſign is, When the Humor flowing makes but a ſmal Cough, being at the firſt but little and thin.</p>
                     <p>The third ſign is, When the ſpittle is more bitter than uſually it was, becauſe the humor that muſt ulcerate the Lungs muſt be ſweet, ſharp, or ſalt; which qualities being altered by a preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral heat, do turn bitter: for it is known that ſweet and ſalt things overmuch boyled, do grow bitter. But in regard that preternatural heat is not very great at the firſt, the ſpittle is but a little bitter.</p>
                     <p>The fourth ſign, is a little heat, as being feaveriſh; for when the matter is not much moved, but receiveth putrifaction from the heat of the place, wherein it hath been long contained, the Feaver cannot be very violent, for the putrid matter can many waies be refrigerated; therfore it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if the Feaver be ſmal in the beginning.</p>
                     <p>To theſe ſigns of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> we may ad an evil formation of the Breaſt and Youth, which mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the aforeſaid ſigns, muſt needs declare a conſumption to be at hand.</p>
                     <p>The evil faſhion of the Breaſt is when it is narrow, and the Shoulder-blades ſtick up like wings, when the fore part of the Breaſt is narrow, and the hinder part broad, for then the Breaſt is both ſmal and evil proportioned. The ſtraightneſs of the Breaſt ſhews want of Natural heat, and the evil pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion ſhews its weakneſs. For if the Natural heat were much and vigorous, the breaſt would have thereby been extended. But ſuch and ſo great is this diſpoſition, that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> calls it a Natural Conſumption, coming from a principle in Nature. Wherefore they who are thus made muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity fall into a Conſumption, except ſome other diſeaſe take them off. Which by the way is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, for if they have any acute diſeaſe, who are thus inclined, they ſeldom eſcape, becauſe the Natural heat is weak and little, and therefore will eaſily be overcome by a ſtrong diſeaſe. Therefore the moſt wary Phyſitians in ſuch kind of Natures and habits, do uſe to prognoſtick rather death and danger, than health or recovery, when they fall into any diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>In them who are inclinable to this Diſeaſe, Youth is moſt dangerous, according to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> Aph. 9. Sect. 5. eſpecially from Eighteen to Thirty Five yeers, in which time there is much blood for to break the veſſels; as alſo it is then thin and ſharp, more proper to open and corrode the Veſſels: In Children, the Catarrh is made ſlow with much Moiſture: in Old Men, it is allayed with Cold: but in the Middle Age, for the Reaſons aforeſaid, it doth often exulcerate.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, in Youth many diſtempers come by Diet, by which many ill humors are produced and the blood infected<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> as alſo by reaſon of violent exerciſe, as running, wreſtling, leaping, fencing, going in the ſun, a vein may be broken in the Lungs which may produce a Conſumption.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="172" facs="tcp:49088:102"/>The ſigns of a Conſumption begun, are ſet down by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his Book of Diſeaſes before mentioned, <hi>Text</hi> 10. in theſe words, <hi>In progreſs of time the Lungs are exasperated and ulcerated within by the Catarrh putrifying there, whereby the breaſt ſeems ponderous, and there is a pain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and behind; and there is more ſharp heat in the body: and the Lungs by reaſon of their heat draw moiſture from the whol body and eſpecially from the head, which alſo is made hot from that body, and ſpetteth forth thick matter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In theſe Words there are <hi>Six Signs</hi> contained of a Conſumption begun.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Firſt ſign is,</hi> That the Lungs are exaſparated in progreſs of time: that is, The Cough is more violent; for the Diſeaſe increaſing the Diſtillation is ſtronger, and the Lungs are peirced therewith, and provoked to Cough forth that which hurteth them: which Cough doth not only come from the matter flowing down, but from that which flowed formerly: for being not Coughed up it grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth foul by long continuance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by which means the Lungs are more forced to expulſion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Second ſign is,</hi> The weight of the Breaſt which comes from the matter gathered into the Lungs: For albeit the Lungs of themſelves do feel little or nothing, yet becauſe they are tyed to the Breaſt by Membranes, they perceive a weight, when they are burdened.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A Third ſign is,</hi> A ſharp pain before, and behind: for the matter contained in the Lungs doth with its evil quality offend them, as wel as with its quantity and putrifaction, by which the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes are pricked, which cauſe great pain: for the pain in the Membranes is alwayes pricking. Now this pain is perceived before and behind; becauſe theſe Membranes are joyned before to the Sternon, and behind to the Back: and the cauſe of this pain is from a great Cough, called by <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> A Malignant, or Cruel Cough.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Fourth ſign is</hi> When ſharp Heat falls into the body, and there followeth a violent Feaver: for when through progreſs of time the matter putrifieth more, it is probable that the Feaver wil be greater; for although the matter from the beginning do only putrifie in the Lungs, yet by reaſon of the Suppuration made in the Breaſt with an Ulcer, the filth is communicated to the humors contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Veins; from which come divers ſorts or putrid Feavers, and theſe differ from that Feaver which comes only from the Ulcer in the Lungs, through the filthy vapors which are carried from them into the Heart, which turns to an Hectick; and therefore in a Conſumption there is a Hectick Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver often joyned with a Putrid.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Fifth ſign is,</hi> When a great quantity of Flegm falls from the Head to the Lungs: which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> confirms, when he ſhews the Cauſe of that great Defluxion; namely, The Lungs by their Heat drawing Flegm from the whol body: Hence it is that the humors contained in the whol body are the matter of a continual and great Flux which doth ſo trouble men in Conſumptions. The Lungs by the filth which they have contracted, grow hot; by which heat Flegm is drawn from the Brain, which the Brain fetcheth from the whol Body: And this is one of the principal Cauſes of the extenuation or the whol body: for al the humors, good and bad, are carried to thoſe parts, and ſo the whol body decayeth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Sixth ſign is,</hi> Spetting of thick rotten Flegm: for when the Matter putrifieth and there is an Ulcer, quittor or filth muſt needs come from thence, and therefore the Spittle is Mattery: but it is between thick and thin: for after that it hath by long continuance in the Lungs grown thick, it is made thinner by the addition of that which breaks from the Ulcer, and ſo it becomes moderate, which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> calls Subcraſſum, or Thickiſh.</p>
                     <p>To theſe mentioned Signs of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> you may ad this as moſt certain, namely, The Extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the body with a lingering and conſtant Feaver: For beſides the putrid Feavers above mentioned which come and go by fits, and grow from the humors which putrifie in the Veins: there is alſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes preſent a lingering daily Feaver coming from the vapors ſent from the Ulcer to the Heart which corrupteth the nouriſhment of the whol body, and makes it dry and hot, from whence the body muſt needs grow extenuated.</p>
                     <p>To there you may ad Sweatings at Night, with which men in Conſumptions are often troubled as ſoon as they begin to ſleep: for by ſleep the Heat is drawn in which encreaſeth the Inflamation of the Lungs; and the heat inwardly increaſed, cauſeth abundance of vapors, which are thickned in the skin, and turned into ſweat.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, There is a continual rigor which comes from the ſharpneſs of the matter which pricketh the Membranes.</p>
                     <p>And Laſtly, You may ad ſweetneſs of ſpittle, which uſeth to come when it begins to Suppurate, which is the original of Saltneſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſhews alſo the ſigns of a Conſumption confirmed, in his 11. Text of the Book above mentioned in theſe words, <hi>The longer this Diſeaſe laſteth, the more abſolute matter will be spet, and the Feavers be the ſharper, the Cough more frequent and ſtrong. the body will more conſume, and yet the body is diſturbed downward from Flegm, and this comes from the Brain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when any man comes to this he muſt periſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="173" facs="tcp:49088:102"/>In theſe Words we may obſerve that there are Five Signs of a Conſumption confirmed.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt is, The Spittle being more Mattery, or rather Matter it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>The Second is, A ſtrong Feaver, and ſharp, more putrifying; and the Ulcer more foul.</p>
                     <p>The Third is, An often and violent Cough more than formerly; often becauſe of the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation and little evacuation, therefore nature laboreth to do that at divers times which the cannot do at once: and it is a ſtronger Cough, not only becauſe the greater ſharpneſs of the Water doth more violently ſtir up the expulſive faculty; but alſo becauſe of the wearing away of the ſolid parts, the breaſt is made more hollow, hence comes a hoarſ and ſounding Cough, as from a hollow place.</p>
                     <p>The Fourth ſign is, Pining and want of Apetite, which makes them leaner; now the want of Appetite comes from the diſtillation which doth not only fal upon the ſpirital members, but alſo upon the natural<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eſpecially the Stomach, whoſe mouth is thence weakened to the loſs of Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite; as alſo from the putrid vapors ſent thither either from the Feaver or the Ulcer.</p>
                     <p>The Laſt ſign is, A looſe belly which comes from Flegm falling from the head, by which in time the ſtomach and guts are weakened, and the retentive faculty deſtroyed: and this kills the Patient as we ſhal ſhew more at large in the Prognoſticks.</p>
                     <p>To theſe ſigns of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> we may ad ſome other:</p>
                     <p>The Firſt is, A great Extenuation of the whol body, ſo that al the Muſculous fleſh is conſumed, and the bones appear only covered with skin: and hence it is that the nayls are crooked, becauſe the Fleſh which was in the tops of the Fingers to hold up the nayls, is conſumed.</p>
                     <p>To this you may ad Difficulty of breathing, both becauſe the Faculty is weak, as alſo becauſe the Bronchia of the Lungs are ſtopt with putrid matter; as alſo becauſe the part is for the moſt part pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified and conſumed, and therefore cannot take in ſufficient air to cool the heart; ſo that what the Lungs cannot do by one breathing, it muſt do by often.</p>
                     <p>And Laſtly, We may ad, That in a confirmed Conſumption that is deſperate, the Hair falls off, the Cheeks wax blue, except it be after meat, and then the vapors ſent up make the red Lice breed in abundance, and the Feet ſwel.</p>
                     <p>Neither need we ſo many ſigns, for if any ordinary man, ſaith <hi>Areteus,</hi> ſhal ſee a man pale, weak, and coughing, and very lean, he wil conclude him to be in a Conſumption.</p>
                     <p>Yet we muſt obſerve diligently, That ſomtimes a violent Catarrh falling upon the Lungs wil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble a Conſumption ſo, that filth like Matter, ſhal be ſpit forth, and thence may a Feaver come through putrifaction and extenuation of body: but they who are ſo are eaſily cured by diligence in means, therefore let us diſtinguiſh this rightly from a Conſumption, which is chiefly done by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning between putrid Flegm and Matter. Thus;</p>
                     <p>Matter is of a dun Colour, and leſs White than Flegm; ſomtimes of divers Colours, and being put into hot Water it ſinketh and diſſolveth: but Flegm ſwims at the top and ſticks together by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of its ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>inineſs, and wil not diſſolve.</p>
                     <p>But if ſome of the Spittle diſſolve and the reſt not, it is made of Flegm and Matter, which often happeneth.</p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſtick, it is very hard to Cure a new Ulcer in the Lungs; but it is impoſſible to Cure an Old, becauſe it is opened by the continual motion of the Lungs and by Coughing, ſo that it wil not be united: as alſo the force of the Medicine is gone before it can come at it, and the loſt ſubſtance of the Lungs cannot be repaired.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, An Ulcer, Spittle, Feaver, and Leanneſs, require contrary Remedies, for thoſe things which dry the Ulcer, do hinder Spittle, increaſe the Feaver, and Leanneſs: and Moiſt things which are good againſt the Feaver and Leanneſs, do make the Ulcer more foul.</p>
                     <p>Somtimes the Ulcer ſeems Cured, and there is a ſcab upon it, but with the leaſt motion it fals off, and the Diſeaſe returns.</p>
                     <p>A Conſumption which comes from a ſmal Ulcer of ſhort continuance, although it be difficult, yet is not uncurable if proper Medicines be timely uſed: And they who have gathered Obſervations mention many ſo Cured; now there is moſt hope when the Patient is ſtrong, the ſpittle white, even of one colour, and eaſily raiſed; if the humor falling from the head paſs through the Noſe, and if thereupon the Feaver abate, if the Appetite be good, &amp; there be no thirſt, &amp; if the belly bound &amp; in good order, if the Patient have a good habit of body, yong, and have his breaſt large and hairy.</p>
                     <p>They whoſe ſpittle ſtinketh, or have looſe bellies, or cannot ſpet, are neer death, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> teacheth, 1. Prog. &amp; Aph. 11. &amp; 12. Sect. 5. And, Aph. 16. Sect. 7.</p>
                     <p>A Conſumption coming upon an acute Diſeaſe doth kill ſpeedily, but if it come from other Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it is Chronical, and laſteth many yeers: And <hi>Avicen</hi> ſaith, That he knew a Woman that lived twenty three yeers in a Conſumption. And <hi>Matthew de Gradi</hi> ſaith, That another Woman which was alwayes about the fire, lived in a Conſumption twenty eight yeers.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of this Diſeaſe, as is ſaid, is for the moſt part impoſſible, if the Diſeaſe be Old; but if it be New it may ſomtimes, and eaſier when it is but coming upon them who are diſpoſed thereto by
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:49088:103"/>
an hereditary diſpoſition, but are not yet fallen into it. Therefore we ſhal firſt lay down a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylactick or preſervative, and then ſhew how to cure the diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>Therefore for the amending of the evil diſpoſition in a Conſumption, uſe a cooling diet, and moiſt, and all ſuch things as correct the blood, and make it mild, and correct its ſaltneſs and ſharpneſs: as the Waters of ſweet Baths, the uſe of Milk and the like. As alſo China Roots boyled in ſmal Beer; but the Decoction of the Sanders is the beſt, which is not only good in a Conſumption at hand, or begun, but alſo in ſalt and thin diſtillations, and in old bleeding from thence. The Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Guajacum doth wonders upon the ſame account with the former, either given in diſtilled Waters, with a little white or red Wine, as the diſeaſe will bear it. Now the Decoction of Guaja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum, and of Sanders, are made both alike, both for the firſt and ſecond drink, and given the ſame way. To theſe you may ad change of Air, which is good both to prevent and cure, And laſtly, thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies are good which we will lay down for the cure of the diſeaſe confirmed, to be uſed firſt.</p>
                     <p>Now the whol Cure conſiſteth in the cleſing and glutinating of the ulcer, by taking away the Cauſes that produce and nouriſh it, by oppoſing the Hectick Feavet, and reſtraining of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</p>
                     <p>Firſt therefore, becauſe an ill habit of body may encreaſe the Ulcer of the Lungs, you muſt uſe gentle purges, at divers diſtances, as long as the body is not very low. And theſe muſt be made of Manna, Rhubarb, Caſſia, or Syrup of Roſes, thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Barley half a pugil: Liquoris ſcraped, and Raiſons ſtoned, of each three drams: Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jubes four: the flowers of Bugloſs, and Violets, of each half a pugil: boyl them to three ounces: In the ſtraining diſſolve Rhubarb infuſed in Scabious Water with yellow Sanders four ſcruples: Manna one ounce: Syrup of Roſes half an ounce. Make a Potion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or give two ounces of Manna with Chicken or ordinary Broth.</p>
                     <p>Or make a Bolus of Caſſia one ounce, and one ſcruple of the pouder of Liquoris.</p>
                     <p>In the beginning you may give ſtronger purges for to draw down the ſalt and ſharp Catarrh which is the chief Cauſe of the Ulcer, ſuch as are preſcribed in a hot Catarrh.</p>
                     <p>Alſo before the body be too lean, at the firſt you may let blood to allay the Feaver, and the acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the humor.</p>
                     <p>But in the beginning of the Cure you muſt ſtay and divert the Catarrh from the Breaſt, otherwiſe all other things will be in vain. And all thoſe things which were preſcribed for the Cure of a hot Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrh are good in this caſe.</p>
                     <p>Beſides a Seton to the Neck, is very good. And <hi>Fabricius Hildanus</hi> reports that he cured many by this way.</p>
                     <p>At length you muſt come to the Cure of the Ulcer; for which, give things that clenſe, knit, and expectorate. Many there are of this nature. But theſe following are the beſt.</p>
                     <p>Milk doth hit all intentions for Cure: It clenſeth with its ſerous parts, it conglutinateth with its coagulating part, and nouriſheth and refreſheth with its unctious part. But there are divers kinds of Milk, and Womans Milk is the beſt, becauſe it is more agreeable to our Natures, eſpecially if it be ſucked from the breaſt. <hi>Platerus</hi> affirms that he knew many cured by the uſe thereof; and that one of them did not only recover, but grew ſo ſtrong, that leaſt his Nurſe ſhould want milk for him, he got her with child again.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe many will not endure that ſort, Aſſes Milk is commended, which becauſe it is very full of Whey, doth eaſily pierce into the Veins, and excellently clenſe the Ulcer: the next to this is Goats Milk. Let the Aſs be fed with Plantane, Vine Leaves, Brambles, Polyganon, Graſs, Barley, and Rye. Let him drink it new milked, warm, therefore let the Aſs be brought neer the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and be milked into a warm Veſſel. Firſt let him take it in a ſmal quantity three or four ounces, that his Stomach may be uſed to it, encreaſing the quantity by degrees to eight or ten ounces, or a pint, and leaſt it ſhould grow ſowr or curdle in the Stomach: and that it may agree better with the Lungs, put Sugar of Roſes to it, one ounce thereof to eight of milk: let him not ſleep after his Milk immediately, but walk gently about the Chamber: let him not eat before the Milk be concocted, and he find a ſtomach, and that it be more effectual. You muſt not give it in a ſtrong Feaver, or when there is a pain in the Head, or ſwelling in the Hypochondria, or a Chollerick flux, according to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> Aphor. 64. Sect. 5.</p>
                     <p>Commonly it is taken only once in a day; but it is better twice; and beſt if the Patient live only upon it. For beſides that it doth work more powerfully in a great quantity, there is a great profit by not mixing it with Broth and other meats, for they will eaſily putrifie. If therefore the Diſeaſe be very deſperate, give Milk after purging every ſix hours with <hi>Manus Chriſti</hi> of Pearl and Coral. And leaſt ſtrength ſhould fail, let him intermix a reſtoring diſtilled Water.</p>
                     <p>Sugar of Roſes is very profitable, as alſo the Conſerve; by uſe whereof, <hi>Avicen</hi> reports that he cured a Woman of a deſperate Conſumption, ſo that ſhe was not only ſound, but very fat afterwards.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="175" facs="tcp:49088:103"/>
                        <hi>Meſue</hi> alſo witneſſeth that many have been recovered by the ſame, and he directeth that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve of Roſes be new, not above a yeer old, taken in a great quantity, and often, with Medicines, Meat, and drink, and alſo by it ſelf at any hour. But firſt give Clenſers, becauſe it will otherwiſe aſtringe and retain the excrementitious matter in the Lungs. But when breath begins to fail, and the Patient cannot raiſe flegm, let him take expectorating things; as Syrup of Hyſop and Coltsfoot, and other Lohochs. And if heat ariſe from drying too much, give Syrup of Violets, Jujubes, the Mucilage of Fleabane and Quinces, and the like.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Montanus, Valeriola,</hi> and <hi>Foreſtus,</hi> ſay that they have ſeen ſome cured by taking Sugar of Roſes in great quantities. An Apothecary whom I knew in a Conſumption, made a great quantity of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar of Roſes for himſelf, and eat it conſtantly, by which he was cured.</p>
                     <p>An Infuſion of Yarrow, Tormentil, Burnet, and Conſerve of Roſes made in <hi>Balneo Mariae,</hi> is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good, as it is deſcribed in the Chapter of ſpitting of blood, if it be uſed twenty daies together.</p>
                     <p>The Decoction of Bugle in Mutton Broth, doth excellent againſt a Conſumption and inward ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, it doth a little gently looſen the belly againſt the Nature of all the Conſolidae.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Trallianus, lib. 7. cap.</hi> 1. boaſts that he cured many with Blood-ſtone. The preparation and uſe whereof we have ſhewed in the Cure of ſpitting blood.</p>
                     <p>The Syrup of the Juyce of Ground Ivy is commended by <hi>Quercetan,</hi> thus made:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Juyce of Ground Ivy two pound and an half: let it be digeſted in</hi> Balneo Mariae. <hi>To this Juyce well refined, put Sugar of Roſes one pound; Penides four ounces: Boyl them to Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup, to be taken now and then a spoonful.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He alſo addeth the flower of Brimſtone to it to make it into a Lohoch, of which he gives four times in a day; and he boaſteth that he hath therewith cured many.</p>
                     <p>The Syrup of the flowers of St. Johns wort, made by Infuſion in <hi>Balneo Mariae,</hi> is very good in this Diſeaſe, as alſo for all inward ulcers.</p>
                     <p>The Syrup of Comfry is excellent; for it clenſeth, healeth, and ſtrengtheneth by aſtringing; as alſo Comphry Roots boyled in Broth</p>
                     <p>It is affirmed that many have been cured by this Hydromel.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>China Roots ſliced, ſix ounces: Coltsfoot Roots three ounces: Burdock and Avens Roots, of each three ounces: Elicampane Roots two ounces: Lungwort Leaves, and Scabious Leaves and Roots, both the Veronicaes, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lmaria, and Herb Two-pence, of each two handfuls: all the Capillar Herbs, of each one handful: the tops of Bugle, Bettony, Cowſlip flowers, and red Veronica, of each four pugils: Ground Ivy Leaves and Roots three handfuls: Jujubes, Dates, Sebeſtens, and Raiſons ſtoned, of each one ounce and an half: Spaniſh Liquoris one ounce and an half. Let them all, being well ſliced, boyl in thirty two pints of ſpring Water till half be conſumed, with a little gentle fire: ad to the Liquor being ſtrained, of the beſt Honey four pound: Boyl it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and skim it; then ſtrain it through an Hippocras Bag, putting thereto half an ounce of Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon, ſix drams of Coriander ſeeds: Annis and ſweet Fennel ſeeds, of each three drams: put the Liquor in a large Veſſel, and let it work in the Sun; for ſo it will be done in forty daies; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it will be longer: but you muſt keep the Veſſel alwaies full and open, that it may froath over: therefore you muſt make more Hydromel than the Veſſel will contain; and if the diſeaſe require it you may uſe it freſh before it worketh till you make another in the Veſſel; and you may make this quantity twice or thrice at once, becauſe it muſt be taken divers months together. Let him take a good draught hereof twice or thrice in a day.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This following Syrup is made more eaſily, and hath great Vertue:</p>

Make a Syrup well boyled, adding in the end three drams of the Extract of Juniper; Juyce of Liquoris and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of Carduus, of each four ſcruples. Let the Patient take one ſpoonful an hour before dinner, and another before ſupper, and another at bed-time.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Cardanus</hi> ſaith, that he cured many Conſumptions with this courſe following: namely, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no other nouriſhment than Barley Broth made without Fleſh, and Water with Sugar, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry morning four ounces of the Decoction of the Tails and Legs of Cray-fiſh made in Barley Water with two drams of Sugar.</p>

                        <hi>Chap. 1.</hi> Of <hi>Syncope,</hi> or Swooning.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Syncope</hi> is defined by <hi>Galen,</hi> 12. meth. c. 5. to be a ſudden failing of all the Strength: For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Heart only ſuffer, and the Vital Spirits are only intercepted; yet when it fails, the reſt muſt ſuffer, becauſe they have a continual and neceſſary influence from it.</p>
                     <p>It is called a ſudden failing of all the Strength, that it may be diſtinguiſhed from other Diſeaſes, in which the ſtrength goes by degrees, till death come: nor is the Doctrine of <hi>Avicen</hi> againſt it, <hi>Fen. 1. Lib. 3. Tract. 2. Cap.</hi> 2. where he propounds the ſign of a Syncope that comes by degrees; for although the Cauſes that diſſolve the Spirits, do ſomtimes work by degrees, yet when they grow great they make a ſudden Syncope: and therefore <hi>Avicen</hi> rather propoundeth the ſigns that go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Syncope, than thoſe that accompany it.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, This Definition may ſeem to agree with an Apoplexy, in which there is a ſudden fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of all the ſtrength; but in an Apoplexy there is ſtrength in the Heart, and the Pulſe is generally great and full. And alſo there is great hinderance of breath, with ſnorting; but in a Syncope the breath is no waies ſtopped.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="179" facs="tcp:49088:105"/>The queſtion is, Why? When the action of the heart ceaſeth, doth the action of the Brain alſo ceaſe, ſince the Animal Spirit is made of the Vital by way of Concoction, and muſt therefore ſtay ſome time in the Brain, although the Vital do not conſtantly come to it? We anſwer, That the Brain as all other parts, for the perfecting of its actions doth alwaies ſtand in need of adventitious heat, which is brought to it by the Vital Spirits, and therefore when the Vital Spirits come not, neither doth heat come for the Brain to perform its functions.</p>
                     <p>There are other Diſeaſes very like to Syncope, differing only in degrees from it, namely, <hi>Ecluſis, Leipothumia,</hi> and <hi>Aſphuxia: Ecluſis,</hi> is a light fainting: <hi>Leipothumia,</hi> or <hi>Leipopſuchia,</hi> or <hi>Apopſuchia,</hi> is a very ſtrong and great fainting: <hi>Syncope</hi> is the greateſt, which if it go ſo far that the pulſe in the whol Body ceaſeth to beat, it is called <hi>Asphyxia,</hi> which is next unto death.</p>
                     <p>The word <hi>Synchope,</hi> was not uſed by <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and the Ancient Greeks; but they call'd this Diſeaſe <hi>Leipothymia, Lipopſychia,</hi> and <hi>Aſphyxia.</hi> But it was invented a little before <hi>Galens</hi> time, and uſed for the greateſt; ſo <hi>Galen, 1. ad. Glauc. cap.</hi> 14. ſaith, <hi>Leipothymia</hi> is an imperfect Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cope, and goes before it.</p>
                     <p>By what hath been ſaid, it appears, that the part affected is the Heart, where the Vital Spirits are all made; by whoſe influence the Natural heat and Spirits in every part are made to act: therefore when that ceaſeth by ſtoppage of the Influx of the Vital Spirits, it is neceſſary that the ſtrength of all parts ſhould fail, and their actions ceaſe.</p>
                     <p>The immediate Cauſe of this Diſeaſe, is the defect of the Vital Spirits, not wholly, for then ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den death would come; but ſo great, that Nature is conſtrained (leſt the ſtrength of the Heart ſhould totally fail) to fetch the Spirits from the other parts to the Heart, by which means the parts loſe their functions.</p>
                     <p>Now this defect of Spirits comes four waies: Either becauſe they are Naturally few; or becauſe they are diſſipated, and ſpent; or becauſe they are preternaturally altered and corrupted; or laſtly, becauſe they are ſuffocated and deſtroyed: They are few by fault of the faculty making, or matter from which they are made. The Faculty is hurt, either by a diſeaſe proper to the Heart, or by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from another part.</p>
                     <p>The proper Diſeaſes of the Heart which are the chief, are great diſtempers, which overthrow the Natural temper, or deſtroy the ſubſtance of the parts, or of the Natural heat; as ſwooning Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, ſharp, and malignant, <hi>Syntacticae,</hi> or <hi>Colliquantes,</hi> or fainting, peſtilential, hectical, or <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſmodes,</hi> which conſume; to this come organical diſeaſes, as too much conſtriction and dilatation, and conſtant ſolutions, which come to the Ventricles of the Heart.</p>
                     <p>The Faculty may be hurt by conſent from other parts, which have great ſympathy with the Heart, as the Brain and Liver, and ſomtimes from the mouth of the Stomach, by reaſon of its neerneſs and exquiſite ſence; from whence a Syncope is divided into a Heart and Stomach Syncope. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaca or Heart Syncope, is when the Heart is principally affected; but the Stomachia, or Stomach Syncope, is that which comes by conſent from the Stomach. Somtimes it comes from the Mother, by filthy vapors ſent from thence to the Heart, from whence comes the Suffocation of the Matrix, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noea, or want of breath, and Hyſterical Syncopes, as thoſe vapors do aſſault the Lungs, Diaphragma, or the Heart.</p>
                     <p>The fault is in the Matter, when the Air or Blood is defective, or corrupted; from whence the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Spirits are generated. There is defect of Air when the Reſpiration and Tranſpiration is hindered; but the defect of Blood, is when Nutrition is hindered; there is a corruption of both, when their qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities are changed: So when the Air is infected in time of Peſtilence, it begets Leipothymia and Syncope, as alſo ſtinking vapors, and ſweet alſo do the ſame with ſome Women; and the blood is corrupted from evil meats.</p>
                     <p>Too great Evacuations, whether ſenſible or inſenſible, do diſperſe the Spirits. The ſenſible are chiefly of Blood, from the Mouth, Noſe, Womb, Belly, Hemorrhoids, Phlebotomy, and great Wounds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and next of other Humors, which though they are Excrementitious, yet becauſe of their great Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation the Spirits are much diſperſed, and cauſe a Syncope. Theſe Humors are diſcharged by Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, Stool, Urine, Sweat, the opening of a great Impoſthume, eſpecially if it be inward, as an Empye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma; or outward, as in a Dropſie when the Navil is tapped.</p>
                     <p>The inſenſible Evacuations are by the Rarifaction of the Skin, and by the acrimony and thinneſs of the Humors, immoderate heat, hot Baths or Houſes, great Labors. Alſo long watchings, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, Lechery, great anger, and joy, long and violent ſickneſs do diſſipate the Spirits; as alſo great pain of the Heart, Stomach, Guts, Reins, Ears, Teeth, and of all Nervous parts.</p>
                     <p>An evil diſpoſition of the Bowels doth alter and corrupt the Spirits, and whatſoever doth procure a malignant quality which is adverſe to the Heart, as Air, Stinks, venemous and peſtilential, taken in by the Breath, or bred in the Body from putrifaction of Humors; as alſo poyſon taken in, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied outward, or ſent to the Heart by biting of venemous Creatures.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, The vehement returning of blood and Spirits to the Heart, and an abundance of evil va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors

                     <p>We lately ſaw a Noble Lady, a Virgin, which from her Infancy was ſubject to this Diſeaſe, that with every light paſſion of the mind ſhe was taken therwith, taken with a violent Syncope which uſhered death in by a ſudden return of blood and Spirits to her heart; for when ſhe ſhould have been married to a fine yong man which loved her deerly, and her Parents, Friends, and Kindred were ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly met about it, they gave her a Pen to write her hand to the Contract; but ſhe having not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly written her name fel down dead upon the ground: Hence we eaſily conjecture, that there was a great and ſudden retraction of the Blood and Spirits to the Heart by a vehement paſſion of the mind, which choaked the Natural heat, and the Spirits therein, of which ſhe died ſuddenly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Petrus Salius Diverſus</hi> ſaw, as he reporteth, Lib. de aff part. cap. 4. a Girle of fourteen years old fal into a Syncope from abundance of cold and thick blood garhered about her heart and the great veſſels: for having for a whol day a heavineſs of head with giddineſs and diſturbance. ſhe died the next day after ſuddenly: After being opened, the blood appeared ſo congealed in the great Artay and Vena Cava or hollow Vein, that taking it by the end you might draw it out like a Sword from a Scabbard.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore we judged, That the ſudden death came from the interception and ſtopping of the Veins by congealed blood.</p>
                     <p>This happeneth ſeldom, for you ſhal ſeldom ſee blood in dead bodies ſo congealed: for the veins have ſuch a property to retain blood, that even after death they keep it thin, though without them it growth alwayes thick.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Salius</hi> gives the Reaſon of this Congealation by comparing it with blood without the Veſſels, which as ſoon as it is cold, is congealed; and the ſooner from the coldneſs, thickneſs and ſlymineſs of the Melanchollick or Phlegmatick humor therein contained.</p>
                     <p>Somthing like to this may be-ſal blood conſtrained in the veins which abounding with vicious juyce thick and cold, doth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o ſill the greater Veins, that it ſtops the ſpirits, and ſo extinguiſheth them: and then the blood grows cold and thick, from thoſe humors which otherwiſe would have been thin.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Spagiricks</hi> refer this to a congealing Spirit, made of a peculiar and extraordinary mixture of Humors, which ſince it ſeldom happeneth, the Diſeaſe is very rare: And truly a ſimple Refrigera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot cauſe that concretion, for then in dead bodies, eſpecially in winter, the blood would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be thick in the Veins, but we find it alwaies thin; but we may ſuppoſe that this Congealing Spirit is like that which cauſeth a Catalepſis, or Congealation which makes the parts inflexible.</p>
                     <p>The Chymiſts do acknowledge ſuch kind of Congealing Spirits to be in many Creatures, Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, and Minerals; ſuch as are reported to be raiſed out of the Earth, in ſome Hiſtories of Men and Beaſts who have been Congealed by filthy vapors coming from Earth-quakes, or Dens; ſo, that their bodies became preſently ſtiffe: And <hi>Cardanus</hi> ſaith, That ſuch ſpirits are in Thunder-bolts, in his Hiſtory of the Eight Mowers, who Supping under an Oak were ſtruck ſtiffe, and remained as at firſt, the one ſeeming to Eat, the other to reach the Pot, and the other to Drink.</p>
                     <p>The Signs to this Diſeaſe by either are from the Subject which is more capable to receive it, or from the Fit either coming or preſent, or from the Cauſes that produce it.</p>
                     <p>The Subjects which are moſt fit to receive a Syncope are men who by ſome Natural Debility or Weakneſs from ſome Diſeaſe, become faint-hearted. Women rather than Men, eſpecially in their Terms, or with Child: As alſo they who have fine Conſtitutions, ſubject to the Jaundice, Spleen, or Melancholly.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things ſignifie that a Syncope is coming to them who are ſubject to it; Anxiety and ſudden diſturbance of mind, heavineſs in the head, giddineſs, an apprehenſion of divers colours, green, and yellow, a ſudden and often change of the colour in the face, and of the beating of the Pulſe.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Leipothymy</hi> is preſent the ſame ſigns are, but greater; and there is often a cold ſweat, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the ſick complain of their faintneſs.</p>
                     <p>But theſe ſigns ſhew a Syncope, A ſudden failing of al ſtrength, a ſlow pulſe, low and at length ſtopping, a pale and blewiſh face, coldneſs of al the body, eſpecially externally; a cold ſweat eſpecially in the temples, neck, and breaſt, from whence the Diſeaſe is named.</p>
                     <p>The ſigns of the Cauſes are commonly manifeſt, for Feavers malignant, acute, ſyncopal or fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, cauſe a proper Syncope or Swoonding, are eaſily known: As alſo thoſe external Cauſes which make a ſudden Syncope, may be plainly ſeen, As Anger extraordinary and Joy, a ſudden Fright, ſtinking ſmels, great bleeding, and other large evacuations, long watchings, and faſting, much leche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and grievous pain.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things do ſignifie that the Humors and the Body are thin, a ſharp noſe, hollow eyes, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples fallen; and the gnawing of the mouth of the ſtomach, trouble of mind, pricking, heat and great pain, do ſhew abundance of Choller.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="181" facs="tcp:49088:106"/>When there is abundance of crude Humors you may know by the enlarging of the body, ſwelling about the breaſt, a pale colour, black and blew, a ſmal, obſcure, and unequal pulſe.</p>
                     <p>A ſwoonding by way of Sympathy from other parts, is known by the ſign of thoſe parts affected; ſo that if it come from the ſtomach, that hath been diſtempered with loathing vomiting, gnawing, the mouth hath been bitter, and dry, and the like. The ſame Judgement is to be taken in other parts: but if you ſee no ſign of any other part affected, you may conclude that it comes principally from the heart.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, A Syncope is diſtinguiſhed from other Diſeaſes by its proper ſigns. From an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepſy, becauſe that hath a Convulſion, but a Syncope not: From an Apoplexy, becauſe in that the breath is ſtopt, and there is often ſnorting, and the pulſe is not much abated, except when Death is at hand; but in a Syncope the Pulſe is almoſt gone, and the breath is free. It is diſtinguiſhed from the Mother, for in that the breathing parts are moſt affected, ſo that the Patient is almoſt ſtrangled, but the Pulſe is not much altered, nor the colour of the face, but keeps its natural complection, and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is higher coloured; but in a Syncope the breath is not ſtopt, but the pulſe is almoſt gone, and the face is pale: But ſomtimes a Syncope is joyned with the Suffocation of the Mother, and then the Pulſe is not perceived.</p>
                     <p>The Prognoſtick of this Diſeaſe is firſt taken from <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> Aph. 41. Sect. 2. <hi>They who often and violently faint without a manifeſt Cauſe, do die ſuddenly.</hi> For as it is ſaid, a great Syncope doth quite take away the ſtrength from the heart.</p>
                     <p>A Syncope from which a man is not recovered by Roſe Water thrown in his face, and Wine given to drink with ſneezing-pouder put into the Noſe is deadly.</p>
                     <p>When one is raiſed from a Syncope, health is not to be promiſed; for if his Pulſe return not, but his colour be wan, and he ſtill be cold, he wil quickly Relapſe, in which is danger.</p>
                     <p>That Syncope which comes from immoderate Evacuations, fear, ſorrow, or ſome evident Cauſe, is of leſs danger than that which comes from an internal Cauſe.</p>
                     <p>As for the Cure, becauſe it comes from divers Cauſes, it muſt be various.</p>
                     <p>But of what Cauſe ſoever it come, in the time of the Fit theſe are good, Lying upon the back, throwing of cold Water in the face, provoking to neez, putting of ſtrong Wine, Cinnamon, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Water, Aqua vitae, Coeleſtis, and the like into the mouth, holding of hot bread to the Noſe, loud calling and ſhaking, ſtopping of the Noſtrils; wringing of the Fingers, pulling of the Hair, rubbing, binding, and cupping.</p>
                     <p>But in reſpect of the Cauſes which are divers, you muſt vary the Cure thus:</p>
                     <p>If it come from want of meat, he wil be Cured with ſtrong Wine, and a Toaſt, or Sop: Alſo with nouriſhing broths, and Reſtoring diſtilled Waters among other things, a diſh of Eggs with ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, Wine and Cinnamon deſcribed in the following Chapter.</p>
                     <p>If it come from thinneſs of the Humors by which the ſpirits do eaſily flie away, give him ſweet things and meats of good juyce, and thickning; let the pores of the skin be ſtopt with Oyl of Roſes, and let the Patient ſtay in a cold place.</p>
                     <p>If it come from the Mother, you muſt give Medicines for that.</p>
                     <p>If it come from ſome evil quality, give Cordials and Antidotes, ſuch as are preſcribed in malignant Feavers.</p>
                     <p>If from poyſon, give things to expel it: Firſt a Vomit, and then Treacle; and then if he feel burning or gnawing in the Guts, let him take Milk of Butter, or fat Broth, or cooling Cordial Potions.</p>
                     <p>If it come of immoderate Evacuation, let the Patient be refreſhed with Scents, Meat, Drink, ſleep, and reſt.</p>
                     <p>If from too great loſs of Blood, lay him upon his bed, with his Head backwards, daſh his face with cold Water, give him a little Wine with cold Water.</p>
                     <p>If it come of too much Purging, give him new Treacle, or old if you cannot get new, with two grains of Opium diſſolved in Wine, or three grains of Laudanum which is better. And let the Belly be anointed all over with this following Oyl:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Oyl of Myrtles, and Quinces, of each one ounce and an half: Oyl of Wormwood one ounce: With a little Roſe Vinegar mix them and anoint often.</hi>

                     <p>AS in a Synoope the motion of the Heart is diminiſhed, ſo in this Diſeaſe it is depraved. It i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Galen</hi> in his Book of Trembling, Palpitation, and Convulſion, ſaith, That Palpitation comes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Diſeaſe that is from the Cauſe which lifteth up, and depreſſeth the part, without any help of the Faculty; but Trembling comes partly from the Faculty, partly from the Diſeaſe. Hence it is that many uſing the word Palpitation indifferently to any part, think it is in the Heart, as in the Skin and Muſcles, in which it comes from wind driven violently thither: for if the Heart be moved as a Bladder by water or wind, they ſuppoſe that to be a Palpitation. But the reaſon is different; for the Skin and Muſcles cannot naturally dilate and contract themſelves, but by Diſeaſes. But the Heart hath a Natural Faculty to contract and dilate it ſelf, therefo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e a Palpitation cannot be without its motion. And they do in vain muſter up <hi>Galens</hi> Reaſons, ſo thought by them, to prove that the Palpitation of the Heart comes not by Nature, but by a Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eaſe, or cauſe of a Diſeaſe. For <hi>Galen</hi> in all thoſe places ſpeaks of no other Palpitation than that which is in the Skin and other external parts, and not of the palpitation of the Heart, which is of another Nature; and <hi>Galen</hi> 2. de ſympt. cauſ. cap. 2. ſaith that the Palpitation of the Heart and Arteries, is different from that of the other parts.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the Palpitation of the Heart is an immoderate and preternatural ſhaking of the part, with a great Diaſtole or Dilatation, and a vehement Syſtole or contraction which ſomtimes is ſo great that as <hi>Fernelius</hi> obſerves, it hath often broken the Ribs adjoyning, &amp; ſomtimes diſplaced them which are over the Paps; and ſomtimes it hath ſo dilated an Artery forth into an Aneuriſm as big as ones fiſt, in which you might both ſee and feel the pulſation.</p>
                     <p>This immoderate ſhaking of the Heart comes from the Pulſative Faculty provoked.</p>
                     <p>But here may be objected, That in Feavers all theſe things are found, for this is an immoderat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>To this we anſwer, That the motion of the Heart in Feavers is diſtinguiſhed from Palpitation, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by its degrees, and the depraved motion of the Heart when it is vehement, is called Palpitation; but if it be not vehement, it is called a quick, great, and ſwift Pulſe, and is referred to the difference<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Now the Efficient Cauſes of this Palpitation may be referred to Three Heads: Either it is ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what which troubleth and pricketh; or neceſſity of Refrigeration; or defect of Spirits: which two latter may be referred to the encreaſe of Cuſtom.</p>
                     <p>The Moleſting Cauſe is moſt uſual, ſo that many Authors knew no other, the other are rare, and that is either a vapor or wind which troubleth the Heart either in quantity or quality, or both. The quality is either manifeſt or occult<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p>A vapor troubleſom in a manifeſt quality, is either in the Heart and its parts adjoyning; or it is ſent from other parts; and this ſuddenly getting to the inmoſt parts of the Heart, doth ſtir up the Expul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="181" facs="tcp:49088:107"/>In the Heart, and thereabout, eſpecially in the Pericardium, are gathered ſomtimes cold and thick Humors, which ſend up vapors to the Ventricles of the Heart, which cauſe Palpitation.</p>
                     <p>But from more remote parts, vapors and wind are ſent to the Ventricles of the Heart; as from the Stomach, Spleen, Mother, and the other parts of the lower Belly.</p>
                     <p>Many times a Vapor that troubles the Heart by an occult quality, ariſeth in malignant Feavers, Plague, and after Poyſon, and ſomtimes from Worms putrified, and the terms ſtopped from corrupt feed, or other putrid matter which do much ſtir up the Expulſive Faculty thereof.</p>
                     <p>Divers Humors do moleſt the Heart, either with their quantity or quality; ſo too much Blood oppreſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Humors offending in quality, hurt the Heart, if they be venemous, putrid, corrupt, ſharp, or too hot, eſpecially burnt Choller coming to the Heart, and provoking its Expulſion.</p>

So <hi>Platerus</hi> reports, that in one who had a long Palpitation, and died thereof, there was found a bone in his Heart. But <hi>Schenkius</hi> reports, that in a Prieſt who was from his youth to the age of forty two trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with a Palpitation, there was found in the bottom of his Heart an Excreſcens of fleſh which weighed eight drams, and reſembled another Heart.</p>
                     <p>The Second Cauſe of Palpitation is neceſſity of refrigeration, which is, when there is a pret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

As <hi>Platerus</hi> obſerved in a yong man, who being hot and angry at Tennis, fell into a Palpitation of the Heart, and ſo died.</p>
                     <p>The third Cauſe, is the defect of Spirits which comes by hunger, watching, anger, Joy, fear, ſhame, and great Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The Diagnoſis or knowledg of this Diſeaſe, is directed either to the Diſeaſe, or the Cauſes which produce it.</p>
                     <p>The Diſeaſe is ſubject to ſence; it may be felt with the hands, ſomtimes ſeen and heard; for the Artery may be ſeen to leap eſpecially in the Jugular. And <hi>Foreſtus</hi> ſaith it may be heard, by an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of a yong man, that they who paſſed by might hear it by laying their Ear to the Window.</p>
                     <p>Alſo the Cauſes are diſtinguiſhed by their Signs: A hot diſtemper is known by the greatneſs of the Pulſe and ſwiftneſs, by a Feaver and heat of the Breaſt, by great and often breathing, and deſire of cold things.</p>
                     <p>If the Palpitation come of wind, it quickly comes and goes, and is preſently raiſed by little moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Breath is difficult, with trembling ſomtimes at the knees, miſts in the Eyes, noiſe in the Ears, and ſomtimes pain of ſome part, which quickly is gon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>If the Palpitation come from Humors in the Heart, the Diſeaſe doth not come ſo ſuddenly, and continueth longer, and you may know what kind of humor it is by the ſigns of the Humor which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds throughout the whol Body. And eſpecially if it be from Blood, from which it moſt often proceedeth; and this is known by a divers and unequal Pulſe, ſomtimes great, ſomtimes ſmal, ſlow, and ſwift, to which the Breathing anſwereth in proportion; the Patients heart ſeemeth to be bound and oppreſſed, as appears by the exceeding heat, diſtenſion of the Veins, redneſs of Face, the time being Spring, the Age, Region, and Diet cauſing Blood to abound<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                        <pb n="184" facs="tcp:49088:108"/>That which comes by conſent from other parts, is known by the proper ſigns of the parts affected, ſo we know that it is from the ſtomach, when there is want of Appetite, loathing, vomiting of baſe Humors, and gnawing at the Stomach. A troubleſom breathing about the Pancreas or Spleen, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other diſeaſe of the Spleen, ſheweth that the matter lurketh there, from whence the vapors fly to the Heart; ſo ſuppreſſion of the Terms, and Hyſterical fits, declare that it comes from the Womb.</p>
                     <p>The Water abounding in the Pericardium is harder to be known, but we may conjecture, if the Pulſe be weak and faint, and the Patient bemoaneth himſelf, that his heart as it were is ſomtimes in Water, and is ſuffocated, and if it be conſtant, and he incline to an Atrophy or Hectick.</p>
                     <p>If malignant humors cauſe it, there will be great change in the Pulſe, a loſs of ſtrength, ſomtimes fainting, and other ſigns of malignity.</p>
                     <p>If it come from a Tumor there is remarkable variety in the Pulſe, and the motion of the Heart is different from the natural, very unequal and inordinate, and if the humor be hot, there will be great inflamation in the Body, great thirſt, difficulty of breathing and fainting will follow with death: but if the Tumor be hard, and in the Pericardium, the diſeaſe is conſtant, and the Patient de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayes by degrees without any manifeſt cauſe: if fleſh, or any more ſolid thing grow to the heart, there will be a continual Palpitation from the beginning of the Diſeaſe to the end of Life.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, You may know when it comes by want of Spirits, by the precedent cauſes, which deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Spirits, and by the quick and ſmal pulſe, and when it comes from the leaſt labor or motion. Somtimes the like befals them that are well from walking or other motion, with a change of Pulſe, and a reſembling Palpitation.</p>
                     <p>The Prognoſtick is to be taken thus: It is dangerous from the hinderance of the motion of the Heart, by which Life is preſerved, and it brings Syncopes and death: For it is a true Obſervation of <hi>Galen,</hi> Com. Aph. 41. Sect. 2. and 5. de loc. aff. cap. 2. All that in youth, or in declining age are troubled with the Palpitation of the Heart very much, die before they are old; for the often Palpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is a ſign that the Vital faculty was very weak.</p>
                     <p>A Palpitation by Propriety is worſe than by conſent, and ſomtimes deadly. And that which is of an internal, is worſe than that which comes of an external Cauſe, unleſs it be from poyſon, or ſome great wound.</p>
                     <p>If it come from a Tumor, or ſolution of Unity, it is incurable.</p>
                     <p>The Cure is various, according to the variety of the Cauſes: and firſt that which comes from a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar diſtemper of the Heart and Pericardium, is incurable; therefore we muſt look only at the Cure of that which is by conſent, which depends upon the divers diſeaſes of the parts, whoſe Cure muſt be ſought in their proper Chapters.</p>
                     <p>But beſides thoſe Remedies which take away the Cauſe, you muſt uſe thoſe which aſſwage the Symptomes by refreſhing the Heart, and ſtrengthening it, and which diſcuſs the vapors which ariſe from melancholly, or crude &amp; wateriſh Humors; as Cordial Juleps, Opiates, Epithems, &amp; Perfumes, which are preſcribed in weakneſs, and theſe that follow.</p>

                        <hi>Chap. 3.</hi> Of WEAKNESSE.</head>
                     <p>ALthough Weakneſs of Strength doth generally comprehend the hinderance of al Actions, Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, Vital, and Natural; yet more particularly it comprehends the Vital which are known by a Weak Pulſe: yet this Weakneſs uſeth to be found in al great Diſeaſes, in which Nature doth yeild or reſiſt the Cauſe.</p>
                     <p>Therefore as in Palpitation the Action of the Heart that is Pulſation is depraved, ſo in Weakneſs it is diminiſhed.</p>
                     <p>Which is the ſame with a Syncope, but it differs in this, In a Syncope it is ſo little that it is hardly perceived; but in Weakneſs the Pulſe is manifeſt and not ſo little.</p>
                     <p>In this alſo the Animal Faculty is alwaies offended: Hence comes weak motion without hurt of the Brain, Nerves, or Muſcles, but from the defect of Vital Spirits which are not ſo ſufficiently ſent to the Head that they may be made Animal.</p>
                     <p>The immediate Cauſe of Weakneſs is Defect of the natural heat and ſpirits from which the life and ſtrength of the parts do depend.</p>
                     <p>And this Defect is in every part from the Defect of Vital Spirits, and heat flowing from the heart.</p>
                     <p>Now the Vital Spirits are Defective, either becauſe they are not bred many; or becauſe they are diſſipated after they are Bred, or Corrupted, or Suffocated, as we ſaid in a Syncope, where there is this difference, That in a Syncope the Cauſes of Defect of Spirits, do ſuddenly produce their effect; but in Weakneſs they operate by degrees. And therefore in Syncopes and Leipothymia al the Vital Spirits almoſt, do ſuddenly fail, but in this there are fewer then ought to be communicated to every part.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, When the Natural heat wants not only adventitious heat, but alſo radical moiſture to feed upon: if this moiſture be wanting and diminiſhed, the natural heat muſt be leſs, and the ſtrength abated.</p>
                     <p>Now the Cauſes which hinder the ſpirits from being Generated, or maketh them diſperſe themſelves, or Corrupt, or Suffocate them, are propounded in the Treatiſe of a Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cope.</p>
                     <p>The Diagnoſis of this Diſeaſe needs no Explication becauſe it is manifeſt, and the Patients do complain of their Weakneſs. But the ſigns of the Cauſes were Propounded in the Syncope.</p>
                     <p>The Prognoſtick depends upon the various diſpoſition of Cauſes, for as they are greater or leſs, there is more or leſs danger.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of this Diſeaſe is to be directed to two things, To the taking away of the Cauſe, and the Reſtauration of the Heart and vital ſpirits.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes are, almoſt al great Diſeaſes, in which either Nature yeilds to, or reſiſteth with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, therefore the taking away of the Cauſe belongs to the Cure of almoſt al Diſeaſes: which you muſt take from their proper Chapters.</p>
                     <p>But the ſtrengthning of the Heart, and reſtoring of the vital ſpirits are to be here declared; ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be preferred before the Cure of the Cauſe, when death ſeems to be at hand: but we muſt alwayes take heed leaſt when we encreaſe the ſtrength we encreaſe the Cauſe of the Diſeaſe: and therefore in a hot Diſeaſe you muſt uſe more temperate Cordials, but in a Cold Diſeaſe thoſe that are more hot.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then mix Cordials in his nouriſhment, as Confectio Alkermes, or Confectio de Hyacyntho in Broths, or with pleaſant Wine or Cinnamon Water, if there be great weakneſs.</p>
                     <p>Boyl alſo between two Diſhes a piece of a Leg of Mutton, after the skin and fat is taken off, and after that let the Patient drink the Broth, being ſtrained, at one daught. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>the Fleſh of a Capon after the skin and fat is taken away, cut it in pieces, and put it in a glaſſed Pot well Luted, and ſet it in Balneo Martae to boyl for five hours, then let the Patient take two or three spoonfuls of the Liquor in all his Broths.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="246" facs="tcp:49088:109"/>Or you may make a diſtilled Water thus:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>a Capon or an Hen, after the skin is taken off, and the fat, cut it in pieces; then powr upon it Water of Bugloſs, Borrage, Sorrel, Roſes, and Orange Flowers, of each half a pound: the Pouder of three Sanders, Aromaticum Roſatum, and Cinnamen, of each half an ounce: yellow Sanders one ounce: Lemmons ſliced, three.

                     </p>
                     <p>The Juyce of Legs of Mutton only is of much uſe.</p>
                     <p>Half roaſt a Leg of Mutton, and ſlaſh it upon the Spit; take the Juyce and boyl it a little in the diſh, and give it either alone, or with Broth, or with Yolks of Eggs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Valeriola</hi> doth much commend the Juyce taken out of Sheeps Hearts. And <hi>Zacutus Lucitanus</hi> confirms it by his Experience, ſaying, That he with this only Medicine a mouth continued, cured a rich man, who often ſwouned through weakneſs of the Vital Faculty, and reſolution of the Blood and Spirits, when many other Medicines had been uſed in vain.</p>
                     <p>The Juyce is thus taken forth:</p>
                     <p>Slit the Heart of a Sheep or Goat in the middle, then waſh it well, and laſt waſh it with Roſe Water; then cut it in ſlices and put it in a glaſſed Vaſſel with a few Cloves, and no other Liquor. And after the Pot is well luted, put it into the Oven after it is drawn, till the Juyce come forth. Give this to the Patient to drink.</p>
                     <p>The Italians uſe Caudles of Yolks of Eggs, Wine, Sugar, and Cinnamon, which is very reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Zacutus Lucitanus</hi> makes a fine diſh of twenty Yolks of Eggs; as you may ſee in the 107. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, Lib. 2. of his Admirable Practice.</p>

                        <hi>Chap. 1.</hi> Of Want of Appetite, or Loathing of Meat.</head>
                     <p>INappetentia, and Loathing, is either from the aboliſhed or diminiſhed Action of the ſtomach: When it is Aboliſhed it is called <hi>Anorexia, &amp; Apoſitia:</hi> but when it is Diminiſhed it is called <hi>Duſorexia,</hi> but by Cuſtom <hi>Anorexia, &amp; Apoſitia</hi> are uſed for both.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes of this Diſeaſe are divers, which that we may bring into Order, let us conſider the Natural Cauſes of Hunger or Appetite: Theſe are called by <hi>Galen,</hi> lib. 1. de ſymp. cauſ. cap. 7. Symptomes: and are Five, The Firſt whereof is emptineſs of the parts. The Second is the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Appetite of thoſe parts ſo emptied. The Third is the Sucking and Attraction of the Meſaraick Veins in the Stomach and Guts. The Fourth is the ſenſe of their ſucking in the Stomach. The Fifth is the Animal Appetite wch cometh from the Nerve in the mouth of the ſtomach which comes from the Brain, and is endued with great ſenſe and feeling. As alſo the Melanchollick Humor which comes from the Spleen to the mouth of the ſtomach, which with its ſharpneſs gnaws the inmoſt Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle of the ſtomach, and is like ſawce to ſtir up Appetite; which that it may be natural, it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that al thoſe Cauſes be in Order; for if there be any fault in either, then there is a hurt or hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Appetite.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the Firſt Cauſe which is Emptineſs of Parts, if it be wanting there is no Attraction made by them from other parts and the ſtomach, and ſo there is no Appetite: now this Emptineſs is wanting either when the parts are filled with plenty of crude juyces, by reaſon of gluttony or drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs; or for want of exerciſe, or uſual evacuations, or when there is ſo much fat that it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to nouriſh the parts: Alſo the great ſtoppage of the pores of the skin, doth hinder the empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or the parts: or great weakneſs of the natural heat, ſo that it can diſperſe none or but little of the ſubſtance of the Parts: or the calling of that heat to the concoction of the matter of a Diſeaſe wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the nouriſhment of Parts is neglected, as in Feavers.</p>
                     <p>The Second Cauſe is Natural Appetite, and the Attraction of nouriſhment to the ſtomach; and this is depraved when the Parts though empty, wil not draw by the veins, by reaſon they have loſt their ſtrength, but languiſh and forget their duty: As happeneth in acute, malignant, peſtilential, ſyntectick, and hectick Feavers: And in immoderate evacuations, as in Flux of the Liver, Womb, Haemorrhoids, Bleeding at the Noſe, Great Sweat, much Lechery, long Faſting, and the like.</p>
                     <p>The Third Cauſe is, The Attraction of the ſtomach by the Meſaraick Veins, which uſeth to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved by ſtoppage of thoſe veins, by which means the empty Parts cannot attract their Chylus, nor make the mouth of the ſtomach ſenſible: ſo we may perceive in Children troubled with Struma, to conſume by a long Flux of Chyle, by reaſon al the Meſentery is full of Glandles which ſtop its Veins, and hinder the paſſage of the Chyle to the Liver, by which means it is ſent half concocted forth by ſiege, and the Parts are deprived of their neceſſary nouriſhment.</p>
                     <p>The Fourth and Fifth Cauſes, which are Senſe of Sucking, and Animal Appetite, do require a good diſpoſition in the Stomach, brain, and nerves: Therefore whatſoever can al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>er their diſpoſitions may alſo deſtroy Appetite; ſo every great diſtemper of the belly, eſpecially if it be hot and dry doth hinder Appetite. Great heat by diſperſing the moiſt ſubſtance of the ſtomach, doth take away Appetite; as alſo great Cold not only poſitive as when the bowels are ſo cold that they are ſtupified by Air, Water, Froſt, Snow, and the like; but alſo privative, when the native heat is ſpent, which <hi>Galen</hi> cals Na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>coſis or Stupefaction, as by long bleeding, feavers, and the like, by which the ſtrength of the ſtomach and other Parts is conſumed. Evil alſo and corrupt Humors; whether hot or cold, do cauſe want of Appetite: The hot are chollerick, aduſt, putrid, or virulent, whether they are bred in the ſtomach for want of Concoction, or brought from other infirm Parts.</p>
                     <p>The Cold Humors are, Flegmy and Slimy, gathered in the ſtomach by evil Concoction, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from the whol body, as in them who by often Vomitings bring the corruption of other Parts into the ſtomach.</p>
                     <p>Or from the Brain by Catarrhs in which the ſtomalch uſeth to be troubled with Flegm: The ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Terms and Haemorrhoids alſo, by choaking and ſmoothering the natural heat do alſo diminiſh the Appetite.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, The diſtemper of the Brain and Nerves Cauſe that the Sucking is not flet in the ſtomach in them who have loſt or depraved the Animal Faculty; therefore they are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ick in mind, as in an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poplexy, Lethargy, Phrenzy, Madneſs, and the like; as alſo in a Palſie by reaſon of the Obſtruction
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:49088:111"/>
of the Nerve of the ſixth Conjugation which comes to the Stomach, or by reaſon of the ſtupefaction thereof, by the uſe of cold and narcotick things.</p>
                     <p>The knowledg of this Diſeaſe is manifeſt, for the Patient will complain of his want of appetite, and loathing of Meat. But the ſigns of the Cauſes are partly manifeſt, and partly to be diſcovered by art.</p>
                     <p>And firſt, they which cauſe the want of emptineſs, are known by former high feeding, repletion, want of exerciſe, or evacuation, long ſleep, and other Cauſes of crude Juyces; as alſo if the body be full, and the Veins ſwoln. Alſo the thickneſs of the Skin ſignifieth the ſame, for that hinders the diſperſing of the nouriſhment, as alſo ſome great diſeaſe in ſome particular part, by which there is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> diſperſing of the Natural heat in the whol Body, ſo that it is ſo weak that it cannot concoct the nouriſhment brought to the parts, and ſupply its wants.</p>
                     <p>The ſigns of the ſecond Cauſe are manifeſt, namely acute, malignant, peſtilential, and ſyntectick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Feavers, ſtrong evacuations, and other Cauſes, by which there is a great decay of Natural heat in the parts, ſo that they cannot attract neceſſary nouriſhment.</p>
                     <p>The ſigns of the third Cauſe are obſtructions, whoſe ſigns are known in the diſeaſes of the Liver, Spleen, and Meſentery.</p>
                     <p>The ſigns of the fourth and fifth Cauſe, need a more curious ſearch, and firſt heat in the Praecordia, eſpecially in the Stomach, thirſt, dryneſs, and bitterneſs of the Tongue and Jaws, and a Feaver, do ſignifie a hot diſtemper of the ſtomach, and abundance of Choller. And if this hot humor do flow from other parts, the diſeaſe of that part will ſhew it, as inflamation of the Liver, or other part. But if no other part ſeem to ſuffer, you muſt conjecture that the fault is in the Stomach, or that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil meats have been received. To theſe are joyned Cardialgia, Heart-ſcalding, Nauſea or loathing, Vomiting, and Purging, the Nature of which humors are known by what is ſent forth. A cold di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper and much flegm is known by cooling Cauſes afore going, or ſuch as diſperſe the Natural heat, and extinguiſh it; as alſo from the ſence of weight in the Stomach, from ſharp belching, or from a ſlimy thick humor ſent out of the mouth, or by ſtool.</p>
                     <p>The ſame is ſignified by a long Catarrh, and a diſeaſe in ſome part which may ſend flegm or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly to the Stomach, as of the Spleen, Womb, or the like. Alſo the diſtempers of the Brain and Nerves are to be known by their proper ſigns.</p>
                     <p>As to the Prognoſtick: As a good Appetite is good in all Diſeaſes; as <hi>Hipp.</hi> Aph. 33. Sect. 2. ſaies, To be right in mind, and to be willing to take that which is brought, is good: ſo want of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite uſeth to be an evil ſign. For it ſgnifieth a great digreſſion from the Natural ſtate; and it comes, as <hi>Galen</hi> teacheth, Com. in 3. Epid. either from evil Humors in the Mouth of the Stomach, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> from the loſs of the Faculty, whoſe duty it was to be ſenſible of the want of nouriſhment, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to deſire it. So <hi>Hipp.</hi> in 1 Epid. ſaith concerning men in Conſumptions that died in the time of an Epidemical diſeaſe, they alwaies abhorred meat and drink. And ſo <hi>Galen,</hi> Comment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in 3. Epid. ſaith that he hath ſeen many in a Plague time which could take no ſuſtenance, and died: But ſome who were ſtronger, and took courage, and did eat, recovered. So in <hi>Hipp.</hi> 3. Epid. Sect. 1. Aegr. 2. <hi>Hermocrates,</hi> who died the twenty ſeventh day, <hi>abhorred meat all the time, and in the laſt daies could not taſt.</hi> And Sect. 2. of the ſame Book, Aegr. 6. Euryanactis <hi>her daughter, abhorred meat all the while, and drank nothing worth ſpeaking of, died about twelve daies after.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But we muſt obſerve, that loathing of meat is ſad if it come from the deſtruction of the Natural heat: but it is not ſo dangerous if it come from abundance of evil humors, and Cacochymia; as you may ſee in <hi>Hipp.</hi> 7. Epid. by the Son of <hi>Cleomenis,</hi> who without a Feaver abhorred meat for two months, through abundance of crude and viſcid flegm, which he at laſt vomited up. So in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Diſeaſes, and eſpecially of Feavers, want of Appetite is not ſo dangerous, becauſe then Nature being buſie about the concocting of filthy humors, is called from her uſual deſire of meat. But after, when the Feaver is appeaſed, and the humors that cauſed the Diſeaſe being ſpent, ſhe returns to her old cuſtom.</p>
                     <p>In Children, want of Appetite is worſe than in others, becauſe their ſubſtance is moiſt, and eaſily diſſipated, and requires more uſe of nouriſhment to reſtore them.</p>
                     <p>In men recovered of a Diſeaſe, loathing threateneth a relapſe, by reaſon the reliques of the Diſeaſe cauſe it.</p>
                     <p>In a continual Diſeaſe, loathing and ſincere dejections are evil. <hi>Hipp.</hi> Aph. 6. Sect. 7. loathing is an evil ſign in long diſeaſes: but they who are like to eſcape, have the contrary; that is, a good appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite. But ſincere dejections coming, do cauſe a worſe Prognoſtick; becauſe <hi>Hippocrates</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands by ſincere dejections, ſuch as have no humidity mixed with them, when the humor alone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Water, is caſt forth, whether Choller or Melancholly; for theſe ſtools do ſhew that all the Natural humidity is burnt up by the heat of the Feaver.</p>
                     <p>In long Diſeaſes of the Guts, loathing of meat is evil, and with a Feaver worſe; <hi>Hipp.</hi> Aph. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sect. 6. when there are deep and putrid Ulcers in a dyſentery, the Stomach ſuffering with the Guts</p>

There are ſome in Dyſenteries, who abhor meat from the beginning of the Diſeaſe, by reaſon of the wil humors which come from the Liver; for the ſuperfluous part of them comes to the mouth of the Stomach, which is not alwaies dangerous. But in long Diſeaſes when it is ſo, there is either a putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <p>The Cure of this Diſeaſe, if it come from the diſtemper of other parts, muſt be by the Cure of it. But if it come only from a fault in the Stomach, it is to be reduced to a hot or cold diſtemper joyned with matter.</p>
                     <p>A hot diſtemper is to be cured firſt by purging of Choller gently and often. And this may be made of Rhubarb, Myrobalans, Tamarinds, Syrup of Roſes, or of Succory with Rhubarb; Or if the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <p>The ſame Humor is to be altered with Juleps or cooling Broths, in which you muſt not omit the Spirit of Vitriol or Sulphur; becauſe all ſharp things do not only allay Choller, but provoke an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <p>Or you may alter and purge this Humor at once with a convenient Apozeme, to which, for the Stomach, ad half a handful of Sea Wormwood, and half an ounce of Citron Myrobalans.</p>
                     <p>After Purging, Marmalad of Quinces is good to ſtrengthen the Stomach; or the Syrup mixed with Syrup of Wormwood, the Lozenges of Diamargariton frigid, or Triaſantalon, or Diarrhodon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>A loathing cometh from a cold diſtemper, when flegmy melanchollick humors are gathered into the Stomach, and hinder its office; or being drawn from all other parts of the Body, as in them who uſing to vomit, draw the impurity of other parts to the Stomach, or from the Brain, Spleen, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and other parts.</p>
                     <p>In the Cure hereof, you muſt firſt look at the diſtemper of the parts from whence they come, which muſt be amended with Remedies laid down in their proper Chapters.</p>
                     <p>Then you muſt apply Medicines to the Stomach by Evacuation of the Humor offending, and ſtrengthening the parts.</p>
                     <p>Evacuation may be made by vomit or ſtool.</p>

                     <p>Take of <hi>Syrup of Wormwood, one ounce: Let him Drink it Faſting many mornings: or Wormwood-wine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Conſerve of Mints, Citron peels candied, and candied Mutmegs, of each half an ounce: one candied Myrobalane: of Confectio Alkermes, three drams: the inward skins of Hens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maws poudered, two drams: Cinnamon and Aromaticum Roſatum, of each one dram: with ſyrup of Mints make an Opiate: or candy them with ſugar of Roſes; uſe it in the morning, drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king after it a little Wine.</hi>

                     <p>Or, Salt of Wormwood with Orange peels, or either of them to half a dram in Wine, or Broth.</p>
                     <p>This following Syrup is moſt excellent:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the ſyrup of Quinces, and Citron Barks candied, of each two ounces: Cinnamon wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, one ounce: Oyl of Sulphur twelve drops: mix them to be taken now and then a ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Clarret Water is uſual, and it is made thus:</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>In <hi>Paris</hi> the Syrup of Wormwood made by <hi>Pena</hi> is highly eſteemed; made thus,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>half a pound of candied Citron barks ſliced: boyl them in equal parts of the Waters of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cory and Agrimony, make a ſtrong expreſſion and put to it the juyce of Quinces, and Wormwood water, of each half a pint; in which infuſe for four dayes four ounces of Schoenanth in a cloſe veſſel well glaſſed and ſet upon the Embers; diſſolve in the ſtraining as much ſugar as is needful; then boyl them to a ſyrup, in which when it is hot diſſolve one dram of aſh-coloured Amber: keep it in a cloſe Glaſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Cinnamon Water alone is excellent good in a Cold Stomach, or with other Medicines, as Syrup of Wormwood, Mints, or Coral; to which you may alſo put Amber-greece.</p>

                     <p>The Elixir Proprietatis, deſcribed by <hi>Crollius,</hi> is good, if you give twelve or fifteen drops in Wine they wonderfully ſtrengthen the Stomach.</p>
                     <p>You may make Tablets for the ſame purpoſe thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the pulp of Rinds of freſh Oranges, and Aromaticum Roſatum, of each two drams: white Sugar diſſolved in Orange flower water four ounces. Make Lozenges.</hi>

                        <hi>Chap. 2.</hi> Of Dogs Appetite, called <hi>Fames canina.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>HAving in the former Chapter ſpoken of Appetite diminiſhed and aboliſhed, now we ſhall ſpeak of it depraved. And this is done two waies: When it either offendeth in quantity or quality. It offends in quantity when nouriſhment is required in a greater quantity than Nature would; and this is called <hi>Boulimia,</hi> or Dogs Appetite: It offends in quality when things are required which are evil, or are not food, and this is called <hi>Pica</hi> or <hi>Kitta.</hi> Of the firſt we ſhall ſpeak in this Chapter, of the laſt in the Chapter following.</p>
                     <p>The word <hi>Boulimia</hi> comes <hi>apo tou bou kai limou,</hi> becauſe the Particle <hi>Bou</hi> put to other words, encreaſe the ſignification, as if it were compared to the greatneſs of an Ox. It is alſo called <hi>Phagedaina,</hi> which word is given to Ulcers which eat the fleſh and enlarge, and therefore called <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcera Phagedaina,</hi> that is, ſpreading Ulcers. Now it is called <hi>Fames Canina,</hi> or Dogs Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, becauſe they who have it are hungry as Dogs.</p>
                     <p>But you may obſerve that theſe two words, <hi>Boulimia,</hi> and <hi>Fames Canina,</hi> are ſomtimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, and uſed for the ſame thing: and ſomtimes diſtinguiſhed, ſo that it is called <hi>Fames Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nina,</hi> when after much feeding they vomit like Dogs. But ſome purge rather than vomit, when Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture throweth down that which it cannot concoct. In <hi>Boulimia,</hi> vomit doth not follow, but ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Lipothymia. There are ſome who feed unſatiably, and yet vomit not, nor purge, but concoct all, and if they have not preſently more, are ſick. As <hi>Sennertus</hi> reports of a Scholler, who was black colored, who eat not only in the day, but night, and digeſted it without vomiting; he could not be ſatisfied with delicate meats, but required groſs, and therefore would eat no Bakers Bread, but ſuch as the Country people made, and would eat as many raw Parſnips in a Summer morning as could be bought for ſix pence, without damage.</p>
                     <p>Hence it appears that this diſeaſe is a Symptome of an action depraved, in reſpect of quantity, which action being encreaſed, is called Dog-like, or an Appetite beyond Natural Meaſure. The part affected is chiefly the mouth of the Stomach. The cauſe containing, is ſence of ſucking, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement pulling, which ſtirs up the Appetite.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Galen</hi> 2. de ſymp. cauſ. cap. 7. reduceth the immediate cauſes of this Diſeaſe to two Heads, in theſe words: <hi>Evil Appetites exceeding in quantity, which are called by ſome Caninae, are then, when either ſome evil ſharp Juyce biteth the Stomach, or when the whol Body immoderately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocting, wants nouriſhment; for evil Juyce which is cold, biteth like the Natural ſucking, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth appetite by the reſemblance of Nature.</hi> The immediate cauſe of a preternatural Appetite, according to <hi>Galen,</hi> is firſt a vicious humor, and cold, ſticking to the Stomach: Secondly, want of Food by over much concoction.</p>
                     <p>Evil Humors ſticking to the Stomach, cauſe immoderate Appetite, becauſe they by their too much coldneſs, ſharpneſs, and ſowrneſs, do conſtringe, wrinkle, and pull the mouth of the Stomach, and ſo make a ſence of feeling like a natural ſucking, and beget a falſe Appetite.</p>
                     <p>This Humor is either ſowr flegm ſtaying long in the Stomach, or many times Melancholly ſent from the Spleen into the Stomach, which in a natural ſtate, and a moderate quantity and quality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets a moderate and natural Appetite; but if it be preternatural and exceed, it makes the Appetite too great.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="255" facs="tcp:49088:114"/>The want of Food, by reaſon whereof the Veins do continually ſuck from the Stomach, either it comes from too great Evacuation by bleeding, purging, vomiting, ſweating, and the like, or from too great a Conſumption of the alimentary ſubſtance, by reaſon of the immoderate heat of the parts, or the thinneſs of the humors, and body, and looſneſs of the pores, watchings, baths, immoderate exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, much venery; all which do diſſolve the ſubſtance, making humidity; and by theſe emptineſs being cauſed, and want of food, the meat is carried from the Stomach ſooner than it ought.</p>
                     <p>Alſo this <hi>Fames Canina,</hi> or Dogs Appetite, may come from Worms which devour the Chylus; as <hi>Trallianus</hi> reports, <hi>lib. 7. cap.</hi> 4. of a Woman in this Diſeaſe, which voided a worm twelve <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ubits long by the uſe of Hiera, and was cured.</p>
                     <p>The Hermetical Phyſitians do lay down another cauſe of this wonderful Appetite, namely, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain diſſolving Spirit begot in the Body, which by an inhaerent property doth ſo readily conſume whatſoever meat is taken, ſo that it doth not allow Nature a lawful and neceſſary bound of nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This they call a hungery devouring, ſalt, ſharp, vitriol Spirit. For ſay they, as from divers Salts, Vitriol, Niter, common Salt, and Salt Armoniack, with the like, Aqua fortis is made by Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry, which will diſſolve the hardeſt Stones, Mettals, into Liquor in a ſhort time; ſo that Gold which will not be diſſolved in a month by a ſtrong fire, in a quarter of an hour will be diſſolved in <hi>Aqua regia,</hi> and be turned into a Liquor of the ſame color.</p>
                     <p>This Doctrine is diligently to be examined; for as the digeſtion of the Stomach in its Natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition hath ſomthing to be admired by the curious Searchers into Nature; ſo the ſame being made preternatural hath ſomthing to be wondered at.</p>
                     <p>This is wonderful in the Natural digeſtion of the Belly, that the hardeſt meats are digeſted therein, and in three or four hours ſpace are turned into a Chylous Liquor, ſo thin that it may be ſtrained through the narroweſt branches of the Venae lacteae; and that Dogs do turn the hardeſt bones into the ſame Liquor, is not to be attributed to a ſtronger concocting heat, becauſe meat in a pot, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the fire be never ſo hot, cannot in twenty four hours, or many daies be converted into the ſame. The Galeniſts hold that this comes from the faculty of the Stomach, which faculty works not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Inſtrument, becauſe if there is an <hi>Idioſyncraſia,</hi> or a certain proportion of the firſt qualities, as is commonly reported, its chief action muſt be from heat; for cold, moiſture, or drineſs, do nothing to that great diſſolving of food, and heat, as it is ſaid, hath not that power. Therefore the Idioſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſia is ſomwhat more unknown, and not to be expreſſed. Let us therefore ſearch after it in the Macrocoſm or grater World, of which there is a great Analogy or reſemblance in the little World. And therefore the more witty Hermets ſay that there is a certain Spirit or acide Liquor ſent from the Spleen into the Stomach, which diſſolveth the ſolid nouriſhment, and ſhortly converteth it into Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Liquor, and that is the principal Inſtrument of digeſtion. And ſome conjecture that this may be made, becauſe Birds who digeſt the hardeſt nouriſhment have a Spleen round about their Maw; for the fleſh which is found about their Stomachs is like the ſubſtance of a Spleen; from whence there is a more noble uſe of the Spleen than what is allowed by the Ancients, who ſaid that it was only for the purging of the groſſer ſort of Blood; becauſe according to this opinion it ſerveth for concoction of meat. Therefore if the Spirit or ſharp Liquor which comes from the Spleen when it is in its Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral condition, makes a natural and moderate digeſtion; the ſame ſpirit being altered from its natural condition and defiled, or made ſharper or more diſſolving, it will ſooner diſſolve ſolid nouriſhment; and when they are ſo diſſolved and thrown from the Stomach, it will make a new immoderate Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite. We do not conclude that this new Doctrine is certain and undoubted, but we only ſhew it that ſolid wits may examine it. And we will talk of it again when we ſpeak of the cauſes of the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance of Concoction.</p>
                     <p>The ſigns by which this diſeaſe is known are manifeſt; for it will appear to them that eat, and to the ſtanders by, that the Appetite is depraved which cauſeth ſuch devouring of meat, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards is thrown up by vomit, and then it is Fames Canina, and if Vomits follow not, then there is fainting, with coldneſs of the extream parts, and this is called <hi>Boulimia.</hi>

                     <p>The ſigns of the Cauſes may be found by the Antecedents, Concomitants, and Conſequents. Theſe are the ſigns of a cold diſtemper, and of ſharp humors in the Stomach, belching, and ſharp vomiting, crude dejections, or ſtools, want of thirſt, and external Cauſes of refrigeration afore going. If it come from defect of Nouriſhment, the Patient is lean, and there are cauſes preſent or fore-going of the diſſolving of the Humidity; and laſtly, the ſigns of Worms ſhall be ſpoken of in their proper Chapter.</p>
                     <p>The Prognoſtick of this Diſeaſe, is thus: If it come only from External Cauſes it is not dangerous if they be preſently taken away: And if it come of Worms there is little danger, for when they are taken away the Diſeaſe is cured.</p>
                     <p>But it is very dangerous if it follow great Evacuations and meltings of the body; eſpecially if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter meat when the belly is yet ful there come a fainting; for when that which ſhould moſt help, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes unprofitable, it ſignifies a great diſtemper of the Stomach.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="256" facs="tcp:49088:115"/>So a Dog Appetite continuing with Vomiting and great Purging is dangerous, for it uſeth to end in an evil habit, dropſie, lethargy, conſumption and the like.</p>
                     <p>As for the Cure, becauſe Fames Canina for the moſt part takes its Original from Melanchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and Flegmatick Humors faſtened in the Mouth of the Stomach; therefore Medicines muſt principally be directed to them; ſuch as do empty and change the Humors and alſo ſtrengthen the part affected.</p>
                     <p>You muſt Evacuate by Vomit or Stool with Medicines Preſcribed in the Cure of Want of Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite from a Cold Cauſe; for although theſe Diſeaſes are contrary, yet come they from the ſame Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, different in the degrees of Coldneſs, and ſecond Qualities, and ſuch as diverſly affect the Stomach.</p>
                     <p>Alſo the Remedies there Preſcribed to heat the Stomach and ſtrengthen it both internally and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally are excellent, becauſe they not only correct the Cold Diſtemper, but dry and cauſe thirſt; and thirſt coming, hunger is diminiſhed.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, Wine plentifully taken aſſwageth hunger, according to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> Aph. 21. Sect. 2 And eſpecially the Spirit of Wine, or Aqua Vitae.</p>
                     <p>They do properly ſtay Hunger which do much moiſten the Stomach, relax it, and aſſwage the ſharpneſs of humors. As al Fat things and Oyls, as <hi>Villanovanus</hi> reports, That one thus diſeaſed did eat a hot Loaf dipp'd in Oyl; and a Woman drank the melted Sewet of an Ox with as much warm Oyl at Twice, and both did ſo Diſdain Meat, That they eat nothing in Five Dayes, and were Cured.</p>
                     <p>Narcotick Medicines by Dulling the too exquiſite ſenſe of the Stomach, do leſſen this Diſeaſe; and new Treacle is moſt uſual for it becauſe beſides its ſtupifying quality it doth correct the malignity of the Humors which is ſome cauſe thereof.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe theſe are to be uſed but ſeldom and not without urgent neceſſity, ſomtimes you may uſe old Treacle, for the reaſon aforeſaid, as alſo to ſtrengthen.</p>
                     <p>Five or Six Grains of Amber-greece taken in a rear Eg doth not only ſtrengthen the Stomach, but by a ſpecial quality cureth this Diſeaſe.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>PIca</hi> and <hi>Malacia,</hi> are a depraved Appetite; by which, evil, unprofitable, and hurtful things are deſired.</p>
                     <p>It is called <hi>Kitta</hi> or Pica from the bird called a Pye, either in regard of the variety of colours, or becauſe it eateth lumps of Earth, for Women in this Diſeaſe uſe to eat Earth and Chalk, and the like: It is called Malacia by <hi>Pliny,</hi> for theſe Women through Weakneſs of mind, and tenderneſs, want that right and natural Appetite.</p>
                     <p>This Diſeaſe comes of evil corrupt Humors, which are gathered into the Stomach by reaſon of its hurt Concoction, or elſe ſent from other parts.</p>
                     <p>Flegmatick and Melanchollick People are moſt diſpoſed for the production of theſe Humors, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially Women, to whom this Diſeaſe ſeems proper and peculiar; although ſomtimes Boyes and Men, though ſeldom have the ſame: Eating of evil Diet doth cauſe this, want of any natural Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation, eſpecially of the Terms, Sadneſs, Diſtemper of the Liver and Spleen, Obſtructions and Weakneſs, divers diſeaſes of the Womb, and the like.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Vitious Humors according to the divers degrees of diſtempers and other diſpoſitions have a diverſe nature, from whence come divers appetites of evil things: For ſince ſom Humors are crude and inconcocted, others burnt, and aduſt; ſome require ſowr things, ſharp, bitter, and very cold, ſo that they are delighted with the continual uſe of unripe Fruits, Vinegar, Juyce of Lemons, Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granats, and Orenges, cold Water, Snow, Ice, and the like. Others deſire Earthy, Dry, and Burnt things, as Gloves, Cinnamon, Nutmegs, and other Spices, Salt-Aſhes, Chalk, and the like.</p>
                     <p>This Diſeaſe is Common to Women in the Chloroſis, or Green-ſickneſs; to Women great with Child; and ſuch as have their Terms ſtopped; which ſtaying in the Body corrupt, and aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding do infect the Stomach, from whence its Actions are depraved, and chiefly the Appetite is taken from its natural Condition.</p>
                     <p>Boyes are ſomtimes troubled herewith, and eſpecially if they are born of a Woman that hath the Chloroſis: Nor are men altogether free from it, although it happen ſeldom; and they are e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>It is Diſputed much among Authors, Whether a Depraved Appetite require thoſe Things which are like to the Preternatural<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> State or Diſtemper of the Stomach, or thoſe that are Contrary? <hi>Galen</hi>
                        <pb n="257" facs="tcp:49088:115"/>
raiſed the firſt Diſpute, <hi>cap. 3. artis parvae,</hi> where he teacheth, <hi>That the Stomach being diſtempered, doth deſire Contraries, and in its natural ſtate and temper it deſireth things like to its ſelf.</hi> Which Doctrine <hi>Avicen</hi> following, <hi>Fen. 13. lib. 3. tract. 2. cap.</hi> 10. ſpeaks thus, <hi>When there is an evil Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor gathered in the ſtomach, different in quality from its own nature, then it doth require things contrary to it; therefore ſome deſire Clay, Coals, Earth, Loam, Chalk and the like, by reaſon of the quality that is in them, to dry up and cut that which is contrary to the quality of the Humors:</hi> But they who are in health deſire judicially rather things like, than contraries; for ſince fancy is much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in ſtirring up of Appetite, and is much ſtirred up from the diſpoſition of the body, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that the humor predominating ſhould move the fancy to deſire things like unto it; For as chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick men both in time of health and ſickneſs, do dream of Fire and Anger: and Flegmatick men of Snow, Ice, and Waters: the Apprehenſion of which things proceeds from the Humors predomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the body: So when the ſeat of Appetite the mouth of the Stomach is affected by foul humors there long con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>inuing, they do imprint their ſimilitudes in the Fancy which ſtirs up the Appetite to deſire things like it though never ſo contrary to reaſon, which is now overcome by the force of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, If things contrary to the diſeaſe or its cauſe were deſired by the continual uſe thereof, the diſeaſe would be cured; daily experience confirmeth this.</p>
                     <p>By which we are taught, That Virgins in the Green-ſickneſs, and Women with Child, do for the moſt part deſire thoſe things which are agreeable to their preſent Diſtemper and evil Habit, ſo that they who have Salt and Aduſt Humors long for Coals, Salt, Spices, and the like: but they who have Melancholly or Salt Flegm predominating, deſire Vinegar, green Fruits, and the like.</p>
                     <p>As for the Authority of <hi>Galen,</hi> ſome wholly reject it; ſaying, That if it were true, That Diſeaſed Diſpoſitions ſhould deſire their Contraries, al ſick men, of evil Habit, would deſire Meat of good nouriſhment; which is not true, for we often ſee that ſick men deſire evil meats, and refuſe good: and we ſee that bodies inflamed, whether they are in a preternatural ſtate, as in Feavers; or in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, as by violent exerciſe, require cooling.</p>
                     <p>Some deſire to Reconcile this Opinion of <hi>Galens,</hi> ſaying, That in this Pica the diſtemper upon the Stomach is habitual and connatural, and therefore doth cauſe an Appetite like to a natural, which is for things like it; which may be thus explained, When we ſay that every natural temper doth require the like, and every preternatural the contrary; the laſt is to be underſtood of diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers which come without overflowing moiſture; for they which are with much moiſture when it is ſucked up by the tunicles of the Stomach, do rather deſire things like the moiſture with which they are wet, becauſe the Humor which now pierceth al the Tunicles although it be noxious, yet it is not troubleſome: On the contrary, when the humor only poſſeſſeth part only of the Stomach, or is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the bottom, the Stomach deſires the contrary to that which is offenſive unto it; but if it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the whol Stomach, and be ſoaked into its Tunicles, then the natural Faculty is deſtroyed and ſo changed, that it doth not deſire any thing but what is like to the Humor ſo ſoaked in, and ſo it may be rightly ſaid that the humors was become as it were connatural.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Platerus</hi> and <hi>Sennertus</hi> do eaſily free themſelves from theſe difficulties, by flying to an occult qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and they take occaſion from hence, if the Patients ſo affected ſhould require things like to the cauſe of the diſeaſe, then by the plentiful uſe of them the diſeaſe would be exceedingly encreaſed, but we ſee that they wil devour Chalk, Clay, Coals, and the like traſh, and receive not the leaſt hurt thereby, by which men that are ſound would be almoſt killed.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, They ſay that Women with Child wil often void ſalt and ſowr humors, and yet not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſalt or ſowr things, but the contrary. And laſtly they affirm conſtantly that there is no agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Coals, Chalk, raw Fleſh, and the like with the Humors. And therefore they ſay that they muſt not reſt in manifeſt qualities, and that the Cauſe of this Symptome and wonderful Appetite cannot be taken from them, but they muſt fly to ſome occult quality not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</p>
                     <p>Yet <hi>Sennertus</hi> confeſſeth that it is probable that this Appetite depraved, ſhould proceed rather from a like than a contrary quality: but what that quality is cannot be explained, becauſe the things which are deſired have no agreement with the humors either ſweet, ſalt, or ſowr in manifeſt qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</p>
                     <p>We may Reconcile al theſe thus:</p>
                     <p>The deſire of Traſh is ſtirred up by humors of the like nature and temper, but theſe humors beſides their native temper have a certain peculiar fault from corruption, which ſince it cannot be wel explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it may be called an Occult Quality.</p>
                     <p>The Knowledg of this Diſeaſe is eaſie, for the Patient can relate it; it is manifeſt that the part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected is the mouth of the Stomach, for that is the Seat of Appetite. The Cauſe alſo may be found out by conjecture from the ſuppoſed deſire of things like. For if they deſire Coals, Salt, and the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:49088:116"/>
like, we may gather that the diſeaſe depends upon Salt and burnt humors, which will more cleerly appear, if any of thoſe Humors be caſt forth by vomit or ſtool, if there be ſharp belchings, or ſalt, a taſt bitter, ſowr, or ſalt.</p>
                     <p>As to the Prognoſtick; This Diſeaſe is Chronical, of continuance, but not very dangerous, if the Body by Nature or Art may be brought to its old condition, which is not very difficult. For in time the Humor offending may be ſent forth by vomiting naturally, or by Medicines: and the Terms or Haemorrhoids ſtopt, which cauſed this diſeaſe firſt, may in time be diſcharged; which if neglected, and Nature ſinks under the burden, great diſeaſes follow: For when the firſt Concoction is hurt, it is neceſſary that the ſecond and third be corrupted, from whence come great Obſtructions, evil ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, and dropſies. Or if the Humor be carried in greater plenty to the Stomach, and partake of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Malignity, ſomtimes it produceth violent Cardialgiaes, or Heart diſeaſes; from whence fainting, ſwooning, and ſomtimes death doth follow.</p>
                     <p>If Women in this diſeaſe begin to abſtain from traſh, and to eat good meat with leſs diſdain, it is a moſt certain ſign of health at hand.</p>
                     <p>Women with Child uſe to be freed of this diſeaſe about the fourth month, becauſe then the Child is grown greater, and ſo conſumeth more of the humors, and the mother hath ſent it forth by often vomitings; but if it laſt longer, 'tis dangerous; for it ſignifies that the evil diſpoſition of the Stomach hath taken deep root, which will hardly be pluckt up.</p>
                     <p>It is better for people in this diſeaſe to deſire ſharp and ſowr things; it is worſe if they deſire things contrary to Nature, as <hi>Avicen</hi> teacheth, <hi>fen. 13. lib. 2. tract. 2. cap.</hi> 20. for it ſignifies a greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Natural ſtate, which is harder to be cured.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of this diſeaſe is divers, according to the variety of the Bodies affected.</p>
                     <p>In Women with Child, few Medicines are to be uſed, by reaſon of the unfitneſs of the ſubject, and danger of Miſearriage, but you may give them gentle things, and ſuch as were preſcribed in the Cure of want of Appetite to clenſe and ſtrengthen the Stomach. Nor muſt you omit blood-letting, which done ſparingly and often, is of great conſequence.</p>
                     <p>But in Virgins of the <hi>Cloroſis,</hi> or green ſickneſs, this diſeaſe is cured with the ſame Remedies, which ſhall be preſcribed for the Cure of Cloroſis in its proper place.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Pica</hi> which is in men, is very ſeldom, becauſe it comes from obſtructions of the Liver and Spleen, you may uſe thoſe things which ſhall be preſcribed for the Cure of them.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THe Appetite of Drink, or Thirſt, may be three waies hurt, as that of Meat, by diminiſhing, abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing, and depraving; it is diminiſhed many times by a ſweet inſipid humor, which moiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Tunicle of the Stomach, or from too much moiſture in the whol Body, from whence it is that the parts do not draw the drink from the Stomach. It is aboliſhed by acute Diſeaſes through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terception of the ſence, when the mind is ſick, or becauſe the Natural Faculty is decayed by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of the Natural heat; from whence <hi>Hipp.</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is evil not to thirſt, when a cauſe of thirſt is taken:</hi> and ſince thirſt diminiſhed doth depend upon the ſame cauſe, from which want of Appetite is produced, and thirſt aboliſhed, is only in acute Diſeaſes, we ſhall not ſpeak here of them particularly. But we will only ſpeak of thirſt depraved, as being moſt uſual: and this is to be divided two waies, and Hunger. The one requiring divers kinds of Drinks; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great quantities, and often. That which deſireth filthy drink is to be referred to Pica, as when they deſire Vinegar, Lemmons, and ſalt Water. It remains that we ſpeak of thirſt encreaſed, which is an uſual Symptome when the Appetite offends in the quantity of Liquor, and much drink is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired.</p>
                     <p>The immediate Cauſe is a want of moiſt nouriſhment, and drineſs of the Stomach, and of other parts which make the Stomach ſenſible of their wants.</p>
                     <p>This drineſs and want of moiſture, uſeth to come from all ſuch things which can conſume the dewy moiſture of the Stomach and the whol Body, and dry it up, and they are hot and dry. The dry do principally ſuck up the Humor, and the hot things ſecondarily.</p>
                     <p>Alſo this diſeaſe is either by Propriety, or by Sympathy. It is by Propriety when the innate moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of the Stomach is altered and drawn forth by an unequal diſtemper, dry or hot, or both; ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by a ſimple diſtemper, but often by that diſtemper which is joyned with matter; as a ſalt, ſharp, or filthy humor fixed in the mouth of the Stomach, or contained in its Cavity. But that which is by Sympathy, comes by conſent from the whol Body, or ſome part whoſe Veins having loſt their moiſture, do ſuck from the Stomach; as it is in Feavers, Inflamations of the Liver, Lungs, and other parts, as alſo in hot and dry diſtempers, eſpecially of the Reins, as you may ſee in a Diabetes, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiuntary
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:49088:116"/>
piſſing, which is called by the name of <hi>Dipſacus,</hi> by reaſon of the great thirſt which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panieth it.</p>
                     <p>The outward Cauſes are all ſuch as extraordinarily heat or dry, as very hot and dry Air, long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in the Sun, or at the fire, uſe of Salt meats, ſharp, and ſpiced, much uſe of old rich Wine, great watchings, too much evacuation, eſpecially by purging.</p>
                     <p>The Hermetical Phyſitians ſay, that immoderate preternatural thirſt comes from ſome thirſty ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits which are bred of Sulphureous excrements, which will not be ſatisfied with ſimple cooling and moiſtening, but with other Spirits like unto themſelves; as we ſee in Feavers that a ſtrong thirſt is little allayed with much Water, which with ſharp Spirits of Vitriol, Sulphur, Salt, and the like, wil be ſatisfied with a leſs quantity of Water.</p>
                     <p>The knowledg is eaſie, for the Patients will complain. But the Cauſes are known by their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſigns; as a hot and dry diſtemper cleaving to the Stomach and other parts; as alſo ſharp, ſalt, and bitter humors, ſome whereof are ſomtimes caſt forth, or they have their taſts in their mouths, if the humors are in the Stomach; but if thirſt come by conſent from other parts, the ſigns of thoſe Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes will be manifeſt.</p>
                     <p>As to the Prognoſtick: That thirſt which comes from Primary Cauſes is ſafeſt, for that is quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched preſently with drink. But that which comes from internal Cauſes, is more or leſs dangerous, according to their differences.</p>
                     <p>That thirſt which comes with Feavers, and other eaſie cures, endeth with them. But if it come from great and dangerous Diſeaſes, it is very dangerous; as in a Dropſie in which thirſt is not ſlacked, but rather encreaſed with drink.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of this Diſeaſe is often in Feavers, and Inflamations of ſome parts; which is deſcribed ſufficiently in our Method of the Cure of Feavers, Sect. 2. Cap. 2.</p>
                     <p>But if Thirſt be contracted by immoderate Evacuations cauſing a dry diſtemper of the Stomach, and other Cauſes, the Cure is by ſuppreſſing thoſe Evacuations, and by reſtoring the empty parts with moiſt Medicines.</p>
                     <p>Therefore firſt, having ordered a reſtoring Diet, as in a Hectick Feaver, Conſumption, and Maraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus. Two Remedies preſcribed by <hi>Galen</hi> are the beſt, 7. meth. namely, Milk and Baths. Although <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> Aph. 64. Sect. 5. forbids milk to thirſty people, that is to be underſtood of thoſe who thirſt from abundance of Choller, and putrid Humors, in whom Milk is eaſily putrified; not of thoſe who thirſt from drineſs and Conſumption. We ſhewed the uſe of Milk in the Cure of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</p>
                     <p>Let the Bath be made of the Decoction of Althaea Roots, and Lilly Roots, with Mallows, and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let Leaves, and of a Decoction of the Heads, Feet, and Guts of Sheep, or melt freſh Butter, or Oyl in warm Water, to be changed often.</p>
                     <p>Going out of the Bath, let the Loyns, Back, and Stomach be anointed with Oyl of Violets, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of a Veal Bone, and the like, with which let as much Breaſt, or Goats Milk be mingled, as they will receive.</p>
                     <p>Let the Patient in the mean while uſe reſtoring Syrups and Lozenges, and other Remedies which ſhall be laid down in the Cure of an Hectick Feaver.</p>
                     <p>This following Opiate is excellent:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Eryngus Roots candied, and Conſerve of Bugloſs, of each two ounces: Conſerve of Violets and Borrage flowers, of each one ounce: Confectio Alkermes half an ounce: Diapene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dion newly prepared without the Species, two drams: with Syrup of ſweet Apples make an Opiate, of which let him take the quantity of a Cheſnut at the time of thirſt, drinking after it a little Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage Water.</hi>

The nidorous Crudity is when the nouriſhment is turned into a ſtinking, burnt matter, as when the ſtink of Eggs, or rotten fiſh, or fryed Oyl, is ſmelt by belching, which happens often in hot Chollerick Bodies. But a ſharp ſowr Crudity is when meat turns ſowr, and the belchings are ſowr, and this comes from a cold diſtemper. To theſe you may ad a third difference of Crudities, when by reaſon of weak heat the matter is imperfectly concocted, and is turned into flegm without ſowr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="260" facs="tcp:49088:117"/>The Cauſes that hinder Concoction in the Stomach may be brought into three Heads, namely, a fault in the Organ, Object, and things External and Internal.</p>
                     <p>The fault in the Organ comprehendeth all diſeaſes in the Stomach, whether they be Similar, or Organ cal, or Common, all which may overthrow its actions, but diſtemper is commonly the cauſe of hurt Concoction; for ſince Concoction is made by a moderate heat according to Nature, if at any time it want its due moderation, the Concoction is hurt. So a cold diſtemper of the Stomach which diminiſheth the Heat, if it be gentle it only weakeneth the Concoction, and make a Brylypepſia, or ſlow Concoction. If the cold diſtemper be greater, it aboliſheth Concoction, and makes Apepſia. But a hot diſtemper doth deprave Concoction, and make a Dyſpepſia, which is a difficult Concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Theſe diſtempers are ſomtimes ſimple, and in ſuch who have Naturally a weak Stomach, and ſmal Natural heat; or have a ſharp and burning heat, but they are commonly with matter: hence in Hypochondriack Melancholly, much flegm and fermentation of a black Humor uſe to cauſe Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, Winds, Swellings, Rumblings, and ſowr Belchings.</p>
                     <p>The fault of the Object, that is, the nouriſhment which is the proper Object of the Stomach, comes many waies, when it offendeth in Subſtance, Quantity, Quality, time, or Order of being taken.</p>
                     <p>Nouriſhment is vitious in reſpect of its ſubſtance, when it is too hard and difficult to be concocted, as Deers fleſh, Hairs fleſh, eſpecially if old, and made hard with Salt or Smoak, Bread full of Bran, Muſhroms, Roots, Pulſe, and the like, which are called Dyſpepta.</p>
                     <p>Meats offend in Quantity when too much is taken at once, and therefore cannot be overcome by the heat, hence come Crudities, which are moſt uſual among them who do ſurfet themſelves. If there be leſs eaten than is required, it may ſeem to be crude, becauſe too little meat will be burnt and dryed in a Chollerick Stomach.</p>
                     <p>Meats offend in Quality which are too cold and moiſt, and windy, or they which are too hot, whereby the thinner part of the Chyle is burnt, and turned into nidorous vapors.</p>
                     <p>To this may be reduced the Art of Cookery, and Sawce-making; for the divers waies of roaſting, boyling, and making of Sawce, do alter the diſpoſition of Meat, by which means they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more eaſie or hard of Concoction.</p>
                     <p>The time and order of eating being prepoſterous, may alſo ſpoil the Concoction, as if any one ſhould omit his uſual time of eating, and fall to at midnight, or a little before he goes to ſleep, fill his Stomach; or if after taking of ſolid and aſtringing things, as Cheeſe, Pears, Quinces, and the like, they take liquid things which do ſoon corrupt.</p>
                     <p>Alſo external things may ſpoil the Concoction, if they be immoderate: ſo too cold Air by dulling the natural near, if it be weak or too hot, by diſſipating the heat may hinder Concoction; as alſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate exerciſe, eſpecially after meat, by drawing the natural heat forth from the Stomach to the external parts, and ſo diſperſing it extraordinarily; as alſo by throwing the Chylus yet imperfect into the Guts. The ſtoppage of the Belly and other excrements, or an immoderate flux, great wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings, ſleep in the day time, great paſſions of the mind, eſpecialy ſadneſs, and deep ſtudy preſently after meat, and the like, do not a little hinder the action of the Stomach.</p>
                     <p>Beſides the Cauſes mentioned, the Hermeticks of late time mention one leſs uſual, and not noted by the Ancients, which alſo is not plainly demonſtrated by them; but it is confirmed by ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, not to be contemned; of which we made mention in the explaining of the Cauſes of Fames Canina. Firſt therefore they aſhrm that the Natural Concoction of the Stomach is not made by heat only; but that quick melting of ſolid meats by which it is converted into Chylus, is from another cauſe; ſince Experience teacheth that meat boyling in a pot at a ſtrong fire many daies, will never be diſſolved: and bones in a Dogs Stomach are quickly diſſolved, and turned into Chylous Liquor; and in the bellies of Fiſhes which have no actual heat, all that is brought in is diſſolved and concocted the ſame way. Therefore they lay down the principal Cauſe of this diſſolving to be a certain Spirit or ſharp Liquor ſent from the Spleen into the Stomach, which hath great power to diſſolve. And they take this opinion from <hi>Galen,</hi> by whom it is confirmed that a Melanchollick Humor ſent from the Spleen into the Stomach, doth cauſe appetite, and that either by aſtringing or wrinkling the inner Tunicle of the Stomach, or pulling of it by its ſharpneſs, which may be oppoſed; for if it do it by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction, then all aſtringent things would do the ſame; and if by pulling, ſharp things rather than ſowr would provoke Appetite. Therefore they think it more probable, that that humor ſhould ſtir up Appetite by accident, by cauſing want of nouriſhment, by diſſolving of that which comes in. And therefore they allow a more noble uſe of the Spleen than ever the Ancients thought of, namely, to be a chief inſtrument to ſerve the Stomach in Concoction: This may be conjectured from Birds which diſſolve the hardeſt ſeeds, and have a Spleen round about their Stomach or Maw, that it may more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfully inſpire that diſſolving Spirit, or communicate unto it ſowr Liquor. And <hi>Helmont</hi> from his own experience ſaith, that that ſowr Spirit is very ſtrong in Birds; for he relates that when he was a Boy and kept a Sparrow, he gave it his Tongue, which the Sparrow catching with his Bill diſired to
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:49088:117"/>
ſwallow; and that touching the Throat of the Sparrow with the tip of his Tongue, he ſound it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſharp. The diſſolving Spirit inherent in the Gizzards of Birds is proved from Phyſical Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, in which the Gizzards of Hens for to help Concoction are uſually preſcribed in digeſtive pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and it is credible that they produce that effect by helping the diſſolution of the meat, and the ſame are preſcribed in the Stone, and they do much diſſolve them; and that is more manifeſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in that from the Gizzards of Birds, there is a ſalt taken which is excellent to diſſolve the Stone: out of which ſalt, being in grea plenty in their gizzards, Nature being wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Therefore the Spirit or ſharp Liquor which is ſent from the Spleen into the Stomach while it is in its natural ſtate makes a laudable Concoction, but if it be changed it overthrows he actions of the Stomach as aforeſaid, from theſe Poſitions, That a Dog Appetite was ſtirred up, when that ſpirit or acid Liquor, is too active and powerful to diſſolve: So on the otherſide, if the diſſolving power be too weak, or be detective, there followeth a diminiſhed or aboliſhed concoction.

                     <p>Let us hold up this new Doctrine by our own Experiment, for in the yeer paſt, 1648. we had a great Flegnatick and Melanchollick Flux for four months, and were brought thereby to extream leanneſs, by reaſon al our nouriſhment turned into a Flegmatick and ſlimy ſubſtance, from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Stomach which could not wel concoct the ſame, after many Medicines uſed al along that time, the chief part wherof proſited little or nothing, at length by the often uſe of very ſharp Vinegar in a few dayes we were perfectly cured of that violent diſeaſe; by the force of which Vinegar we may conjecture that the natural ſowrneſs which was almoſt loſt was much reſtored: We uſed this Vinegar at our meat with hard Egs, which being cut in pieces we dipped therein, and for ſome dayes we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the uſe thereof in all our meates: And we manifeſtly perceived that if the Vinegar was not very ſharp it did our Stomach little good.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>SIngultus</hi> or Hiccough, is a depraved Motion of the Stomach, by which it deſires to expel ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is hurtful.</p>
                     <p>It is diſtinguiſhed from vomiting, becauſe that which is ſo ſent forth, is contained in the Cavity of the Stomach; and it is wholly turned to throw it out: But in Singultus the matter offending is fixed in the Tunicles of the Stomach, therefore it doth contract it ſelf, and ſhakes its fibres, to exclude it. And that we may comprehend loathing alſo in this Definition, we ſay that the expulſive motion of the Stomach is three waies: For either Nature would ſomtimes riſe to expel, and cannot; or it is not ſufficiently raiſed to this motion, and then it is Nauſea or loathing: ſomtimes it riſeth and expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, and then it is Vomiting: or laſtly, it riſeth to expel, and cannot, and that is Singultus.</p>
                     <p>This is a Convulſive Motion, not a Convulſion, which is only in the Muſcles, and parts given to voluntary Motion.</p>
                     <p>The immediate Cauſes of Singultus are propounded by <hi>Hipp.</hi> Aph. 39. Sect. 6. that is, Empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Repletion, as of a Convulſion. But <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Avicen</hi> ad a third Cauſe, namely, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation by a ſharp matter. Some labor to bring the matter provoking to a kind of repletion, that they may excuſe <hi>Hippocrates.</hi> But when the matter is plain, we need not confound and darken the evidences of things for Authors words: For what is more cleer, than that Singultus comes from the expulſive faculty provoked? Therefore whatſoever can provoke is the immediate cauſe of Singultus or Hiccough. But Humors and Vapors offending either in quantity or quality may prov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e to ſhew how emptineſs makes a Singultus: For ſince its Eſſence is in defect, none will ſay that Nature riſeth to expel a defect; but rather will be moved to refreſh and repair it, and ſo it doth rather move the Attractive than the Expulſive Faculty. But if Singultus follow great Evacuations, as in ſharp Feavers, and malignant, and purging with Hellebore, it is not ſimply to be attributed to the Evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but rather to a malignant quality in the Stomach, coming from the Diſeaſe, or ſome Medicine taken.</p>
                     <p>The Matter cauſing Singultus is either gathered in the Stomach, or ſent from the Liver, Spleen Guts, or other parts; or from the whol Body. So ſharp Nouriſhment, or ſharp Medicines, or ſharp Humors, or gnawing Worms contained in the Stomach, cauſe a Singultus by propriety: but infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the parts adjacent by water or vapors ſent to the Stomach, make it by conſent: as alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Tumor, eſpecially when the Liver is inflamed, doth compreſs the Stomach by which the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive faculty is continually provoked. Finally, Humors may be brought from the whol Body, or ſharp humors to the Stomach, in diſeaſes of the whol Body, as appears in ſharp and malignant Feavers.</p>
                     <p>The Diagnoſis, or knowledg of this Diſeaſe, is manifeſt of it ſelf. But the ſigns of the Cauſe are thus to be diſtinguiſhed, ſo that if it be by propriety, the diſeaſe is more laſting, and there will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſigns of the Humors contained in the Stomach, and the diſeaſe is a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>As to the Prognoſtick: Singultus that comes from any principal Cauſe as Meat, Drink, or Cold, is not dangerous; as alſo that which goes before a Criſis by Vomit, and then other ſigns muſt be healthful.</p>
                     <p>If any have the Hiccough in a great Feaver, the Diſeaſe is very dangerous, <hi>Hipp. in Coacis.</hi> For it comes from ſharp Humors, and malignant, which pull the Tunicle of the Stomach in wardly, and force its expulſive faculty.

Theſe two ſigns coming after Vomiting in acute Diſeaſes, and continuing any time, therefore are ſaid to be deadly, becauſe they declare an inflamation of the Brain or Stomach; which inflamation is not only the cauſe of Hiccoughs and redneſs of Eyes, but alſo of Vomiting. For if Vomiting come from ſharp Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors that gnaw the mouth of the Stomach, and its Tunicles, when thoſe Humors are thrown out by Vomit, the Singultus and vomiting would ceaſe, nor would any ſharp vapor be ſent to the Eyes, which ſhould make them red: But when Vomiting doth not only not profit, but alſo brings after it Hiccoughs and redneſs of the Eyes; it is moſt certain that theſe three, namely, Vomiting, Hiccoughs, and Redneſs of the Eyes, do come from the Inflamation of the Brain or Stomach: for the Brain being inflamed, doth through abundance of blood ſend it to the Eyes, and into their extream Tunicles, whence comes redneſs; to which alſo the Stomach conſenting by the Nerves of the ſixth Conjugati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is eaſily from the Inflamation of the Brain brought to Vomit and Hiccough. Alſo the Stomach inflamed by a concourſe of hot blood to the Eyes by reaſon of the great conſent between thoſe parts, brings Vomit, Hiccoughs, and redneſs of the Eyes, which the beginning of ſuffocations do demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, and the appearance of things before the Eyes which are in the Stomach diſordered; whence <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his Book <hi>del ocis in homine,</hi> affirms that the Eyes are chiefly hurt by Vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>

                     <p>The Cure of this diſeaſe is directed to the Cauſes, which as I ſaid, do either produce it by way of Sympathy, or Propriety.

                     <p>
                        <hi>NAuſea</hi> and Vomiting differ only in degrees, and both are the motion of the Stomach by which it either expelleth or labors to expel things contained therein; therfore Nauſea is a deſire to Vomit with trouble, and only ſending and pewking forth a thin wateriſh Humor by Salivation: whatſoever troubles the Stomach either in quantity or quality uſeth to ſtir that up, when it cannot be voided by reaſon of the weakneſs of the Stomach, or the ſtrength of the upper Orifice, or thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Matter, or ſlimineſs.</p>
                     <p>But Vomiting, which is called in Greek <hi>Emetos,</hi> or <hi>Emeſia,</hi> is a Depraved motion of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, which ſhaketh it, by which the Expulſive Faculty is ſtirred up by Contraction of the Fibres of the lower part and looſening thoſe in the ſuperior, doth ſenſibly with a violent Motion throw up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Matter contained therein, which is troubleſom unto it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is called a Depraved Motion both in reſpect of the Object troubling it, as alſo in reſpect of the Motion it ſelf, which is from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Stomach to the Mouth of it, turning it, when the natural Motion of the Stomach is Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive towards the Guts and the Pylorus.</p>
                     <p>The Differences of Vomitings are taken from their Cauſes, which are either External or Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; therefore it is Divided firſt into Natural and Artificial; the Natural again, is either without a Diſeaſe, or in the Diſeaſe; from whence ariſeth a Three-fold Difference, one is called Periodical, another Critical, and another Symptomatical.</p>
                     <p>Periodical is that which without a Diſeaſe, is uſed for preſervation often, from whence we reade in <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> That the Ancients did Vomit Twice every Month, either at diſtance, or toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>And there are many in our times, who uſe either every Month, or Week, or Day to Vomit Choller, or Flegm; by which they are Preſerved from many Diſeaſes: And this is not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Symptome, becauſe there is no Diſeaſe preſent; but it is rather to be termed a Motion of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>Critical Vomiting often happens in Diſeaſes, and by that the Matter of the Diſeaſe, if preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be firſt made, is wholſomly Evacuated; either al, by which it is Cured; or in part, by which it is Diminiſhed.</p>
                     <p>Symptomatical Vomiting comes from Nature provoked and weakned and without eaſe to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, becauſe it is not enough, or it is nouriſhed continually with the Matter that maketh the Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>Other Differences of Vomitings are taken from the things vomited, for they are either Nouriſhable or Excrementitious; the firſt is of Meat, Chylus, or pure or mixed blood: the latter is of Flegm, Chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, Melancholly, Water, Matter, Worms, and the like.</p>
                     <p>Artificial Vomiting, generally is whatſoever is from an External Cauſe: The External Cauſes, are chiefly Stroaks, Falls, Compreſſion of the lower Belly, Southernly weather, or infectious Air, Poyſonous Breath, Stinking Smels, Violent Exerciſe, Riding, Sayling at Sea, eſpecially in a Southernly wind, beholding or conceiving of ſome filthy thing: And the like External Cauſes which provoke Nature, or move the Humors; but eſpecially things taken in have great force, not only vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits called <hi>Emetica,</hi> and Poyſons which we diſtaſte; but alſo Nouriſhment either hurtful in their Nature, or hated peculiarly of ſome; as in <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> who ſpeaks of one who with eating of Muſhromes or Toad-ſtooles, died Vomiting. The ſame happened to a Courtier of <hi>Antoninus</hi> the Emperor, who by eating much mouldy Cheeſe died Vomiting. The quality of Food wil do the ſame if it be Fat or Oyly, as alſo a propoſterous order in eating, when moiſtning and looſning things
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:49088:120"/>
are eat after aſtringents, and alſo too much food taken, though never ſo good, as appears in Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons; for then Nature being over charged, deſires to throw out what ſhe cannot concoct, to which ſhe is alſo ſtirred up by the evil quality which is brought to thoſe meats by corruption, or evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction.</p>
                     <p>The internal Cauſes are either Antecedent, or Conjunct.</p>
                     <p>The Antedent Cauſes either come from the whol Body, or from ſome proper peculiar part into the Stomach. They come from the whol Body in a Plethory, evil habit or Cathexy, Feavers, and other diſeaſes of the whol Body. The Humors are often derived from ſome peculiar part into the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach in the Inflamation of the Liver, Spleen, or other Obſtruction of the Meſentery, from the Terms ſtopped, or Hemorrhoids, from a Catarrh, or the like. To this you may ad the evil Conformation of the <hi>Porus Cholidochus</hi> when it is not placed into the Duodenum, but into the Stomach, whence they are called <hi>Pichrocholi Ana,</hi> who are often troubled with Chollerick Vomits, by reaſon of this evil Conformation.

                        </gap>o this vomiting cometh by the Periſtaltick motion of the Guts, when they are ſtopped in the Chollick, and the humors cannot well get forth, but come upwards; alſo Worms coming up into the Stomach from the Guts, and pulling the inward Tunicle thereof, do cauſe vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. And laſtly, An Impoſthume broken in the Splee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, Meſentery, and other parts of the Abdomen, uſeth to cauſe a vomiting of Matter.</p>
                     <p>The Conjunct Cauſes of Vomiting, are them before mentioned, when they come to the Stomach; for while they were in other, they were antecedent Cauſes. Theſe are eſpecially divers Humors, ſome bred in the Stomach, eſpecially Flegm, of which there is often much in the Stomach, by Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, and want of Concoction when the Stomach is weak, and turns it into flegm. So alſo is there ſomtimes green Choller in the Stomach bred of corrupt Humors, as <hi>Galen</hi> teacheth, Com. in 2. Progn. and this cleerly appears in ſucking Inſants, who through corruption of Milk in their Stomach uſe to avoid green ſtools like Leeches, or Verdegreeſe.</p>
                     <p>This green Choller which comes from corrupt nouriſhment in the Stomach, is not the ſame with that which cometh from yellow Choller by aduſtion and torrefaction.</p>
                     <p>The Signs of Vomiting are manifeſt. But the Cauſes, as they are divers, ſo they have divers ſigns.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then, if Vomiting come from a fault in the Stomach, there are ſigns of that part being affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, as loathing of meat, heavineſs, extenſion, ſwelling in the Region of the Stomach, ſlow and hand Concoction, ſowr and ſtinking belchings, and other ſigns that ſhew the diſtemper of that part. So if it come from a Common and Organical Diſeaſe in the Stomach, as a Tumor, or Ulcer, the ſigns of theſe Diſeaſes will diſcover themſelves. But if Vomiting come by ſympathy from the whol body or other parts, there will appear ſome Diſeaſe of the whol body, or ſome part.</p>
                     <p>The whol Body is affected in Feavers, evil Habit, Jaundice, Atrophy or want of nouriſhment. But the Principal parts from which the Humors are ſent more frequently to the Stomach, are the Brain, Liver, Guts, and Womb.</p>
                     <p>If the Humors flow from the Brain to the Stomach, there will appear ſigns of diſtillations, frothy and flegmy vomitings, and a great loathing at meat time.</p>
                     <p>If the Humor come from the Liver, it is commonly Choller; and Vomiting before meat, is worſe than after; and there appears ſome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> diſeaſe in the Liver, as pain or tumor.</p>
                     <p>If the Matter come from the Guts, either there will be Chollick or Illiack paſſion, or the ſigns of Worms.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, If it come from the Womb, there is Conception, ſuppreſſion of Terms, or other Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes.</p>
                     <p>We may alſo know by ſome ſigns whether the Humor be contained in the Cavity of the Stomach, or ſtick to the Tunicles thereof. For if it be in the Cavity it is eaſily caſt forth, and there is ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Stomach, and trouble after Meat, which will not ceaſe till the Humors are ſent out by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, which are for the moſt part thrown out alone, and the Meat retained. But if the Humors ſtick to the Tunicles, vomiting is chiefly after Meat, and the Meat is caſt forth without the Humors, but when there is no Meat, there is a loathing, and that which is caſt forth, is thick and ſlimy, and with great ſtraining.</p>
                     <p>The external Cauſes are known by relation of the Patient, as if he hath eat or drunk too much, or received a ſtroak, or eat any evil thing.</p>
                     <p>The ſigns of Vomiting to come are ſhewed by <hi>Galen, lib. 3. de criſ. cap. ult.</hi> as Headach, dark giddineſs, trembling of the lower Lip, gnawing at the mouth of the Stomach, often and much ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
                     <p>You muſt make the Prognoſtick thus:</p>
                     <p>Vomiting from Choller and Flegm, which is neither very thick, nor very much, and which hath both thoſe Humors exquiſitely mingled, is good. For it is commendable in ſubſtance, quantity, and quality. For of all excrementitious Humors, Flegm and Choller are the mildeſt: if then they

                     <p>Chollerick and Flegmatick Vomitings on a critical day are very good: For not only mixed are good, but vomiting of one ſingle, if it cauſe the Diſeaſe. So in Chollerick Feavers, when Choller comes forth critically, or Flegm in Flegmatick Feavers, the Diſeaſe is at an end, or at leaſt there is great hopes of recovery.</p>
                     <p>A Vomiting naturally after a long flux of the Belly, cures the diſeaſe, Aph. 15. Sect. 6. for there is a revulſion of the Matter to the contrary part. And this ſhews that Nature is refreſhed, and gets ſtrength: For as the Phyſitian ought to labor for the retraction of thoſe things that flow to any part. So Nature, when ſhe begins to prevail, makes a repulſion of the Humor, which flows to the part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, that the part may be refreſhed and ſtrengthened.</p>
                     <p>Little and violent vomiting in a ſharp Feaver, is evil; for it is not good to void ſparingly in a Criſis; for it ſignifieth one of theſe two things: Either abundance of Matter which Nature cannot bear, but muſt ſend ſome of it forth: or the weakneſs of Nature, which ſtriveth in vain to ſend for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>h that which is ſuperfluous.</p>
                     <p>Vomitings of divers colors are evil, it ſigniſieth divers Humors lurking in the Body, and therefore Nature will be more put to it with divers enemies; for if it be troubleſom to Nature to contend with divers Nouriſhments, how much more dangerous is it to ſtrive to concoct and tame divers preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Humors, eſpecially in acute Diſeaſes, in which there is but ſhort time to fight, which ſhould be long, that there might be more hope of Nature being a Conqueror.</p>
                     <p>Green Vomiting like Leeks, Verdugreeſe, as alſo blew, black, or ſtinking, is deadly: For it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth that there is abundance of Choller of thoſe colors: And all theſe kinds of Choller uſe to produce malignant and deadly diſeaſes. And if there be a ſtink, it ſhews a great corruption of Humors, with which Nature cannot long conſiſt.</p>
                     <p>In acute Feavers, Vomiting without mixture of Humors is evil, according to <hi>Hipp.</hi> 1. Porrhet. For a pure Humor is not only crude, but incapable of Concoction, becauſe it excludeth not only the act, but the power of Concoction. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> calls every humor that is without mixture, and every Excrement that is hot and crude, <hi>Acriton,</hi> becauſe it is bred either by the defect of ſome part, or by reaſon the watery, ſerous matter is exhauſted by the heat of a Feaver. Therefore in ſharp Feavers it ſhews that there is a great inward inflamation, and for the moſt part ſuch as Nature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conquer.</p>
                     <p>As for the Cure: If Vomiting come from a diſeaſe in ſome other part, it needs no other Medicines than thoſe which are agreeable to the diſeaſe from whence it comes.</p>
                     <p>But if it come from Chollerick, Flegmatick, or Melanchollick Humors which ſtimulate and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the Stomach, either by their quantity or quality, you muſt throw out thoſe Humors by Vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Medicines.</p>
                     <p>But if they be thick and glutinous, or clammy, they are to be cut and clenſed, as we ſhewed in the Cure of want of Appetite.</p>
                     <p>The beſt Vomit in this caſe, is that which is indifferent gentle, and not too weak, as warm Oyl: nor muſt you give ſtrong ones made of Antimony, which draw violently from remote parts. But ſuch as do clenſe and diſſolve the glutinous Humors, as <hi>Gylla Theophraſti,</hi> or white Vitriol prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>If Vomits are unpleaſant, you muſt take away the Matter with often Clyſters and gentle Purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with Rhubarb in them, which aſtringeth and ſtrengtheneth afterwards.</p>

                     <p>THis Diſeaſe is a caſting forth of Blood from the Stomach by the Mouth: And as al other Blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, it comes from the Veins either by Anaſtomoſis, or opening of them by Diapedeſis, or Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refaction, by Rixis breaking, or by Diabroſis corroding, which Diſeaſes of the Veins were ſhewed in the Cure of Spetting of Blood, called Haemoptyſis.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes alſo are the ſame.</p>
                     <p>And Firſt the Conjunct Cauſe; Exceſs of Blood in quantity or quality.</p>
                     <p>Blood offending in Quantity, wil break or open the mouths of the Veins, and ſo comes Rixis, or Anaſtomoſis, which happeneth in ful bodies.</p>
                     <p>If it offend in Quality, as when it is too hot, or thin, it may cauſe an Anaſtomoſis, becauſe heat doth open the Orifices, and thinneſs makes it flow eaſily through; The ſame Qualities may Cauſe a Diapedeſis; for heat doth make thin the Tunicles of the Veſſels, and thinneſs Cauſeth the Blood to paſs through their pores.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Sharpneſs gnaweth and Ulcerateth the Tunicles of the Veins, and ſo produceth a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſis.</p>
                     <p>The Antecedent Cauſes are the ſame with the Conjunct, but they differ in place; for when blood offending either in Quantity or Quality, doth immediately open the Veins: it is called a Conjunct Cauſe; and the ſame being contained in the Veins, is called an Antecedent Cauſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="270" facs="tcp:49088:124"/>The parts ſending, of which the chiefare, the Head, Liver, Spleen, and Womb, are antecedent Cauſes.</p>
                     <p>Often times Blood is carried from the Head to the Stomach by the Pallat and Gullet, or Oeſopha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus: and alſo a violent Catarrh of ſharp and Salt flegm, doth corrode the Stomach, and open the Veins thereof.</p>
                     <p>It is carried from the Liver and Spleen by the Veins that go to the Stomach from the Womb, when blood by the ſtoppage of the Terms, runs back and opens the Veins of the Stomach, ſo that ſome Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have had their Terms by vomiting blood conſtantly at the time.</p>
                     <p>Vomiting of blood comes oftener from the Liver and Spleen, than from other parts, and from the Spleen than the Liver, becauſe it doth more conſent with the Stomach. For it is evident by Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, that the great branch of the Gate Vein, or <hi>Porta,</hi> goeth to the Spleen, from which many Veins are ſent to the Stomach both above and below; and theſe are ſo great that being diſtended with wind or blood, they are as thick as the middle finger: this we have obſerved in Diſſection. Moreover, the <hi>Vas breve</hi> being wide, as in a natural ſtate, it doth continually ſend Melancholly into the Stomach; ſo being in a Preternatural ſtate, it may ſend great plenty of blood. But obſerve here, that in this caſe, that blood is voided by ſtool as well as vomit, both becauſe a part thereof which went to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, is ſent downwards, and alſo becauſe the Meſeraick Veins are open, and ſend blood into the Guts, which by its long paſſage through the Guts groweth black, and comes forth like Tar.</p>
                     <p>The external Cauſes are, all things that can wound or bruiſe, as alſo great heat which cauſeth boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the blood; hence it is that yong men to the age of thirty five, are very ſubject to vomit blood, and other bleeding, as alſo great cold by too much aſtriction may endanger to break the Veins: the ſame doth unſeaſonable Motion and Labor, unuſual Exerciſe, great hallowing, and the like, which move the blood violently in the Veins.</p>
                     <p>And finally, All the Cauſes of Blood-ſpitting afore mentioned. For Blood being violently mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved either in the Veins or Arteries, whether from an external, or an internal Cauſe, goes ſooneſt to that part which is weakeſt, and moſt fit to receive it; and therfore if the Stomach, or the Veins going thither are ſo diſpoſed, there will be vomiting of Blood rather than any other way of bleeding.</p>
                     <p>The Diagnoſtick of this Diſeaſe lieth chiefly in the diſcovery of the part from which the blood comes.</p>
                     <p>If from the Stomach, the ſcituation of the part, and the conſtant pain and heavineſs thereof will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, and there is leſs blood, for the Veins of the Stomach are ſmal, and it comes with loathing, and there is a biting when they ſwallow, as alſo ſomtimes it comes forth mixed with Meat, Flegm, or Choller,</p>
                     <p>If it come from the Head, there will be tickling about the Jaws and Pallat; and ſome blood will be blown out of the Noſe with Snot; there went before it ſome Head-ach or heavineſs, which after bleeding ceaſeth.</p>
                     <p>If from the Liver or Spleen there is more plenty of blood, and ſomtimes a tumor or dolor in the part. From the Liver the blood is red and frothy, from the Spleen it is thick and black. Alſo Blood from the Liver goes moſt downwards, becauſe it commonly goes from thence to the Guts through the Meſeraicks, and muſt aſcend from them into the Stomach to cauſe Vomiting, but it doth eaſier deſcend. Contrarily, that which comes from the Spleen, is rather by vomit, becauſe the Veins from the Spleen to the Stomach, are ſhorter and narrower.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, If from the ſuppreſſion of the Terms, you may know it from the Woman, and it wil come at thoſe times which wil be more probable, if there be no diſeaſe in any other part.</p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſtick: Vomiting of Blood, of what cauſe ſoever, is dangerous; for it either threateneth death ſuddenly; or if it ſtay in the Stomach, and putrifie, it breeds faintings, ſwoonings, and ſuffocations.</p>
                     <p>Vomiting of blood from ſuppreſſion of the Terms, is leſs dangerous than that from the Liver or Spleen; for when they are brought down it is uſually cured, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> taught, Aph. 34. Sect. 5. in theſe words: <hi>When a Woman vomiteth Blood, if her courſes breakdown, ſhe is cured.</hi> And in this caſe only, the opening of the inferior Veins doth provoke the Terms, eſpecially if ſhe take ſomthing beſides for that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>They who after Vomiting of Blood fall into the Dropſie called Aſcites, do die thereof. <hi>Dodonaeus</hi> doth teſtifie that he never knew any that eſcaped: and Experience teacheth that a Dropſie from any kind of bleeding is deadly; for it comes from a great diſſipation of Natural heat, which cannot be repaired.</p>
                     <p>For the Cure of this Diſeaſe uſe Medicines which revel the Blood from the Stomach, and correct its diſtempers and the open Veins with aſtringents and glutinatives. To which ad thoſe things which concern the part chiefly affected, from whence the Blood is ſent into the Stomach, according to the divers Nature, and Diſeaſe of the part.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe Diet is of chiefeſt concernment in this Diſeaſe, let us ſhew ſome Rules therefore.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="271" facs="tcp:49088:124"/>Let his Nouriſhment be commonly aſtringent and Emplaſtick, and cold both actually and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentially, as Barley, Almonds, Rice, Panadoes, Gellies, and eſpecially Starch made without Chalk, and boyled in Milk, which is good alſo in ſpitting of Blood: to all theſe you may alwaies add ſome Pomegranates, or Vinegar of Roſes. Alſo hard Eggs ſteeped in Vinegar are good; Bread crums ſteeped in cold Water, and Chicken Broth, with Sorrel, Purſlam, Plantane, and unripe Grapes; the feet and hips of Sheep, Kids, and Calves, boyled to a Jelly, for the firſt courſe, let him take that which is a ſtringent, as a Quince, or ſowr Apple, or Pear roaſted in the embers, Marmalat of Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or Jelly of ſharp Cherries, Medlers, or Services.</p>
                     <p>Let him abſtain from all ſharp, ſalt, peppered, and fried Meats, as alſo from things that breed much Blood, except he grow weak, and then you may give him them ſparingly. He muſt be but little nouriſhed, for the leſs Blood is bred, the Diſeaſe will be the leſs, and the empty parts by their attraction will ſtay the flux.</p>
                     <p>Let him drink little, only a little Iron Water with a little Juyce of Pomegranates. He muſt drink no Wine except it be thick and ſharp, which we call Tortium, and it muſt be when there is no Feaver.</p>
                     <p>Let the Air be cool, without Wind, Sun, or Moon ſhine; let him ſleep little, and not in the day; for although all fluxes are ſaid to be ſtopped by ſleep, yet this by long keeping the heat in the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may be encreaſed. Let his Belly be looſe, and he kept free from paſſions.</p>
                     <p>After his Diet is thus ordered, we muſt go on to Chyrurgery and Medicine.</p>
                     <p>And firſt take away a little Blood, often, for the greater Revulſion: and that out of the Liver Vein called <hi>Baſilica,</hi> in the right Arm, if it come from the Liver; in the left, if from the Spleen; or from the Ankle Vein, if from ſtoppage of the Terms.</p>
                     <p>Uſe Frictions and Ligatures to the extream parts, and give clenſing Clyſters.</p>
                     <p>Apply Cupping-glaſſes to the Buttocks, Thighs, and Loyns, and to the Hypochondria.</p>
                     <p>Give half a ſcruple of Camphire with four ounces of Oxycrate, or Plantane Water. Which <hi>Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deletius</hi> commends in his Counſels for excellent.</p>
                     <p>If you ſuſpect there is congealed Blood, give him a glaſs of Vinegar and Water, or Oxycrate, for it eaſily diſſolveth blood, and ſends it from the Veins of the Stomach, and ſhuts them up.</p>
                     <p>And foment the Stomach cold with the ſame.</p>
                     <p>When Vomiting ceaſeth, to aſtringe the Veins, uſe theſe following:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>the white of an Egg, Roſe Water and Vinegar, of each one dram and an half: Beat them well; then ad two drams of Chalk. Let the Patient take now and then a ſpoonful.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>prepared Coral, Terra Sigillata, Bole-Armenick, Blood-ſtone, and Troches of Amber, of each one dram: Plantane Water, and Syrup of Myrtles, of each two ounces: mix them for to be uſed as the former, or the pouder in Broths.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Juyce of Plantane four ounces: give it cold morning and evening. Galen</hi> ſaith there is nothing better for to ſtop any kind of Bloody flux.</p>
                     <p>The Juyce of Purſlain and Polyganon, or Knot-graſs taken with Sugar, is very good for the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Plantane and Purſlain Water, of each one ounce and an half: the Syrup of Myrtles half an ounce: the Syrup of Poppies two or three drams: Sal Prunellae one dram: Mix them for a Julep often to be repeated. Or make a Julep of the Decoction of the ſaid Herbs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>old Conſerve of Roſes, and of Comfry Roots, of each one ounce: of Cydoniatum half an ounce: one candied Myrobalan: Troches of Carabe, and Terra Lemnia, of each two drams: Coral prepared, and Crocus Martis, of each one dram: With the Syrup of dried Roſes, make an Oplate to be taken often.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Troches of Carabe do not only aſtringe, but diſſolve congealed blood, therefore uſe them often.</p>
                     <p>The Syrup of Coral is good; but the Tincture drawn newly with the Juyce of Lemmons is better.</p>
                     <p>When Blood is vomited violently, and will not be cured by what hath been ſaid, ſo that death threateneth; you muſt give Narcoticks, either at the Mouth, or by Clyſters.</p>
                     <p>Anoint the Stomach without with Oyl of Roſes, and Myrtles waſhed in Vinegar; and after ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle on the pouder of Coral, Bole-Armenick, and Terra Sigillata.</p>

                     <p>Take of <hi>the Juyce of Plantane, and Knot-graſs, of each one ounce and an half: Vinegar of Roſes one ounce: Oyl Olive ſix ounces: Boyl them till the Juyces are conſumed: then ad oſ San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis Draconis, Maſtich, Pomegranate peels, and Myrtles, of each two drams: Camphire one ſcruple: as much red Wax as will ſerve to make an Oyntment.</hi>

                     <p>Let him drink ordinary Water, wherein Iron hath been quenched, with Syrup of Quinces, and Spirit of Vitriol: alſo make all his Broths of Iron Water.</p>

                     <p>THis Diſeaſe is a violent ſending forth both by Stool, and vomiting corrupt, ſharp, and chollerick Humors.</p>
                     <p>It is called Cholera <hi>Apo tes Choles</hi> from Choller, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſhews from the opinion of the <hi>Gnidian</hi> Phyſitians, 2. meth. c. 2. that it comes from yellow Choller and evil humors like it which is ſent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and down-wards. But <hi>Alexander Trallianus,</hi> lib. 7. c. 14. wil not have this Name to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from a Chollerick humor, becauſe Choller is not alwayes vomited, but alſo often times a ſerous and Flegmatick Humor; but it comes rather <hi>Apo toon Cholaſtoon</hi> from the Inteſtines which were c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Cholados</hi> by the Antients; becauſe theſe Humors come from the Inteſtines and intrals: yet the firſt Etymology is more to be approved, becauſe it is uſed not only by <hi>Galen,</hi> but by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> 7. epid. text. 19. by <hi>Celſus,</hi> lib. 4. cap. 11. and <hi>Aurelianus,</hi> lib. 3. acut. cap. 19. And although a chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick humor is not alwayes ſent forth, yet one like Choller, ſharp, biting, and corrupt, is alwayes voided.</p>
                     <p>Some ſay the Stomach is the part affected, others the Guts, others both; but we muſt be of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len's</hi> mind, who ſaith, 3. de ſympt. cauſ. cap. 2. The part which is principally affected is the Stomach, whoſe expulſive Faculty is vehemently ſtirred up, ſo that it expels the noxious humors at both ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices. But there is no doubt but the Gullet and Guts are ſecondarily affected.</p>
                     <p>Therefore this Affect is a Symptome of the expulſive Faculty being hurt, and vehemently ſtirred up, for it cannot depend upon the retentive faculty debilitated, for then the humors flow by degrees as in Lienteria and Coeliaca Paſſio: but we muſt confeſs that the Diſeaſe is more violent if the Reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Faculty being weak do not reſiſt the expulſive.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, The Concoction is hurt alſo, by which evil humors are bred in the Stomach which ſtir up the expulſive Faculty: but this is an Antecedent Cauſe, <hi>Hipp. 4. de victus ratione in acutis tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu</hi> 104. laies down Two kinds of Choller, the one Moiſt, and the other Dry; the Moiſt is that which hitherto hath been deſcribed, and which is meant only in this definition as being the more uſual<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the Dry is more rare, and it comes from a windy ſpirit going from the Stomach and Guts, and griping thoſe parts through which it paſſeth.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Winds are produced either from the fiery heat of the Stomach corrupting the meat and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it ſtinck, or from windy rank meats, and Onyons, Radiſhes, and the like. <hi>Sennertus</hi> addeth another Cauſe, borrowed from the Hermetical Doctrine, namely, Salt Humors, and Aduſt in the Hypochondria, which grow hot by the mixture of another humor: For (ſaith he) as Salts and the Spirits of Salts mixed with ſharp Spirits, make abundance of flatuous Spirits, as appears by the mixing of Oyl of Vitriol and Aqua fortis with Salt of Tartar. So doth it fal out in mans Body, by the Commixtion of a Salt and Aduſt Humor with other Spirits, there are many windy Spirits pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
                     <p>The immediate Cauſe of this Diſeaſe is a Chollerick, Burnt, Sharp, Salt, or rotten Humor in
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:49088:125"/>
the Stomach, Guts, Spleen, Meſentery, or Prancreas, or ſome nouriſhment of evil quality, ſome ſtrong deadly Medicine, or poyſon taken. <hi>Hipp. 7. Epid. Text.</hi> 90. doth reckon up almoſt all the Cauſes of thoſe evil Humors, in theſe words: <hi>Chollerick Evacuations upwards and downwards, come from eating too much fleſh, especially Swines fleſh not roaſted: Alſo for meats not formerly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, from drunkenneſs with old Wine, and ſweet, from Pine Kernels, Locuſts, rotten Nuts, and from the uſe of Garlick, Leeks, Onions, especially from boyled Lettice, Coleworts and the like crude things; alſo from Tarts, and ſweet meats, Honey meats, Fruits ſoon periſhing, eſpecially from Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumers, Pompions: and theſe Evacuations happen moſt in Summer, for then they are eaſily cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, and are indigeſted.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is worth the obſervation from whence ſo many Chollerick Humors ſhould come, which in this Diſeaſe are ſent forth by Vomit and Stool? It is uſually anſwered, that they come from the Meſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and the places adjacent, and ſomtimes from the whol Body, which though it be probable, yet we may ſay, That Humors corrupted in the Stomach, and parts neer therto, do infect other Humors with their Malignity, and that Nature is conſtrained to ſend to the Stomach and Guts, as venemous Medicines, Antimony, Coloquintida, Elaterium, and the like, by corrupting of the good Humors, do make an Hypercarthaſis, or over-purging.</p>
                     <p>The ſigns of this Diſeaſe, are an often and plentiful ſending forth of Chollerick, ſharp, and other corrupt Humors by vomiting and ſtool; a gnawing of the Stomach and Guts; a ſwelling with wind, pains, thirſt, with much heat and diſturbance; great Nauſeouſneſs, and loathing, which is ſomwhat appeaſed with cold drink, but preſently is caſt forth with hot. The Pulſe is ſomtimes ſmal and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal; ſomtimes with great ſweating, and Convulſion of the Thighs and Arms, ſwooning, coldneſs of the extream parts, and other grievous Symptoms.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes of this Diſeaſe are eaſily known.</p>
                     <p>And firſt, the external are known by relation of the Patient, and thoſe that ſtand by. If he have taken too much, or food of an evil quality, or poyſon, or ſome violent Medicine.</p>
                     <p>The internal Cauſes are known by the quality of thoſe Humors which are ſent forth. We conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture that it comes from the fault of the Stomach, if other parts are not diſtempered, and when there is a continual loathing, gnawing, and pain of the Stomach, the matter is ſent forth green; but if it be bred in the Veins, there is commonly a Malignant Feaver adjoyned.</p>
                     <p>You muſt make your Prognoſticks thus,</p>
                     <p>If it be very violent, it brings commonly ſudden death. If it come from ſome evil Food, it is leſs dangerous; for when that is ſent forth, the Diſeaſe ceaſeth.</p>
                     <p>By how much the greater the Symptomes are, as Swooning, Convulſion and coldneſs of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream parts, by ſo much neerer at hand, is death.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hippocrates in Coac.</hi> ſheweth that this is ſomtimes Critical to Feavers called <hi>Lipyriae,</hi> which can no other waies be cured (as he ſaith) but by a great caſting forth of Choller both upwards and downwards; and theſe Criſes or Judgments happen ſeldom, and ought to be ſuſpected, becauſe they have not the conditions of a good and Health bringing Criſis.</p>
                     <p>If vomiting begin to ceaſe, and the wan and deadly color of the Face to be reſtored, there is hope of Health.</p>
                     <p>In the Cure of this Diſeaſe, in the beginning thereof, ſome evacuation may be allowed while the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and corrupt Humors do flow forth. And you muſt help it forward with drinking warm Water with Syrup of Vinegar, or with a great deal of thin Chicken Broth; which if it provoke not Vomit, will allay the ſharpneſs of the Humors. Or you may evacuate them with Rhubarb brought into a Pill with Syrup of Wormwood, and with clenſing Clyſters.</p>
                     <p>Alſo fat mollifying Clyſters are to be given, made of Milk, Oyl of Roſes, freſh Butter waſhed with Roſe Water, or made of Chicken Broth, or Veal Broth with Yolks of Eggs; with which, as the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe ſhall require, you may mix Narcoticks.</p>
                     <p>Alſo Clyſters of Oxycrate are good, or made of the Decoction of Lettice, Plantane, with a little Vinegar, Syrup of Water-lillies, and Yolks of Eggs.</p>
                     <p>Alſo you muſt qualiſie the Humors ſharpneſs with internal Medicines; as with the Decoction of Purſlane and Plantane with Syrup of Quinces and dried Roſes, with Lapis Prunellae, if there be heat and thirſt.</p>
                     <p>And you muſt ſtop Vomiting with thoſe things both internal and external, which were preſcribed in the Cure of Chollerick Vomiting, Chap. 7.</p>
                     <p>Among which, the Narcoticks are beſt, and eſpecially new Treacle, which given in the quantity of a dram, doth preſently ſtop thoſe violent Evacuations. Laudanum doth the ſame, if you give four grains thereof.</p>
                     <p>If there be great weakneſs (as often happeneth) it is not ſafe to give the whol doſe of Laudanum; but it is better to give one or two grains, and to give it once or twice in a day, as neceſſity urgeth: for ſo the force of the Humors will be reſtrained, and Nature will have time to tame and concoct hem.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="274" facs="tcp:49088:126"/>After vomiting and purging are ſtayed by the Medicines aforeſaid, &amp; the ſtrength is reſtored by Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial means, the Patient ſeemeth to be paſt danger; which doth not only ſomtimes deceive the ſtanders by, but alſo the Phyſitians themſelves: for after a day or two of reſt and intermiſſion, the ſymptomes return more ſtrong and violent, and deſtroy the Patient who was made weak by their former encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; which danger you muſt prevent, not only with Reſtauratives, and things that take away the heat of the Humors, as before mentioned, which muſt be continued after they are appeaſed; but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially with Blood-letting, which doth revel the burnt and boyling blood, and greatly aſſwage it: and you muſt do it twice, or thrice, if the ſtrength be not impaired by the firſt, but rather ſeem to be refreſhed. Some Practitioners adventure in the time of the fit, when the ſtrength is decayed, adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to open a Vein, becauſe they ſay the ſtrength is oppreſſed. But it cannot then be done without danger: and ſomtimes the Patient preſently after dieth, to their ſhame. For though we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg that there is an oppreſſion of the ſtrength by reaſon of the ſuperfluous Humor, which is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Veins, being an Enemy to Nature; yet it cannot be denied but it is greatly decayed by thoſe grievous vomits and ſtools. It is better therefore firſt to allay the violence of the Humors, and after the ſymptomes are aſſwaged to open a Vein.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe in this Diſeaſe the ſtrength quickly fails by ſtrong evacuations, you muſt be very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the reſtoring of it by that way which is ſhewed in the Cure of weakneſs in the eighth Book, and the third Chapter.</p>

                        <hi>Chap. 10.</hi> Of Pain in the Stomach, called <hi>Dolor Ventriculi.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>IT is a ſad and troubleſom ſence in that part, from ſome things that gnaw and ſtretch it till it break, or be wounded.</p>
                     <p>In the Stomach, you muſt conſider three parts, which much differ one from the other, namely, its upper Orifice, and its lower, called <hi>Pylorus,</hi> and the reſt of its Body which maketh up the whol Cavity.</p>
                     <p>The upper Orifice is of exquiſite ſence, by reaſon of the great Nerve which it hath from the ſixth Conjugation, and therefore pain therein is very ſharp, and makes the Heart which is the moſt noble part, and neer unto it ſenſible of the ſame; from thence it is called <hi>Cardialgia,</hi> and <hi>Cardiogmos:</hi> for there is ſuch a neer conſent between the mouth of the Stomach, and the Heart, that the Ancients called it by the name of the Heart, <hi>Cardia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if the Membranes of the Cavity, or the Pylorus be pained, it is called ſimply <hi>Dolor Ventriculi,</hi> and ſomtimes <hi>Colica Ventriculi,</hi> eſpecially when it comes of wind.</p>
                     <p>The immediate Cauſe of this pain, is ſolution of Continuity by things ſharp and diſtending, and they are chiefly Humors, or Wind; and ſomtimes Worms gnawing the Tunicles.</p>
                     <p>Sharp and malignant Humors, as green Choller, or black, ſalt Flegm, corrupt Matter ſent into the Stomach from an Impoſthume broken in the Liver or Breaſt, and all other ſharp Humors which may cauſe pain.</p>
                     <p>Alſo ſharp vapors coming from thoſe Humors uſe to cauſe this pain.</p>
                     <p>The Wind contained in the Cavity of the Stomach doth cauſe ſwelling and painful diſtenſion, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if it be reſtrained within its Tunicles, which makes a very ſtubborn Diſeaſe, and cannot eaſily be ſent out.</p>
                     <p>The Diſeaſes both of the Stomach it ſelf, and of the parts adjoyning, uſe to breed this pain, as any great diſtemper, either hot or cold, and eſpecially an Inflamation, and ſomtimes a Schirrus or other hard Tumor which maketh a heavy pain; as alſo Wounds and Ulcers of the ſame part, and ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in parts adjoyning by wind or other waies, cauſe this pain by compreſſion of the Stomach.</p>
                     <p>Now theſe Humors and Winds which cauſe pain in the Stomach, either come from the whol Body, or ſome parts thereof. From the whol Body, in Feavers, or when the Body is filled with evil Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors. And from other parts, eſpecially the Liver, Spleen, and Brain: from the Liver there comes Choller; from the Spleen, Melancholly; and from the Head, ſalt Flegm.</p>
                     <p>Alſo this pain may ariſe from other extraordinary Cauſes not uſual; as <hi>Schenkius</hi> obſerves from ſtones bred in the Stomach, <hi>lib. 3. obſervat.</hi> And <hi>Fabricius Hildanus,</hi> obſerv. 33. lib. 4 reports that a Woman had a piece of Rind or ruſty Bacon two yeers in her Stomach, wherewith ſhe was continually pained, and which after by taking a Vomit, ſhe threw up, and was cured.</p>
                     <p>The external Cauſes of this Diſeaſe, are either evil qualified, or of ſharp Nouriſhment, which of themſelves produce it, or things apt to breed Wind; or things taken in too great a quantity, which putrifie and turn ſharp; or things that are too hot, and breed much Choller: As alſo ſtrong, ſharp,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:49088:126"/>
deadly Medicines, either taken in too great a quantity, or not ſufficiently corrected, and poyſon.</p>
                     <p>The Diagnoſtick Signs are from the part affected, and the cauſe.</p>
                     <p>And firſt, when the pain is under the Cartilage <hi>Enſiformis</hi> or <hi>Xiphoides,</hi> it ſhews that the upper Orifice of the Stomach is affected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that it is a true Cardialgia in the mouth of the Stomach, you may know more certainly when there is a moſt ſharp pain from the exquiſite ſence of the part with ſuch trouble and diſturbance that the Patient cannot ſtay in a place, or in one poſture, but often ſwounds and fainteth by conſent and ſympathy of the Heart with the Stomach, not only by neerneſs to it, but alſo by reaſon of the diſſipation of the Spirits by the pain. Somtimes the Brain conſents, by Reaſon of the famous Nerve which is in the Stomach, and the ſharp vapors which are directly ſent into the Head from thence, from whence come Cephalalgia, Hemicrania, Vertigo, and Epilepſie.</p>
                     <p>In other parts of the Stomach there are great pains, but they have not ſo great Symptomes, and therefore they are like the Chollick, differing only in place.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes alſo are known by their proper ſigns. The moſt manifeſt are taken from the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for Choller, Flegm, Wind, or Worms, are voided at the Mouth or Belly, it is eaſie to conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture that the Diſeaſe depends upon theſe Cauſes. But if no Humor be diſcharged we may know when Choller, Flegm, or Wind abounds by their proper ſigns; and the ſigns of Worms are to be taken out of their proper Chapter: As alſo the proper diſeaſes both of the Stomach and parts adjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which produce this Diſeaſe, are known by their proper ſigns. The knowledg of the Humor cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this pain, is alſo taken from the time of its coming, encreaſe, and ceſſation. Some are troubled moſt violently before meat, and this ſhews that Choller is predominant, which is ſtirred in time of emptineſs, and drawn to the Stomach, and made more ſharp. Some are pained preſently after meat, becauſe the raw biting Humors, which before were quiet, and fixed to the Tunicles of the Stomach, are moved when Meat is taken, or they which were in the bottom of the Stomach, are raiſed up, and diſturb the mouth of the Stomach. Others are pained in time of Concoction, becauſe ſharp gnawing vapors ariſe from the Matter, cauſing the Diſeaſe from the heat encreaſed in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach in time of Concoction. Others are pained four or five hours after meat, becauſe it is corrupted by evil concoction, and ſo gnaweth the Stomach. Some are worſt after ſleep, and that comes from a Catarrh from the Head in the time of ſleeping, which being heaped up in the Stomach, produceth pain afterwards. Somtimes the pain is appeaſed after Meat, becauſe the ſharpneſs of the Humors is qualified by the ſweetneſs of the Meat.</p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſtick, it is moſt certain that Cardialgia is more dangerous than any other diſeaſe of the Stomach by reaſon of the exquiſite ſence of the Mouth of the Stomach, and its great conſent with principal parts.</p>
                     <p>The danger is more or leſs, according to the malignity of the Cauſe, and the vehemency of the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes.</p>
                     <p>A continual acute Feaver joyned with a great pain of the Stomach, threateneth great danger; as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith, Aph. 65. Sect. 5. <hi>In Feavers, if there be great heat about the Stomach, and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diogmos, it is evil:</hi> for it ſignifieth that there is a great Inflamation of the Stomach, or abundance of bad Humors contained therein.</p>
                     <p>The pain of the Stomach coming from Worms or Wind, is commonly leaſt dangerous, becauſe the Cauſe is not ſo bad, and not fixed to the part. But ſomtimes from Worms ghawing in the Stomach, great Symptomes happen, of which the Patient ſuddenly dieth.</p>
                     <p>So when the diſtemper which begets wind, is ſtubborn and habitual, it is not without danger, for it turneth to a dry dropſie; <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> Aphor. 11. Sect. 4. In a Cardialgia, coldneſs of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream parts ſignifieth death at hand.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of this Diſeaſe is to be varied according to the diverſity of the Cauſes. If it come from the Diſeaſes of other parts, you muſt cure them. But if the Cauſe be in the Stomach alone, the pain comes either from wind, or ſharp Humors and Chollerick, or from Inflamation, Impoſthume, or Ulcer.</p>
                     <p>That which comes from Wind is to be cured by Medicines that diſcuſs and evacuate that flatulent Matter, as alſo the flegm from whence it comes.</p>
                     <p>And firſt you muſt give a gentle Emollient Laxative Clyſter, and preſently after another Carmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native, that is, expelling wind, and diſcuſſing, of the Decoction of Origan, Calamints, Penyroyal, Rue, the leſſer Centaury, Annis ſeeds, Fennel ſeeds, Carrots, and Cummin ſeeds, and the like: In which diſſolve Benedicta Laxativa, Oyl of Dil, Rue, and Honey of Roſemary.</p>
                     <p>If the pain continue, you muſt make a Clyſter of equal parts of Sack, or Hippocras, Oyl of Rue, or of Nuts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with two ounces of Aqua vitae.</p>
                     <p>Or make a Clyſter of white Wine with Oyl of Juniper, or eight drops of the Chymical Oyl of Cinnamon or Cloves, which doth Miracles.</p>
                     <p>Then foment the Stomach with this:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Cypreſs Roots, Galangal, Calamus Aromaticus, of each one ounce: Mints, Origan, Penyroyal, Marjoram, Hyſop, Sage, of each one handful: Annis, Fennel, Caraway, and Carrot
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:49088:127"/>
ſeeds, and Bay berries, of each half an ounce: Chamomel, Melilot, Roſemary and Lavender flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, of each one pugil: beat them, and ſlice them: put them into two bags, and boyl them in Sack; then ſqueeze them, and apply them one after another to the Stomach and all the Belly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When the Matter is not ſo cold, this Fomentation following may be prepared, which is highly commended by <hi>Foreſtus,</hi> becauſe it hath preſently cured when other things failed.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Althaea Roots half an ounce: red Roſes, Chamomel Flowers, and tops of Wormwood, of each one handful: Boyl them in common Water, and Chamomel Water, to one pint and an half, adding in the end a little Rheniſh Wine, Roſe Water, and Vinegar. Make a Fomentation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After Fomentation, anoint with Oyl of Rue, and Dill mixed with Aqua vitae, and a little Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Oyl of Sage, or Cloves.</p>
                     <p>After the anointing, apply a Plaiſter of Bay-berries, or inſtead thereof a Cataplaſm of Honey and Cummin ſeed.</p>
                     <p>While theſe are doing, if there be loathing, you may provoke vomiting gently, or give a Purge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt flegm.</p>
                     <p>After Purging give Oyl of bitter Almonds newly drawn, mixed with white Wine, or Hippocras mixed with Aqua Clareta, or Cinnamon Water.</p>
                     <p>This following Juleps is moſt admirable to aſſwage pain, diſcuſs wind, and ſtrengthen the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Wormwood, Centuary the leſs, and Agrimony, of each half a handful: boyl them to five ounces, and ad to it being ſtrained, one ounce of Sugar. Let him take it two mornings toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Amatus Lucitanus</hi> commends highly the diſtilled Water of Chamomel flowers as a moſt excellent Remedy to aſſwage the pains of the Stomach and Entrals, of which you muſt give three ounces warm. Or in the defect of that, you may make a Decoction of Chamomel flowers, which is ſo much commended by <hi>Foreſtus,</hi> who ſaith that he cured a Merchant with this only Decoction, once only given, of great pain of his Stomach, which made him to roar; which when he had drunk off, he belched, and fell into a ſweat, and all his pain vaniſhed, as by an Inchantment, ſo that he needed no other help. You may alſo make a Vomit at the beginning of the diſeaſe, which by evacuation may abate the pain, of this Decoction, made with Dill ſeeds, or Agarick, or the Roots of Aſarabacca, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving therein, Oxymel, Syrup of Vinegar, or of Roſes Solutive.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Galen</hi> teacheth that a Cupping glaſs applied to the Stomach doth preſently take away pain. But you muſt uſe this Caution, That no crude Humor, or very little, lie in the Stomach, otherwiſe the pain will be encreaſed.</p>
                     <p>Alſo you may with good ſucceſs apply Bread hot from the Oven, cut in the middle, either by it ſelf, or ſprinkled with Spices.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, If the pain continue violent, you muſt uſe a bath of the Decoction of mollifying Herbs that are hot, which is moſt ſafe and powerful, for it takes away the pain by diſcuſſing the wind, and ſending it forth by the open pores, which it will better do, if you give ſome diſcuſſing Medicine to the Patient while he is in the Bath; for both internal and external helps concurring, the work will be done.</p>
                     <p>The Bath muſt be very hot that the wind may be the better diſcuſſed, and the thick Humors melted.</p>
                     <p>If by reaſon of the vehement pain, Clyſters can neither be given nor retained, you muſt give a Purge in the Bath, and let him ſtay therein an hour, or half an hour, till the power of the Medicine touch the Stomach.</p>
                     <p>Somtimes when the violence of the pain threateneth danger, you muſt give Narcoticks, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wiſely given, bring wonderful effects.</p>
                     <p>Some mix Narcoticks with their Purges that the pain may be allayed, and the Matter evacuated: ſuch as the Medicine of <hi>Elidaeus</hi> commended by <hi>Foreſtus,</hi> made thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Diaphoenicon half an ounce: Philonium Romanum two ſcruples: with the Water or Decoction of Chamomel make a Potion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After the pain is gone, let them who are ſubject to this Diſeaſe, be purged once or twice in a month, to take away the immediate cauſe of wind. And let them uſe ſtrengtheners, ſuch as were preſcribed in the Cure of Concoction hurt.</p>
                     <p>That pain which comes of Choller, is to be cured by the evacuation thereof, with a gentle vomit or Purge, or with frequent Clyſters that are emollient, not ſharp or hot.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards, qualifie the ſharpneſs of the Humors with cooling Juleps that thicken, with Emulſions of the great cold Seeds, new Milk, new Oyl of ſweet Almonds, Yolks of Eggs, and the like.</p>
                     <p>In the mean while omit not Opiates, and other ſtrengtheners preſcribed in the former Cures.</p>
                     <p>And at laſt, when need requireth, uſe Narcoticks.</p>
                     <p>Apply outwardly a Cataplaſm of Bread and Milk, with yolks of Eggs, and Saffron.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="277" facs="tcp:49088:127"/>Or Bread from the Oven broken in the middle and dipt in Vinegar.</p>
                     <p>Or Foment the part with the Decoction of Chamomil-flowers, Violets, and Water Lillies, or which is beſt, put the Patient in a warm Bath, for that is moſt proper.</p>
                     <p>After the pain is gone leſt it ſhould return, let the Patient Purge twice every month, and let the hot Diſtemper of his Belly be corrected with a Cooling Diet and Convenient Remedies.</p>
                     <p>That Pain which comes from Inflamation, Impoſthume, or Ulcer, may be Cured with the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies Preſcribed in the following Chapter.</p>

                     <p>ALthough al kinds of Tumors may ariſe in the Stomach as wel as other parts, yet we wil ſpeak here only of a Phlegmon or Inflamation, which is moſt uſual; the other happen ſeldom, and may be Cured by the ſame Method with the Tumors of other internal parts.</p>
                     <p>The Inflamation of the Stomach is a preternatural Tumor coming of Blood which is ſent into the ſubſtance of the Stomach and its Membranes by the Veins derived from the branches of the Vena Porta.</p>
                     <p>This Blood is either pure and makes a proper Phlegmon, or mixed with Choller, Flegm, or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly, and makes a Phlegmon Eryſipelatous, Oedematous, or Schirrous.</p>
                     <p>The External Cauſes may be many, al that inflame the Blood, as hot meats, wine, or al that can drive it to the part; as a blow upon the belly, eſpecially when it is ful; to which you may ad things that are very ſharp and very hot, as Cantharides, ſublimate.</p>
                     <p>The ſigns of this Diſeaſe, called Diagnoſtica, are a great Pain, burning, pricking, diſtending and beating, reaching to the back; you may feel a Tumor, and ſomtimes ſee it, the ſhoulders are drawn downwards; the breathing is difficult, as alſo ſwelling and belching, ſomtimes blood is vomited; there is a moſt burning Feaver, with moſt greivous Symptomes.</p>
                     <p>If the Inflamation be pure only from blood, it is ſomwhat gentler; but if it be with Choller called Eryſipeals, there are greivous Symptomes, and the febris called Lipyria in which the exterior parts are cold, and the internal burn, and there is an unquenchable thirſt; ſuch a kind of Feaver uſeth to be in an Eryſipetous inflamation of the inteſtines.</p>
                     <p>Like to this Inflamation of the Stomach, is that which is in the upper part of the Liver by which the Stomach is covered or in that part of the belly which lieth upon it; which is only diſtinguiſhed by the deadly Symptomes, for then the Stomach hath the moſt deſperate.</p>
                     <p>From what hath been ſaid is eaſie to Prognoſtick and to pronounce this Diſeaſe to be for the moſt part deadly.</p>
                     <p>But that is moſt Dangerous which is over the whol Stomach, or its upper part, or which is like to an Eryſipetas.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Galen</hi> 3. Prorrhet. ſhews, That much Loathing and Rumbling of the belly, is evil: For it ſhewes that evil Humors do ſtick cloſe to the Tunicle of the Stomach, and pul them to provoke Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion.</p>
                     <p>If the Inflamation do not kill, nor is diſperſed, it turns to an Impoſthume, which is known by the mitigation of the Pain and the Feaver, while the Tumor remaineth.</p>
                     <p>After the Impoſthume is broken there remaineth an Ulcer which is known by voiding of Matter by Vomit and Stool.</p>
                     <p>But an Ulcer is produced in the Stomach, not only from an Impoſthume, but from other Cauſes which we ſhal here reckon up, leaſt we ſeem defective in the Theory.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes of Ulcers in the Stomach, are either Internal or External.</p>
                     <p>The Internal are ſharp Humors bred in the Stomach, or ſent thither from other parts, as yellow Choller, or black, or ſalt Flegm.</p>
                     <p>The External are ſharp Medicines that Corrode, or Poyſons, and Wounds of the Stomach not wel Cured, which turn into Ulcers; as alſo the breach of ſome great Veins which could not wel grow to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, after much Vomiting of blood.</p>
                     <p>An Ulcer bred in the Stomach is known chiefly by Matter which is caſt forth by Vomit or Stool, to which principal ſign there are others to be added: Firſt there is perceived in the belly a pricking pain joyned with burning, eſpecially when any thing is taken that is ſtrong in quality, either ſharp, ſalt, or ſowr, or very hot, or cold: there is alſo no Appetite, ſtinking belching, and a conſtant lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring Feaver.</p>
                     <p>The Prognoſtick is alwayes deadly, except the Ulcer be very little, and only in the ſuperficies,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:49088:128"/>
and without a Feaver. For the Membrane of the Stomach being ulcerated, being a Spermatick part, will hardly grow together again: the Nouriſhment will not be well concocted in a Stomach ill affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, but will be thrown out before concoction, and ſo rend the Ulcer. Moreover, Medicines do little good becauſe clenſers which are required for cure of Ulcers increaſe pain; and dryers which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo are required, are continually hindred by the Meat and Drink, and Chyle, and other Humors which continually are in a weak Stomach.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of the afore ſaid Diſeaſes, is ſeveral.</p>
                     <p>And firſt, the Cure of Inflamation is to begin with Blood-letting often in both Arms, as the ſtrength will endure. And although by reaſon of ſwooning and coldneſs of the extream parts, the ſtrength ſeem at firſt to be impaired, yet becauſe it comes from oppreſſion, it requires evacuation, and therefore blood-letting muſt not be denied.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, the opening of the Hemorrhoids, if the Patient be uſed to that evacuation, doth revel Blood from the Stomach. Alſo Cupping-glaſſes both dry, and with Scarrification to the Shoulders, Back, and Buttocks, with Ligatures and Frictions of the extream parts, and heating of them (becau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                     <p>We diſallow Purges in this caſe, becauſe they trouble the Humors, and draw them to the part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Avicen</hi> commends the Decoction of Tamarinds, or half an ounce of Caſſia diſſolved in Whey, or Endive Water if it be given every day to the ſeventh day, becauſe they purge not by attraction, but by mollifying, mitigate ſharpneſs, and aſſwage pain. But it is better in the beginning to abſtain from all Purges. After the ſeventh day is paſt, when there appear ſome ſigns of Concoction and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, you may give a Purge of Rhubarb one dram, with one ſcruple of red Sanders infuſed in Borrage Water, adding one ounce or two of Syrup of Roſes, that the filth which ſticketh to the part may be brought forth more powerfully.</p>
                     <p>In the mean while, you muſt every day give Emollient, Cooling, and Lenitive Clyſters, ſuch as theſe:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Chicken Broth, or the Decoction of Mallows and Violets, of each one pint: Caſſia new drawn, one ounce: Oyl of Roſes and Violets, of each two ounces: Sugar one ounce and an half: With two Yolks of Eggs make a Clyſter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You muſt give altering and ſtrengthening Medicines at the Mouth, they may be the ſame which were propounded in the Cure of the Pain of the Stomach from a Chollerick Humor.</p>
                     <p>But the Syrup of Water Lillies, and of the Juyce of Purſlain, are peculiarly good, eſpecially in the beginning, becauſe they ſupply the place of Repelling Medicines.</p>
                     <p>Alſo Emulſions made of the four great cold Seeds, and white Poppy Seeds are good, for they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage pain and heat. As alſo theſe following Juleps.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Roſe Water three ounces: Plantane Water two ounces: the Juyce of Sorrel and Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granate Wine, one ounce and an half: Sugar of Roſes one ounce: Boyl them a little, and ſtrain them. Let him take two ounces twice or thrice in a day.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the pain be great, you may give the Syrup of Poppy.</p>
                     <p>Let his Drink be barley Water with Syrup of Violets taken cold.</p>
                     <p>In the progreſs of the Diſeaſe, you muſt mix other Medicines with the aforeſaid, which may help to diſſolve. To this end you may preſcribe theſe following Juleps:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Syrup of Water Lillies, Apples, and of the Juyce of Purſlain, of each one ounce: Syrup of Sea Wormwood half an ounce: Lettice, Sorrel, and Fennel Water, of each three ounces: the pouder of Diamargariton frigid one dram: Make a Julep for three Doſes to be taken twice in a day.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To theſe you may adreſtoring Opiates, Narcoticks, and the like, all which are to be varied many waies, according to the Judgment and Wiſdom of the Phyſitian.</p>
                     <p>Turpentine waſhed with Wormwood Water, if it be given twice or thrice doth either diſſolve or maturate the Impoſthume of the Stomach.</p>
                     <p>Let this following Fomentation be applied in the beginning.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Sorrel Roots two ounces: Endive, Succory, and Mallows, of each one handful: Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and white Poppy ſeeds, of each three drams: white and red Sanders, of each half a dram: Violets, and Water Lillies, of each one pugil. Make a Decoction, adding a little Roſe Vinegar. Let the Stomach be fomented warm therewith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or make one with the diſtilled Waters of Lettice, and Water Lillies with a little Vinegar, and Pouder of Triaſantalon.</p>
                     <p>After fomenting, let the part be anointed with Oyl of Roſes and Violets mixed, or with this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Oyl of Roſes one ounce and an half: Oyl of Violets, and Roſe Vinegar, and of the

Juyce of Sowthiſtle, of each half an ounce: Boyl them to the conſumption of the Juyces; then ad of red Sanders one dram: red Roſes half a dram: Lavender and Camphire, of each half a ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: as much Wax as will make an Oyntment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Cataplaſms in the beginning are not good, becauſe they burden the part with their weight, and by retaining the heat, encreaſe the Inflamation.</p>
                     <p>In the declination, when the Tumor is reſolved, which is chiefly to be deſired; you may apply a diſſolving Fomentation, made thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Flower deluce Roots two ounces: the Leaves of Mints, Marjoram, Penyroyal, Sea Wormwood, of each one handful: Annis and Foenugreek ſeeds, of each two drams: Grains of Kermes one dram: the flowers of Stoechas, Roſemary, Chamomel, of each one pugil: Make a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, adding in the end a little white Wine. With this foneent the Stomach.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After fomenting, anoint the part with Oyl of Wormwood, Nutineg, Spike, and the like; of which you may make an Oyntment with a little Wax and Pouder, Orris Root, or Cinnamon. But Emplaſters and Cataplaſms, becauſe they burden the part with their weight, are not here good.</p>
                     <p>But if the Tumor tend to Suppuration, foment the part with the Decoction of the Flowers of Chamomel and red Roſes: Then apply this following Cataplaſm:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Althoea Roots two ounces: Brank <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſine, and Roſes, of each one handful: Boyl them well, and beat them together: then ad of Barley meal, Lin-ſeed, Foenugreek and pouder of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momel, of each half an ounce: white and red Sanders, of each two drams: with Oyl of Roſes, and Chamomel. With a little Hens Greaſe make a Cataplaſin, often to be renewed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After the Impoſthume is broken, let the Ulcer be clenſed with Hydromel, given in a ſmal quantity: To which you may ad the Manna of Frankinſence, according to <hi>Galens</hi> Precept. Or give it with Barley Water with Sugar of Roſes in the beginning, in time of heat.</p>
                     <p>When the Ulcer groweth old, of what Cauſe ſoever it come, either from ſharp corroding Humors, or burning Medicines, or Poyſon, Broths of cool Herbs, and drying of Barley, Almonds, and Sugar of Roſes, or new Milk with Sugar, and a little Honey, are very good. At length, Chalybeate Milk and Iron Water for ordinary drink; or Water wherein a piece of Bole-Armenick, or Terra Sigillata hath been ſteeped, is very excellent. To which you may put a little ſharp Wine, if there be but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle heat in the part.</p>
                     <p>Then give this Apozeme:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Barley one pugil: Scabious, Agrimany, Burnet, and Maiden-hair, of each half a a handful: Melone ſeeds two drams: red Roſes dried, one pugil: make a Decoction to one pint, in which diſſolve three ounces of Syrup of dried Roſes. Make an Apozeme for four doſes to be reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted often.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Alſo the Decoction of China, is excellent for internal Ulcers, when there is no Feaver, taken twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty daies, or more, ſweating gently, for ſo the Ulcer will be dried by degrees. But if you fear a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, boyl the China Root aforeſaid in Chicken Broth, or Pidgeon Broth with the aforeſaid Herbs, and Barley made clean.</p>
                     <p>In an old Ulcer, the drinking of Mineral Waters, either of Vitriol, Iron, or Allum, for a Month to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, are very good.</p>
                     <p>In the whol time of the Diſeaſe to keep the Stomach clean, uſe gentle Purges, as Rhubarb, Tama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinds, Myrobalans, Syrup of Roſes, and Diacatholicon, taken once in a week.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, To heal up the Wound, uſe theſe following:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Bole-armenick, Terra Sigillata, red Coral, and Blood-ſtone waſh'd all in Roſe Water, of each one dram: Sanguis Draconis, Gum Arabick and Traganth, of each half a dram: white Poppy ſeeds bruiſed and parched, Hypociſtis, Frankinſence, and Sarcocol, of each one ſcruple: Sugar of Roſes one ounce: Make a Pouder, of which take a dram in Plantane Water, or Conſerve of Roſes every day.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or make an Opiate of the ſame Pouder with Conſerve of Comphry and Roſes, Syrup of Quinces, and Myrtles. Or you may make Troches of the ſame Pouder, with the Mucilage of Fleabane ſeeds, or Gum Traganth. All which the Patient may uſe by turns, leſt he grow weary of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Outwardly, to cloſe the Ulcer, you may apply to the Stomach, a Fomentation of the Decoction of Wormwood, Roſes, Pomegranate peels, Galls, Pomegranate Flowers, Myrtles, Frankinſence, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtich, or the like. And laſtly, anoint the part with an aſtringent Oyntment, or apply an aſtringent Emplaſter.</p>

                     <p>THe Chollick takes its Name from the part affected which is the Gut called <hi>Colon:</hi> which is long and winding, and ordained for receiving the Excrements of almoſt al the Body; theſe Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments retained too long, uſe to cauſe this pain.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the Cauſes of the Chollick are excrementitious Matter, which by diſtending, pricking or corroding can make a Solution of Continuity, and theſe are either Winds or Humors.</p>
                     <p>Winds are bred of Crudities, or a cold Diſtemper of the Stomach or Inteſtines; and if they be
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:49088:130"/>
not ſent forth by reaſon of the hard excrements or other things that obſtruct the Inteſtines, they are in great plenty ſhut up in the Guts, eſpecially the <hi>Colon;</hi> and make a very violent pain.</p>
                     <p>Alſo groſs Humors, Cold and Flegmatick, being faſtened upon the Tunicles of the Guts cauſe the ſame pain both by gnawing, if they are ſharp or ſalt; as alſo by cooling the part, which by con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence muſt ſuffer Conſtriction and Divulſion, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſpeaks of himſelf, That having had a great Fit of the Chollick did void glaſsy Flegm that was actually cold; and by producing Wind which is eaſily raiſed from a groſs, ſlimy, and ſlow Humor, by a weak heat.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Chollerick and ſharp Humors; as alſo Melanchollick and ſowr by pricking and twiching the Guts, make theſe pains: but we may doubt in the action of theſe Cauſes how the Chollick ſhould be ſomtimes more violent, ſomtimes more remiſs, ſince the ſame matter remaineth in the Inteſtines? To which Doubt we thus Anſwer, That the matter doth ſomtimes lie quiet, and then it cauſeth none or very little pain; but ſomtimes it is moved and ſtirred up by divers Fermentations which happen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Humors, as in an Epilepſy, the ſits of the Mother and Agues.</p>
                     <p>But you muſt obſerve diligently that thoſe Winds or Humors do not only remain in the Cavity of the Guts, for then were they eaſily excluded by evacuating, clenſing, and carminative Medicines, but for the moſt part they are fixed to the very Coates of the Guts, whence it comes that they are not ſo eaſily taken off; but they make a long and a ſtubborn Diſeaſe which wil not eaſily be cured: So thick Flegmatick and Melanchollick humors to flow by degrees through the veins of the Cuts into their ſubſtance, and do not preſently cauſe pain; but til they ſo encrea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e that they provoke nature to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel them, and ſo being moved they cauſe pain; or ſend out Vapors which being included in the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles of the Inteſtines, do ſtretch and extend them, and finding no paſſage, cauſe a long pain. And Choller being after the ſame manner ſpread and ſucked into the veins of the Guts and the Tunicles thereof doth ſtir up ſharp pains which uſe to be long, becauſe the Choller is very hard to be pulled from the ſubſtance of the Guts.</p>
                     <p>There is another kind of Chollerick Chollick, which turns into a Palſie, not known to the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, which comes of a Chollerick Humor, not in the Gut Colon as the former, but ſuddenly ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Membranes of the Abdomen, and it is carried thither from the Cyſtis, or bladder of Gall, or the Meſentery in the Criſis of continual Feavers, or from great anger, or ſome other external Cauſe, when by reaſon of Obſtructions it cannot be ſent by the common paſſages, but by a prepoſterous mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it is preſently ſent to the aforeſaid Membranes of the Abdomen, hence comes a cruel pain like that of the Chollick, which neither by Clyſters, Formentations, or other Medicines can be Cured; but continueth many Months, by which means the body conſumeth, ſomtimes it is like an intermitting Feaver, ſomtimes and often like a continual lingring Feaver: and at length when the pain begins to ceaſe, there is a Palſie, by reaſon the Humor gets by degrees into the back by the Membranes of the Abdomen: This Palſie doth trouble the upper parts moſt; but the Thighs and Legs commonly are pained, in ſome they are wholly reſolved and made numb, becauſe the Choller being light flyeth to the upper parts: Somtimes it gets into the Brain, and begets Epileptick Convulſions, from whence death commonly enſueth.</p>
                     <p>There are other Cauſes of the Chollick, but leſs uſual; namely, Stones bred in the Guts, and knots of Worms which ſtop them: The compreſſion of the Guts from Tumors in the adjoyning parts, or narrowneſs by reaſon of Inflamation, and other Tumors of the Inteſtines, or Contorſion, or twiſting of them by reaſon of Wind which is the way to the Iliack Paſſion; ſomtimes alſo the Matter cauſing the Chollick is Poyſonous and Malignant, and makes a Peſtilent Chollick; as <hi>Paulus Aegineta</hi> reports, That a Peſtilent Chollick in Italy infected moſt of the Roman Provinces. Finally al hard Bodies by Obſtructing and Diſtending the Guts may make a Chollick, as ſtones bred there, many Cherry-ſtones ſwallowed, hard Cheeſe, and the like: <hi>Platerus</hi> reports, That a certain Governor long laboring of the Chollick with Convulſions, after the uſe of Clyſters, voided a great quantity of hard Cheeſe which had a long time ſtuck in his Guts, becauſe before his Sickneſs he had eaten immoderately thereof.</p>
                     <p>The External Cauſes are Cold Air, which conſtringe and indurate the Belly; or too Hot Air, by which the Excrements grow hard, and looſe their moiſture; the uſe of meat and drink not agreeing with the Conſtitution; as raw Fruits, and binding; groſs meats, and hard of digeſtion; too much reſt, and immoderate ſleep; unſeaſonable exerciſes, immoderate venery; and other External Cauſes which diſturbe the Concoction of the Stomach.</p>
                     <p>The Knowledge of this Diſeaſe generally is eaſie: For firſt the pain is very ſharp, for if it be light it cannot be called a true Chollick from the Opinion of <hi>Galen,</hi> lib. 6. de loc. aff. cap. 2. And it is ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times moveable, ſomtimes more in one place than in another: ſomtimes in the region of the Liver, ſomtimes of the Spleen, Stomach, Reins; ſomtimes above, ſomtimes beneath the Navel, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is moſt upon the left ſide; in which, as <hi>Bauhinus</hi> firſt obſerv'd, there is a little ſtreightneſs; for when the Excrements in the upper and wideſt part of the Colon grow into hard lumps according to its Capacity great, and then by Wind are driven into a ſtreighter part, they muſt needs paſs with
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:49088:131"/>
much pain, in which Symptome the Chollick, and the Spleen, and the Stone, are not diſtinguiſhed but by compariſon of other ſigns; for ſomtimes the pain is like an Auger boring, or a Stick faſtened, more fixed in ſome part. When the Stomach conſenteth, there is vomiting of Flegm, Choller, that is green or the like. After Meat the pain is greater, becauſe the Stomach being filled compreſſeth the Inteſtines. The Belly for the moſt part is bound, ſo that the Patient cannot ſo much as break wind, and if any thing be voided either naturally or by art, it is for the moſt part windy, and like Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dung, with water at the top, becauſe it is moſt Flegm which uſeth to be ſo. Somtimes the Belly is ſo bound that in the heigth of Pain, Purging Medicines that are very ſtrong, will not work.</p>
                     <p>The Signs of the Cauſes are thus to be diſtinguiſhed:</p>
                     <p>If the Pain come of Flegm, it is not ſo great, unleſs it be mixed with wind which cannot get forth of the places wherein it is contained: for then the pain is very great; ſomtimes in one part, as if it were bored through with a wimble or ſtick; ſomtimes in many, if the wind do remove, the Patient is better for hot, and worſe for cold things. He uſed a Diet formerly which bred flegm, his water is ſomtimes more crude and white, not alwaies, which deceiveth yong unexperienced Phyſitians, and ſomtimes in a flegmatick and flatulent Chollick, the Urine will be yellow and reddiſh by reaſon of the extraordinary pain which doth inflame the Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Cap. 11. <hi>Let no man be deceived</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to think by the foulneſs, inflamation, and redneſs of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine, that therefore the Diſeaſe is hot; for that is common to all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rines.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the Chollick proceed of wind, there will be a ſtretching pain, and a ſwelling of the Belly: the Patient perceiveth a rumbling of the Belly, and much wind, and he is better when he breaketh it: he uſed a Diet to breed it, as unreaſonable drinking of cold water, often uſe of Peaſe, Rapes, Cheſnuts, Sallets, Fruits, and the like. And if the wind be contained in the Cavity of the Guts, the pain is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, not in one place, and is ſomtimes greater. But if it be in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>oats and Tunicles of the Guts, the pain is fixed becauſe the wind cannot move, and it is conſtant becauſe it cannot get forth.</p>
                     <p>If the Chollick come from a ſharp and Chollerick Humor, it is moſt grievous, pulling, and pricking, there is heat, thirſt, and often a Feaver, the Urine is very Chollerick. It is worſe for hot Meats and Medicines, and better for cold. By ſending forth of Choller the diſeaſe is diminiſhed, and there went before, a Diet breeding Choller.</p>
                     <p>The pains of other parts under the Navil, are eaſily diſtinguiſhed from the Chollick by their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſigns, except the Stone, whoſe ſigns are ſo like with thoſe of the Chollick, that very skilful Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians have been deceived by them: As <hi>Galen</hi> himſelf was, as he confeſſeth 2. <hi>de loc. aff. cap.</hi> 5. when he was troubled with the Chollick, he thought that he had the Nephritis, and that a ſtone was faſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in one of the Ureters till the Humor was purged away, and the pain ceaſed; after which he found it to be the Chollick.</p>
                     <p>But by theſe following ſigns theſe two Diſeaſes may be plainly diſtinguiſhed, if they be well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The Nephritis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or pain of the ſtone, is fixed in the Reins, and comes from thence to the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticles, according to the length of the Ureter: But the Chollick is movable, and girts about the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Belly like a girdle.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Chollick encreaſeth after Meat by reaſon of the compreſſion of the Inteſtines from the full Belly: but the Nephritis encreaſeth not, but rather decreaſeth, becauſe ſome of the Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is carried to the Reins, which doth ſomthing aſſwage the pain.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, In the Chollick, the vomiting is more vehement, and the Body is more bound, becauſe the Colon lieth in the bottom of the Stomach, and the Inteſtines being ſtretched, or much provoked, do conſtringe themſelves that they may expel what is noxious. But both the Symptomes are common to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both Diſeaſes, ſo that you can hardly know their intenſion and remiſſion, becauſe a ſtrong Nephri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick pain, may cauſe a greater vomiting and aſtriction of the Belly, then a weak Chollick.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, In a Chollick there is more eaſe found after Evacuation than in a Nephritis.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, In a Nephritis or the ſtone, the Urine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>firſt clear and thin; afterwards there is a ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and at length ſand and little ſtones are voided. But in the Chollick the Urine is thick from the beginning.</p>
                     <p>As to the Prognoſtick: The Chollick for the moſt part, if it be gentle and little, and not long, nor in one place conſtantly, but intermitting and not binding the Belly, is curable, and without danger. But if the pain is very great and fixed in one place, not intermitting, and if the Belly be bound that nothing can get forth, with great watchings, and if vomiting follow, hiccoughs, doting, and coldneſs of extream parts, with cold ſweats, it is deadly.</p>
                     <p>A ſtubborn Chollick coming of ſharp and Chollerick Matter degenerateth into other grievous Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, as Arthritis, Epilepſie, or Paralyſis, which is moſt uſual.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:49088:131"/>
                        <pb facs="tcp:49088:132"/>

An Epidemical Chollick, which is contagious and peſtilent, is commonly deadly.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of this Diſeale is divers according to the variety of the Cauſes.</p>
                     <p>And firſt, there is the ſame Cure of a flatulent and pituitous Chollick, which begins with an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mollient Clyſter, after which followeth one Carminative and diſcuſſing, as was preſcribed in the <hi>Dolor Ventriculi,</hi> from the like Cauſe, which muſt be repeated twice, thrice, or four times in a day, till the pain be gone; and if he go not to ſtool in one or two Clyſters, as ſomtimes happeneth, you muſt give a ſharp Suppoſitory. In one of the aforeſaid Clyſters, you may do well to ad four ounces of the <hi>Aqua Benedicta Rulandi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or two or three drams of Coloquintida boyled in an Emollient and Carminative Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                     <p>If Clyſters will not give eaſe, you muſt not ſtay too long upon them, but uſe ſome gentle Medicine. It hath been obſerved that when a ſick man had taken three Clyſters without benefit, that another Phyſitian came and gave but one ounce and an half of Manna, with two ounces of the Oyl of ſweet Almonds in the fat Broth of a Hen, and cured the Patient. But in a pain that comes from grofs flegm you muſt give ſtronger Medicines.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards, Fomentations, Oyntments, Baths, Emplaiſters, and the like, are good, which were declared in the Cure of the <hi>Dolor Ventriculi</hi> of the ſame Cauſe, to which you may ad ſome ſpecifical things, which are fit for this Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>Waſh the Guts of a Wolf in white Wine, then dry them in an Oven in an Earthen pot, till they may be poundered. Let the Patient take a dram thereof in white Wine, and he will be preſently cured.</p>
                     <p>Boyl fair Water, and ad to it the fourth part of Oyl, and ſome groſs Pepper; let him take three or four ſpoonfuls as hot as he can endure it, and the pain will be inſtantly gone.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the beſt Aloes one dram: Laudanum four grains: Diagridium ſix grains: Mix them and make ſix Pills gilded: Let him take them at a convenient time. They take away the pain aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one hour, and then purge out the noxious humor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Inſtead of theſe you may give Diaphoenicon, and Philonium Romanum, as is preſcribed in the Cure of the pain of the Stomach. <hi>Hipp. Lib. de intern. aff.</hi> propoundeth a Purge of Purſlain, and Juyce of Poppies.</p>
                     <p>Six ounces of Oyl of ſweet or bitter Almonds, do aſſwage pain, and caſt the Matter cleaving to the Inteſtines downwards.</p>
                     <p>If you mix it with theſe things following, it will be better:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Oyl of ſweet Almonds, or Sallat Oyl for poor people, four ounces: Spaniſh Wine one ounce and an half: Syrup of Poppies one ounce: Mix them for a Potion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Alſo Oyl of ſweet Almonds mixed with Manna in fat Broth as beforeſaid, doth eaſe pain, and eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate the Matter offending.</p>
                     <p>One dram of Annis ſeeds poudered and given in Wine, doth firſt aſſwage, and the ſecond time it is given, quite take away the pain; applying at the ſame time a Cataplaſm of Turpentine three ounces, laid on with Stuphes ſprinkled with Pepper and Sanguis Draconis finely poudered, of each one dram.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Galbanetum Paracelſi</hi> is good to diſcuſs the Humor if the whol Belly be anointed therewith. The deſcription is in <hi>Crato</hi> thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Gum Elemi, lvy, Galbanum, Oly of Bayes, of each equal parts: diſtil them in Sand with a Retort; keep the Liquors aſunder, firſt the Water, then the cleer Oly, then the thick Oyl like Honey, which you muſt uſe firſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Calamus Aromatious one ounce: Galangal three drams: the outward yellow of the Orange peel four ounces: Cinnamon, Annis, and Fennel ſeeds, of each three drams: Cummin ſeeds ſix drams: Juniper berries green half an ounce: Bay berries three drams. Pouder them finely, and infuſe them in ſix pints of the beſt Spaniſh Wine in a bot place ſix dayes; then diſtil them in</hi> Balneo Mariae. The Doſe is one ounce after Evacuations.</p>
                     <p>You may with good ſncceſs apply to the Belly Gum Caragna, and Tacamahacha; but firſt let a great Cupping-glaſs be applied to the Navil.</p>
                     <p>Although you apply not the Plaiſters, yet you muſt not forget to cup; which as <hi>Galen,</hi> ſaith, doth diſcuſs pain that comes of wind like an Enchantment.</p>
                     <p>If the Diſeaſe laſt long, you may cure it with a Decoction of Guajacum continued for many daies, Purging ſomtimes, and giving often Clyſters. And if it come of glaſſy flegm, let Guajacum be boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Wine, as <hi>Amatus Luſitanus</hi> uſed it with good ſucceſs, <hi>Curat. 32. Cent.</hi> 1.</p>
                     <p>After the pain is allayed, uſe an Apozeme to purge flegm for the carrying away of the reliques, or inſtead thereof, the Decoction of an old Cock made with inciſing, attenuating, and purging things. Or that excellent Julep preſcribed in the Chollick of the Stomach.</p>
                     <p>A Chollerick Chollick is cured by Emollient Clyſters, and ſuch as temper the acrimony of the Humors.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="284" facs="tcp:49088:133"/>Let the Belly be Fomented with an Emollient Decoction, which is Anodine; or which is better, make a Bath of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Alſo Cataplaſms made of Barley and Linſeed Flower, boyled in Oyl of Chamomil, applied to the bottom of the Belly are good.</p>
                     <p>As alſo a Cooling Epithem to the Liver, made thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Juyce of Endive and Succory, of each half a pint: the Juyce of Lettice, and Roſe-Vinegar, of each two ounces: mix them and make and Epitheme.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Give Juleps of Poppy, Lettice, Endive, and Sorrel Water, with Syrup of Violets, Apples, and Lemons.</p>
                     <p>If the Pain be urgent, come to Narcoticks.</p>
                     <p>When the pain is mitigated, give the infuſion and expreſſion of Rhubarb in Succory Water with Syrup of Roſes, often, til al the filth be evacuated.</p>
                     <p>If this be too gentle to eradicate the Diſeaſe, give Mercurius Dulcis, which being ſomtimes given with ſome Purging Diagrediats, doth finiſh the Cure.</p>
                     <p>They who are not to take Diagredium, may take Mercurius dulcis alone made into a Pill with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve of Roſes, drinking after it the infuſion of Senna with Rhubarb, adding a little Manna and ſyrup of Roſes.</p>
                     <p>After this you may give your ſharp Vitriolated Waters.</p>
                     <p>When the pain is violent, fly to Baths and Laudanum, to which you may ſomtimes mix Purgers, but in a great quantity; becauſe their force wil be hindered by the Laudanum.</p>
                     <p>Galbanetum Paracelſi, although hot, is fit to diſcuſs the Humor if al the Belly be anointed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: it is deſcribed formerly.</p>
                     <p>Somtimes Blood-letting is good where there is fear of a Feaver by the heat of the blood: and if the Feaver be begun, do it preſently.</p>
                     <p>When there is a great Thirſt, give cold Water. as <hi>Galen</hi> teacheth, lib. 12. meth. cap. 7. And <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Luſitanus</hi> ſaith, That he Cured one preſently with it: And <hi>Septalius</hi> ſhews in Two Stories in the Seventh Book of his <hi>Practical Animadverſions,</hi> That he hath given the ſame, and taken it with very good ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>For the Cure of that Chollick which turneth into a Palſie, after the Belly is looſened with many Clyſters, and the firſt wayes being made open by a Purge, put the Patient into a warm Bath made of an Emollient Decoction, twice, thrice, four, or five times in a day, that the ſharpneſs of the humors may be allaied, and the pores of the Membranes opened.</p>
                     <p>The day after let the Humor be Purged with a fit Medicine; then let him be bathed again, and if his ſtrength wil endure it, let him do it every other day, til the humors are Purged and the pain gone, and the Patient Cured.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time let the Clyſters be continued, eſpecially thoſe made of Milk are beſt to aſſwage pain, to which you may put Caſſia, Oyl of Violets and Lillies.</p>
                     <p>Let the Belly be often anointed with Oyl of Chamomil, Dill, ſweet Almonds, Lillies, or with freſh butter,</p>
                     <p>Then let him uſe Whey and ſharp Waters.</p>
                     <p>And Laſtly, When the Diſeaſe is of long continuance, you may uſe thoſe things which were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed for the Cure of Hypochondriak Melancholly.</p>
                     <p>Nor muſt you omit Phlebotomy from the beginning of the Diſeaſe before Purging, and it muſt be often repeated if the Blood be evil, or the pain come of a Catarrh any wayes.</p>
                     <p>Finally, Al the Medicines mentioned in Chollerick Chollick may here be applied, which if it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail not, ſome Phyſitians uſe this following Potion, which though it be ſorbid and not ſit fot men wel educated, yet they ſay it Cureth preſently.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Horſe-dung one ounce: break it in pieces, and infuſe it in one pint of Poppy-Water with eight or ten drops of spirit of Vitriol: ſtrain it gently, and divide the Liquor into three Doſes, for the time of the violent pain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if it turn into a Palſie, you muſt anoint the Spina or back Bone and the Paralytike parts with a Reſolving and a Nerve Corroborating Balſom if there be no Feaver; but if there be, bind Wool dipt in Oyl, or ſome digeſting Oyntment, to the Paralytike parts, taking heed of Cold, by which the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor wil be faſtned to the parts, and the breathing forth of it hindered.</p>
                     <p>Galbanetum Paracelſi is beſt, if it be applied to the parts aforeſaid, and the Navel.</p>

                        <hi>Chap. 2.</hi> Of the Iliack Paſsion.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>ILEOS,</hi> or <hi>Iliack Paſſion,</hi> took its name (as ſome ſay) from the Gut <hi>Ileum,</hi> which chiefly is Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in this Diſeaſe; although the other thin and ſomtimes thick Guts are capable of the ſame: Or, rather from <hi>Eileſthai,</hi> which ſignifieth to be rowled and girt about; therefore the Latins call it <hi>Volvulus,</hi> or <hi>Convolvulus,</hi> becauſe the Guts in this Diſeaſe ſeem manifeſtly to be rowled about, and to be moved upwards: it is alſo called <hi>Rordapſos,</hi> becauſe the Guts, if you lay your hand on them, ſeem to be like a ſtretched or twiſted cord.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Barbarians</hi> cal it <hi>Miſerere mei,</hi> becauſe it is a miſerable Diſeaſe and commonly deadly, and therefore needs divine Commiſeration.</p>
                     <p>This Iliack Paſſion is a prepoſterous motion of the Inteſtines, in which the Belly is alwayes bound; and the Excrements which ſhould be carried downwards, are brought to the Stomach, and caſt out by vomiting.</p>
                     <p>It is known that the Inteſtines have a natural motion by which the Chylus and Faeces are by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees carried downwards, which is called <hi>Periſtalticus;</hi> this motion is by the Orbicular and Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Fibres which contract the Inteſtines, and is compared to the motion of Earth-worms which move the parts of their bodies ſucceſſively. And this motion is ſomtimes inverted by preternatural Cauſes, as when the Fibres of the Inteſtines which ought to be contracted from above down-wards, are contracted upwards; and whatſoever is in the Guts is not ſent towards the Belly but towards the Stomach, and then is this Iliack Paſſion: We obſerve ſomthing like this in Vomiting; for when the Fibres of the Oeſophagus contract themſelves from the upper part towards the Stomach, the meat is ſwallowed down; but when by an inverted order they contract themſelves from the part beneath up wards, there is vomiting. This Periſtaltick inverted motion comes from the vehement ſtirring up of the Expulſive Faculty of the Guts, which when it cannot throw down-wards the ſuperfluous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious matter, doth by a violent motion caſt it upwards. This motion is ſomtimes ſo violent, that not only Chyle, and Wind, and Excrementitious Humors, but the Faeces alſo, and Excrements which ſhould be ſent out by the Anus are thrown forth by vomiting; So that Clyſters and Suppoſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries alſo are ſnatcht up and vomited out: So <hi>Matthew de Gradi</hi> reports of a Girle of twelve yeers old, who in this Diſeaſe for three dayes together, did not only vomit up Dung and Clyſters, but alſo along Suppoſitory a ſhort time after it was adminiſtred unto her; and when another Suppoſitory was tyed to her Thigh, that was preſently broken off and vomited up with a piece of the Thred at it: And when Thirdly, a Suppoſitory was tyed with four ſtrong Threds as before, that alſo was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off and Vomited up with part of the Threds: And at length when the Mother, as deſired by the Phyſitian, to adminiſter another, it was drawn upward with ſo much violence, that ſhe was conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſuddenly to draw it out leaſt it ſhould be again Vomited up. There are the like ſtories in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, which for brevity ſake we omit.</p>
                     <p>This ſtirring up of the Expulſive Faculty of the Guts comes from divers Cauſes: The chief is Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; therefore whatſoever doth ſo violently obſtruct the Guts that nothing can deſcend, doth beget this Diſeaſe: for after the Faculty hath long labored to throw out ſuperfluities the ordinary way, and is fruſtrate of her intention; deſiring to ſatisfie the neceſſity of excluſion, ſhe takes another Courſe, and by a prepoſterous motion drives them upwards, and vomiteth them out.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes obſtructing are hard Dung long retained, groſs vapors gathered in abundance into the Guts and violently diſtending them; Inflamation, and other great Tumors, which wholly ſhut up the internal Cavities of the Gut, and the circumvolution of it, ſo that it is as it were tied in a knot, which often happeneth in a Hernia or rupture, and alſo in the Chollick, after which often follows this <hi>Ileos,</hi> becauſe the Inteſtines being ſtretched with wind, do rowl together, and ſomtimes knit a knot.</p>
                     <p>The more unuſual cauſes which do ſo provoke the expulſive faculty that are conſtrained to alter their motion, are great Ulcers, or ſharp Humors which twitch the Guts; for when the faeces or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Humors going downwards, do touch the ulcerated part, they ſo prick it that the faculty is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked not to ſuffer ſo noxious a thing to paſs, but driveth it upwards with violence; which motion the other Inteſtines ſtirred up by ſympathy, do follow till the noxious Matter goes to the Stomach, which following the ſame Motion, by the help of the aforeſaid faculty, drives it forth by vomit.</p>
                     <p>The Signs of the Iliack Paſſion are partly Common to thoſe of the Chollick, and partly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
                     <p>The Common Signs are, pain in the Abdomen, ſwelling and puſſing up of the Belly, a bound Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, loathing of Meat, Nauſea, Vomiting, want of Reſt, difficulty of Breathing, and Piſſing.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe which are Proper and peculiar to this Diſeaſe, are a ſharp pain and moſt violent, puſſing up
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:49088:135"/>
and very violent diſtenſion, an eminent hard tumor in the Hypogaſtrium, a total ſuppreſſion of ſeege, ſo that nothing is voided that way. In progreſs of the Diſeaſe, there is irregular vomiting, firſt of Choller, then of Flegm, and Chylous Matter, and at length of dung, or rather of a Matter like it, of corrupt and ſtinking Meat, for the faeces are ſeldom ſent upwards, when they are neer death, there is abundance of cold ſweat, refrigeration of the extream parts, trembling of the Heart, diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance and fainting.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Galen</hi> in Comment. Aph. 10. Sect. 7. affirms that the proper and inſeparable ſign of this Diſeaſe is not to go to ſtool at all. But <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſeems to affirm the contrary, 3. Epid. Sect. 2. Text. 7. in an Hiſtory of a Woman thus affected, which dwelt at <hi>Tiſamen,</hi> ſaying there were thin, few, and crude dejections. To which difficulty we anſwer, That in the beginning of the diſeaſe, ſome ſtools may be from the faeces contained beneath the Gut affected, which by Nature or Art may be excluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the Inteſtines conſent and loſe their proper and Natural faculty. But when the Diſeaſe is confirmed, and the motion of all the Guts is periſtal like and inverted wholly, there is nothing more ſent downward.</p>
                     <p>The ſigns of the Cauſes are theſe: If <hi>Ileos</hi> come from Inflamation (which often happeneth) the Diſeaſe is moſt acute, and comes quickly to the heighth, there is an intenſe feaver, a moſt vehement pain, Chollerick Vomitings and flegmatick do ſoon appear, and faeces and dung do preſently, and other deadly ſigns before mentioned.</p>
                     <p>If it come from the faeces endurable there went before it a conſtriction of the Belly for many daies, and in the beginning there is no pain, but afterwards there is, the Diſeaſe is of longer continuance, nor is it ſo acute as that which comes from Inflamation, neither is the pain ſo great, nor the Feaver ſo ſtrong, and ſomtimes there is none.</p>
                     <p>If it come from wind or flegm, it followeth for the moſt part the Chollick, and ſigns of the Chollick, of flegm and wind went before, which are laid down in the Chapter afore going.</p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſtick. Every <hi>Ileos</hi> is dangerous, but one more than another. That is moſt dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in which firſt there is chollerick, then flegmatick, and after ſtinking vomiting; and <hi>Galen, 6. de loc. aff. cap.</hi> 2. ſaith none of theſe eſcape; but Experience teacheth that ſome do, as when the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe comes from retention of the faeces, or <hi>Hernia Inteſtinalis,</hi> or Rupture in the Guts.</p>
                     <p>They who have this Diſeaſe with the Strangury, die within ſeven daies, except a Feaver coming, the Urine be more plentifully voided. <hi>Hipp.</hi> Aph. 44. Sect. 6. if the Strangury come of thick and and flegmatick Humors which are plentiful in the Veins and Guts, a Feaver coming thereupon, they may be concocted, melted, and attenuated, and piſſed forth, by which means the <hi>Ileos</hi> is cured. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Galen</hi> in his Comment upon this Aphoriſm, ſaith that he is ignorant of what <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith here, and that it cannot be confirmed by Reaſon and Experience.</p>
                     <p>If Symptomes be remitted, and either Medicines or meat taken at the Mouth, paſs through, there is hope of recovery.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of this Diſeaſe, is to be varied according to the difference of the Cauſes. And firſt, if the obſtruction comes from the Faeces indurate, or from groſs and ſlimy flegm, you muſt uſe Emol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lient and Laxative Medicines, both internally and externally.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then, give Clyſters of the Decoction of Althaea, Mallows, Violets, Chamomel, and Melilot, with Lin-ſeed and Foenugreek ſeed, or of common Oyl to a pint, in which you may diſſolve the third part of Butter, or of the Broth of a Sheeps Paunch, in which diſſolve Butter, Honey, and Sal gem. To which Decoction, if there be wind (as commonly there is) it is good to put Carminatives and Diſcuſſers.</p>
                     <p>After the Matter is ſomwhat mollified with theſe Clyſters, you muſt give firſt ſome gentle Purges, then ſtronger, and laſt the ſtrongeſt.</p>
                     <p>In the mean while you muſt apply Fomentations and Liniments that are Emollient, to the whol Belly, and continue them long. The Paunch of a Gelding warmed in hot Water, applied to the Belly, is good; but mollifying Baths are better, eſpecially if they be made of Air only.</p>
                     <p>Alſo you may give inwardly the Oyl of ſweet Almonds either alone with white Wine. To which if the pain be great, you may ad the Syrup of Poppies, as was ſhewed in the Cure of the Chollick.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly, If there be vehement pain, and much flatus, you may give thoſe other Medicines which are preſcribed in the Cure of the Chollick, not omitting Purges, which being opportunely given, take away the Cauſe.</p>
                     <p>That which comes from Inflaruation of the Inteſtines, is to be cured by often Blood-letting, if ſtrength permit, both in the Arm and Foot, and by applying of Cupping-glaſſes with Scarrification to the Groins. Alſo Emollient Clyſters and cooling, are to be given, made thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Althaea Roots two ounces: Mallows and Violets, of each one handful: Guord ſeeds half an ounce: Line and Fleabane ſeeds, of each two drams: Water Lillies and Roſes, of each one pugil: Chamomel Flowers half a pugil: make a Decoction, in a pint whereof diſſolve two ounces of Oyl of Roſes; Caſſia one ounce: make a Clyſter, and in progreſs of time ad Oyl of Violets and Chamomel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="287" facs="tcp:49088:135"/>The aforeſaid Emollients muſt be boyled in Oxycrate.</p>
                     <p>Or give new Milk with a little Sugar, and the white of an Egg, or the Mucilage of Fleabane ſeeds one ounce, to aſſwage pain.</p>
                     <p>Or you may make a Clyſter of Oyl of ſweet Almonds, Barley Cream, ſtrained from the Decoction of it, adding a little freſh Butter and Sugar.</p>
                     <p>A Clyſter may be made of ſimple Oxycrate, and be every day given, which is excellent againſt the Inflamation of the Guts.</p>
                     <p>Anoint with Oyl of Violets, ſweet Almonds, and Chamomel, with Mucilage of Linſeed, Faenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greek ſeed, and Quinces, with Axungia of Hens and Ducks, and ſweet Butter.</p>
                     <p>Alſo make a Fomentation of the Decoction of thoſe Simples which were preſcribed for a Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</p>
                     <p>Alſo Foment in the beginning with Oxycrate, and after let the Simples aforeſaid, be boyled in Oxycrate.</p>
                     <p>And make a Catataplaſm of the reſidence of thoſe things in the Decoction with Barley Meal, Foenugreek, Lin-ſeed, and Butter, with Axungia's and Oyls aforeſaid.</p>
                     <p>Alſo a Bath of warm Water, in which cold and Emollient things have been boyled, is moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient.</p>
                     <p>After bleeding, give two ounces of Oyl of ſweet Almonds to appeaſe pain, and if it be very great uſe Narcoticks.</p>
                     <p>If there be no vomiting, you muſt provoke it with a draught of warm Water with Oyl of Violets, for ſo the upper parts will be purged, and the Humors will be revelled from the part affected. In the whol time of Cure, you muſt give Juleps and Emulſions preſcribed in the Inflamation of the Stomach.</p>
                     <p>Let his Drink be Barley Water: and in the beginning let him abſtain from all Nouriſhment for twenty four hours, that ſome of the Matter may be conſumed; then give him Chicken Broth. This Diſeaſe is to be attended with diligence, for it is for the moſt part deadly.</p>
                     <p>The chief buſineſs in the Cure, is by abſtinency; and this is taken from the example of thoſe that are wounded in the Guts, for they are almoſt famiſhed for forty daies. Therfore let men in this diſeaſe for four or five daies, take only three ſpoonfuls of Broth every day, that vomit may be hindered which doth encreaſe the Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, Food bringeth no comfort to the ſick, for it turneth not to nouriſhment, but is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly corrupted, and the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chyle which goes from the Stomach into the Guts, is mingled with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements retained, and encreaſeth vomiting.</p>
                     <p>He may drink more freely, becauſe it goes more eaſily to the Liver, and it may be fit to oppoſe the Diſeaſe, if it be well tempered Oxycrate, and in a ſmal quantity.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, It comes ſomtimes but ſeldom, from the circumvolution of the Inteſtines; and this is either from Wind, which tottureth them; or from a Hernia called Interocele, or Rupture.</p>
                     <p>That which comes from Wind, is cured by the ſame Medicines which Cure the flatulent Chollick. But if after long uſe of theſe Medicines, the belly will not be opened, but all things taken are vomited up, that there is little hope of health, the laſt Remedy muſt be uſed, which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> propounds 3. <hi>de morbis,</hi> namely, That a pair of Smiths Bellows be applied to the <hi>Anus,</hi> and that they blow into his Belly. Then give an Emollient Clyſter with Troches of Alhandal to bring out the faeces. This is good not only againſt the <hi>Ileos</hi> from contorſion of the Inteſtines, but in that which comes from a grievous obſtruction, for by dilating the Guts it takes away the obſtruction. <hi>Amatus Luſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus, Curat. ult. Cent.</hi> 1. teſtifieth that he cured one deſperate by this means: as alſo <hi>Epiphanius Ferdinandus</hi> in his Phyſical Hiſtories, Hiſt. 74. reports that the ſon of <hi>John Altimar</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> a moſt expert Phyſitian, was ready to die of this Diſeaſe, and taken as it were from the Graves mouth by this means. But <hi>Aurelian</hi> diſalloweth it, becauſe the wind coming from the Bellows may much hurt with its cold. But this may be avoided if the Bellows be filled with wind by the fire.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Paraeus</hi> alſo propounds another unuſual Medicine, by which he boaſteth that he cured many at deaths door, namely, by drinking three pound of Quick-ſilver in Water alone, for with its weight it doth untie the Gut, and open, and ſends down the hard excrements, which Remedy is commended by others, who ſay that it may be taken without harm.</p>
                     <p>But we may wel fear ſo great a quantity, leſt it extinguiſh the Native heat with its coldneſs, and coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate the Blood in the Veins; therefore in a deſperate caſe it is better to give a leſs quantity. Some give two ounces in a rear Egg, and think good to repeat it if the firſt Doſe do not ſucceed well, but you may ſee in our Obſervations, that one ounce hath done well.</p>
                     <p>But when the Illiack Paſſion comes from the Guts falling into the Cods, all the care is to place them right, which muſt be done by the gentle hand of a Chirurgion, long fomenting the part affected, firſt with an Emollient Decoction, and Relaxing Oyls, giving often Emollient and Carminative
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:49088:136"/>
Glyſters, ſo placing the Patient that his Head be low, and his Thighs high, for ſome having been hung by the Heels, were quickly cured.</p>
                     <p>If the Hernia comes with Inflamation of the Inteſtine, it is cured with a fomentation of cold water. If wind ſtretch the Gut, diſcuſs with a Fomentation of Spirit of Wine. See the examples of both Cures in our Obſervations.</p>

It is a Symptome of the Expulſive faculty diminiſhed, or the retentive encreaſed, and it is the cauſe of many diſeaſes; therfore the Excreta and Retenta are reckoned among the ſix things not Natural, which not keeping the Law of Nature, produce divers Diſeaſes, ſo it being bound, ſends vapors to the Head, and produceth Catarrhs, and other Diſeaſes of the Brain, diſturbs the Concoction of the Stomach, and the actions of other parts.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes of this Symptome are many: And firſt, hardneſs of the faeces, and drineſs, are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Effects, but alſo Cauſes of them, becauſe being hard, they are more difficult to be voided, and do leſs provoke the expulſive Faculty. They become dryer and harder chiefly, and ofteneſt from the exceſſive heat of the Liver, which powerfully draws away all the moiſture contained in the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines, and leaves the faeces dry. This is alſo cauſed by violent motion, eſpecially riding: alſo by few Excrements through want of food, or becauſe they have no actimony to prick the Inteſtines, as it happens in cold Meats; and when the Choller doth not go to the Guts, as we obſerve in the Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice. And laſtly, Many diſeaſes of the Guts may cauſe this conſtriction, as a cold and dry Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Tumors, Obſtructions, Numbneſs of the Anus, and Palſey, and many others.</p>
                     <p>The Signs depend upon the knowledg of the Cauſes, which muſt be taken from their proper Fountains.</p>
                     <p>The hot diſtemper of the Liver is to be taken out of its proper Chapter. Alſo Tumors, and other Diſeaſes of the Guts, have their proper Diagnoſis, or ſigns, and ſo the external Cauſes, as little Meat, or coldneſs thereof, riding, and the like, are known by relation of the Patient.</p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſtick: The Conſtriction of the Belly is more or leſs dangerous, according as the Cauſe is greater o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>leſs. For if it come of Inflamation, or other Tumor of the Inteſtines, it is very dangerous: but from other Cauſes leſs. It uſeth to be contumacious and long when it comes from the faeces indurate; and thence come often Chollicks, which return after they have been cured, by reaſon of the new dryneſs of the faeces; as alſo becauſe though the Belly ſeems to have been made ſufficiently ſoluble by purging, and many liquid Excrements are diſcharged, yet there remains ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times many hard Excrements in the Guts, which breed new pains, and cannot be taken out, but by many Clyſters given after Purging.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of this Diſeaſe depends upon taking away the Cauſes, which are to be taken from their proper Chapters. But becauſe it is commonly long, eſpecially when it depends upon a hot diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Liver, and dryneſs of the Guts; and in the mean time the Belly bound brings many incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences. We will ſpeak of its Cure by its ſelf, which is generally done by Emollients, and Laxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives made thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Althaea, or Marſh-mallow, and Lilly Roots, of each two ounces: Mallows, Marſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mallows, Mercury, Violets, and Brank <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſine, of each one handful: Lin-ſeed and Foenugreek of each half an ounce: Annis ſeed one dram and an half: ſweet Prunes three pair: Chamomel and Meltlot flowers, of each one pugil: boyl them to a pint and an half.

                     </p>
                     <p>Alſo twice in a month, or thrice, you may give one pint of common Oyl alone for a Clyſter.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe Nature will grow dull by too much uſe of Clyſters, and at length will never officiate that way; but when ſhe is provoked by one, you muſt endeavor to mollifie the Belly with other means.</p>

                     <p>LIentery is a kind of Flux of the Belly, in which the Meat is quickly ſent through the Belly, as it was taken unchanged. But in the Coeliack Paſſion the Meat comes forth crude, and imperfectly concocted, whence it appears that theſe two Diſeaſes differ only in degrees, ſo that Lientery is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the act aboliſhed, and Coeliack Paſſion to the act diminiſhed. For although the Meat is ſent forth, either altogether unconcocted, or imperfectly concocted, yet theſe Diſeaſes are not to be referred to concoction hurt, but rather to the retention; for they are either il concocted, or not at al, becauſe they are quickly ſent forth, and are not long enough retained to be concocted. Hence it is collected, that though this Diſeaſe bereckoned among the Diſeaſes of the Guts, yet the Stomach is much affected, and ſomtimes more than the Inteſtines: Hence <hi>Galen 6. de loc. aff. cap.</hi> 2. ſaith that a Lientery and Coeliack Paſſion come both by fault of the Stomach and Guts.</p>
                     <p>Many Cauſes of theſe Diſeaſes are propounded by Authors; all which we may refer to three Heads; the cold diſtemper of the Stomach and Liver, the provocation of thoſe ſame parts; and a great debility of the retentive faculty from ſome deadly diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>The cold diſtemper generateth great plenty of flegmatick and glutionous humors, which covers and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> over the wrinkles of the Stomach, ſo that it cannot retain the food. Hence we may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire why <hi>Galen</hi> 6. Aph. 1. doth ſpeak againſt the old Greeks, who called this Diſeaſe <hi>Lienteriam,</hi> or ſmoothneſs of the Inteſtines therefore, becauſe the internal ſuperficies, or the Stomach being made ſmoother, doth not retain the Meat; whereas the Stomach doth not retain the Meat til a perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction be made ſo much by the roughneſs of the inward coat, as by an innate propriety of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ringing. For as we muſt confeſs that the principal cauſe of retent on is the faculty; ſo alſo muſt we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg that the faculty doth want inſtruments fitly diſpoſed, without which it cannot act: and therfore ſince the in ward Tunicle of the Stomach is made rough and wrinkled, that the Meat may be retained in the Stomach, it is no doubt but if that roughneſs be taken away while the wrinkles are filled up with flegm, the retention of the Stomach wil be hurt, ſo that the Food wil ſlip away unconcocted. The like is in the Womb whole inward Tunicle is rough and wrinkled, that it may the better retain the Seed for Conception; but if it be covered with glutinous Humors, it doth not retain, and the Seed preſently comes forth, whence many Women are barren.</p>

Aph. 1. ſaith, That by thoſe ſharp humors there is an Ulcerous Diſpoſition in the Stomach, as the Aphthae, or Thruſh is in the mouth of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
                     <p>The great imbecillity of the Retentive Faculty in great and deadly Diſeaſes often cauſeth a Lien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, as you may ſee in a Dyſentery, which when nature is conquered degenerateth into a Lientery; the Stomach being drawn to conſent with the Guts which are ſo grievouſly affected, and its Faculties being overthrown; ſo alſo in Malignant Feavers there happeneth often a Lientery wherby the broth as ſoon almoſt as taken is caſt forth unconcocted; and the ſame is when Poyſonous and Hurtful things are taken.</p>
                     <p>There is alſo another Cauſe different from the former, which peculiarly makes a Coeliake Paſſion, namely, The Obſtruction of the Meſaraike Veins which hinder the paſlage of the Chylus to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; whence it muſt needs be caſt forth by the Belly, but that this may be, it is neceſſary that al the Meſaraick Veins, or the greateſt part of them be ſtopped, as in Children who have the Struma, or Kings Evil, whoſe Meſentery is found ful of Glandles, by which the Meſaraike Veins are ſtopped: and theſe continually have a Chylous and Coeliake Flux: They eat much and grow leaner til they fal into a Maraſmus.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aetius</hi> and <hi>Celſus,</hi> and many of their followers, do propound another Cauſe of the Lientery, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, A Smooth and Thick Scar in the Guts remaining after a long Dyſentery, by which the mouths of the Veins being ſtopped, the diſtribution of Nouriſhment is hindered, and thence comes a Lientery, which Cauſe we cannot entertain for then al the Guts ſhould have been Ulcerated, and the Scar in them al ſhould ſtop al the meſeraiks which is not agreeable co reaſon: becauſe it is impoſſible that al the Guts ſhould be ulcerated, and the man not die.</p>
                     <p>The chief Signs of theſe Symptomes do appear by what is ſaid, for if crude meat and unchanged deſcend quickly and often through the Guts ſignifieth a Lientery; but if it be ſomewhat changed and ſeem like Chylus; it ſhews a Coeliack Paſſion.</p>
                     <p>The Signs of the Cauſes are thus gathered,</p>
                     <p>If Lientery or Coeliake Paſſion come of a cold diſtemper and Flegmatick humors, there wil be ſowr belchings, the excrements of the belly are Flegmatick, there wil be thirſt and want of pain: if the Flegm come from the Head, as it often doth, the excrements are frothy, and the Flux is greater after ſleep; And there are other Cauſes which alter the Head, and other Signs of a Catarrh.</p>
                     <p>If it come from Irritation, or provocation, there is ſomtimes a gnawing in the Stomach, a heat in the Hypochondria, there is great thirſt, ſharp excrements and chollerick.</p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſtick, Thus,</p>
                     <p>Lientery and Coeliack Paſſion laſting long is dangerous, becauſe it catcheth a way the nouriſhment from the whol body, from whence comes an Atrophy, or a Dropſie: and if it follow great and acute Diſeaſes, it uſeth to be deadly.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of this Diſeaſe is to be altered according to the variety of the Cauſes that produce it.</p>
                     <p>And Firſt,</p>
                     <p>That which cometh from Flegm may be Cured by thoſe Remedies which were propounded for the Cure of Want of Appetite coming of a cold Cauſe; Chuſing thoſe things which are moſt Aſtringent to ſtay the Fux of the Belly.</p>
                     <p>Therefore you muſt begin with Purging of the peccant humor with Medicines made of Aloes, Rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb, and Myrobalans.</p>
                     <p>Clyſters are here of little force, while the Stomach is chiefly diſtempered; except an immoderate Flux do require them: and then they muſt be Aſtringent and ſtrengthening according to the Forms which ſhal be propounded in the following Cures.</p>
                     <p>After Purging ſufficiently you muſt ſtrengthen the Stomach with Opiats, Pouders, Fomentations, Plaiſters, and other Remedies mentioned in the place above quoted, in which (as I ſaid) you muſt not omit Aſtringents, as Maſtich, Citron peels, Coriander ſeeds, Snake-weed Roots, Tormentil, Coral, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And beſides others, the Opiate following which is greatly Commended by <hi>Amatus Luſitanus</hi> is Convenient, by which he ſaith he Cured an Old man, after many other Medicines failed.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Conſerve of old Roſes ſix ounces: of the beſt Treacle ſix drams: Syrup of Quinces as much as will make an Opiate, of which let him take half an ounce in the morning, not drinking pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Dlarrhoea</hi> is that kind of flux of the Belly, by which the excrementitious Humors are ſent forth without Blood or Food, and without the Ulceration of the Inteſtines.</p>
                     <p>By the Conditions of Diarrhoea properly ſo called, is diſtinguiſhed from other kinds of fluxes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in Lientery and Coeliack Paſſion, the Food is caſt forth unconcocted, or half concocted; in a Dyſentery and Teneſmus, Blood is mixed with the Excrements, as in the flux of the Liver, called <hi>Hepaticus,</hi> and in the <hi>Haemorrhoidal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Many are the Differences thereof; which that they may be cleerly explained, are to be referred to three Heads: The firſt whereof reſpects the Matter which is voided; the ſecond the place from whence it comes; the third, the Manner, and efficient Cauſe which produceth the flux of the Belly.</p>
                     <p>In reſpect of the Matter voided, this flux is divided into a Chollerick, Flegmatick, Melanchollick, and ſerous, or watery.</p>
                     <p>In reſpect of the place from whence it comes; either it comes from the whol Body, or ſome peculiar Part, as the Brain, Stomach, Guts, Liver, Spleen, Meſentery, Womb, and other Parts.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, In reſpect of the Manner and Efficient Cauſe; one Diarrhoea is Critical, another Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomatical; one comes from an internal Cauſe, as a diſtemper, or evil diſpoſition of the internal parts; another from an external, as from ſome Medicine or Poyſon.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Differences are ſeldom found ſingle, but they are often complicated in one and the ſame flux. So a Chollerick flux is from the Liver or the whol Body, a Flegmatick from the Brain or Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, a Melanchollick from the Spleen, and a Serous from the whol Body.</p>
                     <p>Alſo theſe Differences are complicated from a divers mixture of Humors, ſo that ſomtimes Chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, Flegm, and Water, are ſent forth by the ſame flux.</p>
                     <p>There is another kind of Diarrhoea different from the reſt, which is called <hi>Syntectice,</hi> or <hi>Colliquati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> coming from the melting away of the ſubſtance of the Body, and Humors by the violent hot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper of the ſolid parts: ſuch as happeneth ſomtimes in the Inflamation of the Bowels, in a ſtrong burning Feaver, hectick, or peſtilential; in which a fat Matter as it were mixed with Oyl or Greaſe is voided.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>Fluxus ſtercoroſus,</hi> or a dungy flux, is another kind, in which much liquid excrement is often voided, which comes from excrementitious Meats corrupted in the Stomach, or a great plenty of Excrements heaped up in the Inteſtines.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="292" facs="tcp:49088:138"/>The Knowledg in general is manifeſt, namely, when more liquid Excrements are voided, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tener than uſually Nature doth allow.</p>
                     <p>The Signs of theſe Differences which are taken from the matter are manifeſt to the Senſes, namely, Whether they be Flegmatick, Melanchollick, Chollerick, or Serous.</p>
                     <p>The Parts Sending have a more difficult Diagnoſis or way of Knowledg, yet they are thus Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed:</p>
                     <p>If the Humors flow from the whol body, there either is, or hath lately been, a continual Feaver, or ſome other diſeaſe of the whol body, as Cachexia, evil Habit, or Leucophlegmatia, or white Dropſie; or there hath been over-eating or drinking, and there is no ſign of any Diſeaſe of any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar part.</p>
                     <p>If it be Critical, it is a benefit to the Patient, and is eaſily endured; and thence the Diſeaſe is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cured, or Diminiſhed.</p>
                     <p>Somtimes there hapneth a Critical Diarrhoea without a Diſeaſe in ſome bodies which uſe to lay up evil Humors; and being ſtrong, do throw them forth at times when they abound and burden nature as <hi>Galen</hi> taught, 7. meth. Cap. 11. of which Flux <hi>Celſus</hi> maketh mention, <hi>lib. 4. cap.</hi> 19. in theſe words, <hi>It is healthful for to go often to the Stool in one day, and in many dayes together if there be a Feaver, and if it ceaſe before the ſeventh day; for the Body is purged, and that which inwardly would have hurt, is now ſent forth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Among Critical Fluxes, the Serous is one; which comes without a Diſeaſe aforegoing; in them who have much Water in their Veins, and that chiefly in the Harveſt time, or Autumne: namely, when the night and morning cold of Autumne, finding the paſſages external and pores of the skin o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, by reaſon of the heat of Summer aforegoing doth therefore inſinuate it ſelf deeper into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, preſſing forth internally the Serous Humors contained in the Veins, which Nature afterwards being over-burdened with, ſends by the Meſeraick Veins into the Inteſtines, and many times into the Uriters.</p>
                     <p>Hence it is that many in the beginning of Autumne, and in the firſt cold weather, do make abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Urine for many dayes together.</p>
                     <p>But if a Diarrhoea be Symptomatical, it troubles the patient much, and weakeneth him; and the Diſeaſe upon which it comes, is encreaſed; or at leaſt is in the ſame ſtate.</p>
                     <p>This Symptomatical Flux in burning Feavers and Malignant, is often melting; and hence it is known, becauſe the Excrements appear unctious, and the body forthwith becomes lean, and conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and almoſt in a Maraſmus.</p>
                     <p>If the Diarrhoea comes from the Brain, the Stools are frothy, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> taught, Aphor. 30. Sect. 7. which is not alwaies ſo; For Flegm may flow from the brain without Wind, which is the only cauſe of froth: as alſo Wind may be mixed with Humors that are bred or contained in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach or inteſtines, from whence the Excrements may be frothy, though they come not from the Head.</p>
                     <p>Therefore we muſt joyn other Signs to this, namely, If the Brain have any manifeſt Diſeaſe, as a Catarrh, Deafneſs, Lethargy, Apoplexy, or great Heavineſs, Pain, or Sleepineſs; and if the Flux be more at night than day.</p>
                     <p>If it come from the fault of the Stomach, there wil be the Signs of the Concoction of the Stomach Hurt: As if the Food be corrupted, and have a ſharp and ſtinking quality, by which the Expulſive Faculty is ſtirred up to expel them.</p>
                     <p>Alſo there wil then be the Signs of a Hot Diſtemper of the Stomach: So, if the Stools be Crude and Flegmatick, and if Concoction be ſlow and diminiſhed, we argue that the Concoction of the Stomach is hurt by a cold Diſtemper: and laſtly we know that the fault is in the Stomach, if the Patient did before fill himſelf with evil Food which would eaſily corrupt.</p>
                     <p>The Flux of the Belly comes from the Guts, when they are ful of Worms, and then there wil be ſigns of Worms which you may take from their proper Chapters.</p>
                     <p>If from the Liver, The Stools wil be Chollerick, becauſe Choller is bred there; and there wil be Signs of a Hot Diſtemper, Inflamation, Obſtruction, and other Diſeaſes of the Liver.</p>
                     <p>If from the Spleen, The Stools wil be commonly black or blackiſh, a diſtention in the left Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondrion, a heavineſs alſo or pain there, and other ſigns of the Spleen Diſtempered wil ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
                     <p>If from the Meſentery, There wil be extenſion, ſtretching, or pain in that part: But Humors gathered in the Meſentery, come commonly from the Liver and Spleen.</p>
                     <p>If from the Womb, There wil be ſtoppage of the Courſes, or the Symptomes of the Womb af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, which uſe to be more violent, and the Flux alſo at that time when the Terms ought to flow.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="293" facs="tcp:49088:138"/>The Prognoſtick of a Diarrhoea is made thus,</p>
                     <p>A Flux of the Belly which is eaſily endured, and in which the Patient finds refreſhment, is good: On the contrary, that which is painful and weakneth, is evil: The firſt is to be accounted Critical, the laſt Symptomatical.</p>
                     <p>When the Liquid Excrements grow thicker, it is good: For it ſignifieth, That the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Worketh well by Concocting of evil Humors: which is done by making them thick.</p>
                     <p>Thin Excrements with pain often voided are evil, for they ſignifie great ſharpneſs of Humors which do violently pul, ſtimulate, prick, and gnaw the Guts.</p>
                     <p>Liquid Stools without Feeling when they are voided, are evil: For they either ſignifie Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of Mind, or Doting, or Diſſolution of the Natural Heat, which is followed by the loſs of Senſe.</p>
                     <p>Liquid Stools beginning with an acute Diſeaſe, and continuing with the ſame, is evil: for it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies great plenty of Matter, or an evil quality therein, which forceth Nature to ſo ſudden a flux.</p>
                     <p>If a ſtrong Diarrhoea comes upon him who hath the Leucophlegmatia, it cauſeth recovery, <hi>Hipp.</hi> Aph. 29. Sect. 7. For there is an Evacuation of the Matter, which was in the whol Body. But this wants a limitation. The Aphoriſm is true, if this flux happen in the beginning of a Diſeaſe while the ſtrength is good; otherwiſe it doth not take away the diſeaſe, but the Patient.</p>
                     <p>If a Woman with Child have a flux of the Belly, ſhe is in danger to miſcarry; <hi>Hipp.</hi> Aph. 34. Sect. 5. For the food which ſhould nouriſh the Infant, is for the moſt part carried away, and the ſtrength is abated; as alſo the Ligaments of the Womb are relaxed by a continual flux of Humors thither; as alſo the Child and the Womb are infected by the vapor of thoſe excrements which are continually voided.</p>
                     <p>Yellow Stools like Yolks of Eggs; green, like Verdegreece; livid, black, of divers colors, or very ſtinking, are evil: For the reaſon which we gave in the Chapter of Vomiting.</p>
                     <p>As to the Cure: Since a Symptomatical Diarrhoea comes commonly from corrupt Humors, Chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick, Flegmatick, Melanchollick, or Serous, and eſpecially from Chollerick, which provoke the expulſive faculty of the Inteſtines by their ſharpneſs. You muſt begin the Cure by Evacuation of the Humor offending, which muſt be done by a Medicine which doth aſtringe by purging, leſt that flux ſhould be encreaſed by motion of the Humors; and you may make it thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the beſt Rhubarb one dram: Citrine Myrobalans half a dram: Yellow Sanders half a ſcruple: Infuſe them in Plantane Water, diſſolve in the Liquor ſtrained half a dram: the pouder of Rhubarb, and one ounce of Syrup of Roſes. Make a Potion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You may ad Diacatholicon, or other Medicines, according to the condition of the Humor to be purged.</p>
                     <p>Alſo Vomiting is ſomtimes good, becauſe it Revelleth and Evacuateth the Matter of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.</p>
                     <p>If there be ſigns of blood abounding, and ſtrength, you muſt firſt let blood. And if there be a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, you muſt open a Vein, though there appear no Plethory, or fulneſs.</p>
                     <p>Before and after Purging, give clenſing Clyſters, ſuch as theſe:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>whol Barley two pugils: Bran and red Roſes, of each one pugil: Liquoris ſcraped, and Raiſons whol, of each one ounce: boyl them to a pint: Diſſolve in the ſtraining of white Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar one ounce; Yolks of Eggs two. Make a Clyſter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After the Body is ſufficiently emptyed, you muſt give aſtringents, and ſtrengtheners, both at the Mouth, and by Clyſters, as alſo to the Belly; the Forms whereof you may take out of the Cure of Dyſentery.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, You may conveniently uſe theſe that follow:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Chalybeat Vinegar one part: Chalybeat Water two parts: the Leaves and Fruit of Myrtles, Quinces, Medlars, Cervices, of each two handfuls: Cypreſs Nuts ſix pair, boyl to halfs. Foment the Belly warm with the ſtrained Liquor often.</hi>

We alſo once preſcribed to a Sanguine man who was troubled with a Chollerick Diarrhoea in the midſt of Summer with great thirſt, Sal Prunella in his ordinary drink, and Juleps made of Lettice and Purſlain Water to be taken thrice in a day, and he was cured in twenty four hours.</p>
                     <p>If the Humor be very ſharp, and aduſt or burnt, the Patient muſt be purged ſparingly with mild Medicines, otherwiſe the Diſeaſe will encreaſe, and he is to be cooled and moiſtened; as alſo to be blooded a little.</p>
                     <p>In the ſame caſe a warm Bath is very good; the Example whereof is in our Obſervations.</p>
                     <p>Plantane boyled in Broth, is excellent.</p>
                     <p>And leaſt a Diarrhoea turn into a Dyſentery, you muſt give Clyſters of Chalybeate Milk, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulſions of the cold Seeds, and of white Poppy Seeds, to aſſwage the ſharpneſs of the Humor.</p>
                     <p>As alſo this Syrup following.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Juyce of Quinces ſix ounces: the Juyce of Endive and Sorrel, of each three ounces: Sorrel and Plantane Seeds, of each two drams: red Coral one dram: Plantane Water four oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: Boyl them to the Conſumption of half: ſtrain and preſs them well; put to it as much Sugar to make a Syrup to be taken two drams firſt and laſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In al Diarrhoea's, after univerſal Medicines, this following Bolus is good.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Conſerve of old Roſes half an ounce: Candied Quinces one dram: the pouder of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentil one ſcruple: With Sugar make a Bolus to be often repeated. Or if the Diſeaſe be old you may make an Opiate of the ſame, or the like, in a greater quantity to be taken at many times.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or to aſtringe more powerfully give this Pouder:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Sanguis Draconis, Frankinſence, Maſtich, Mummy, Terra Sigillata, Lapis Haematitis, or Blood-ſtone, Troches of Amber, of each one dram: true Bole three drams: make a Pouder, of which give two drams inconvenient Liquor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Rhubarb twice infuſed, and then twice or thrice waſhed in Roſe Water and dried, is good.</p>
                     <p>The Lozenges of the three Sanders, with four times the quantity of Rhubarb given twice in a day, the weight of two drams, do take away the Matter, and ſtrengthen the Bowels.</p>
                     <p>The Leaves of Fleabane laid upon fire ſo that the ſmoak may be taken through a hollow Chair, do ſtop the flux of the Belly by a ſpecifical quality. As alſo if the ſame Herb be beaten with Vinegar, and applied to the Stomach.</p>
                     <p>Alſo the ſmoak of Mullin taken through a hollow Chair, is excellent; the example of which is in our Obſervations.</p>
                     <p>Syrup of Coral is excellent, and much more the Tincture or Magiſtery of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>The Conſerve of the wild Roſe, or ſweet Bryar Roſe, is good againſt a Chollerick flux, eſpecially if it be mixed in aſtringent Opiates.</p>
                     <p>But when there is danger of weakneſs through a long and often flux, you may give Laudanum with Maſtich and Terra Sigillata.</p>
                     <p>When it is very violent, a Clyſter of Broth and new Treacle is excellent.</p>
                     <p>Pils of Bdellium taken twice or thrice in a week, or every other day, are good againſt al old fluxes.</p>
                     <p>For the ſame is the often uſe of Medlars; as <hi>Foreſtus</hi> confirms by experience, obſ. 1. lib. 22. in theſe words: <hi>One that had a conſtant Flux, and spent all he had upon Phyſitians, came to me for coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, whom I adviſed to eat Medlars, though green, as many as he could, by which he was ſpeedily cured. As it was with a Zeland Merchant that came to</hi> John Spirinchius, <hi>a Phyſitian of</hi> Lovan, <hi>who having been long ſick, and of a Dyſentery at laſt, and could not be cured by any, was at length by his advice cured only with Medlars, and gave the Phyſitian three hundred Crowns for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</hi> Thus Foreſtus.</p>
                     <p>But we muſt obſerve that the Body before the uſe of Medlars be clenſed from Excrements.</p>
                     <p>In an old Diarrhoea, the following Medicines are excellent:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the ſhavings of Ivory three drams: Confection Alkermes one dram: Sugar diſſolved in Roſe Water four ounces. Make Lozenges.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Crocus Martis ſix grains: Bezoard Mineral half a ſcruple: Conſerve of Roſes two drams: Spirit of Vitriol three drops: Mix them in a Bolus to be given twice a day, long after and before Meat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Juyce of Perſicaria Maculata, and of the great Houſleek, of each three ounces: boyl them till the third part be conſumed, and give them in the morning, they do certainly cure any flux though very old.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mercurius Diaphoreticus</hi> given ſome daies together, twelve grains at a time, taketh away all the impurities of the Body, which uſe to beget fluxes.</p>
                     <p>The Decoction of Juniper Berries in Wine given three daies together, is good; and alſo one dram of the Pouder of Graſhoppers given in white Wine. Theſe two by deriving the Matter of the flux to the Ureters.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="295" facs="tcp:49088:139"/>The Decoction of Juniper is thus made:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Juniper Berries one handful: red Wine one pint and an half: boyl them to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of two thirds. Let him take the ſtraining three daies together.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Water of Brimſtone Mines cure an old Diarrhoea by purging the whol Body, and by ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening the Stomach. Of which ther is an example in our obſervations.</p>
                     <p>If a Diarrhoea come from a Catarrh, you muſt look to the Brain, as the part that ſends it, with the Medicines preſcribed in the Cure of a Catarrh. But if it depend upon the Obſtruction or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Liver or Spleen, you muſt cure them as ſhal be ſhewed in their proper places; and then there is little or no uſe of aſtringents. <hi>Platerus</hi> in the Cure of the Hemorrhoids, ſaith that hot blood given as a Clyſter, doth wonderfully cure a flux.</p>

                        <hi>Chap. 6.</hi> Of <hi>Dyſenteria,</hi> or Dyſentery.</head>
                     <p>A Dyſentery is an often and bloody looſneſs of the Belly, with pain and torment depending upon the ulceration of the Inteſtines.</p>
                     <p>The word <hi>Dyſenteria</hi> is taken commonly among the Antients for every bloody flux of the Belly: but ſtrictly and properly it is taken only for the bloody flux, which comes from an Ulcer in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. de ſymp. cauſ. cap. 2. nameth four kinds of bloody fluxes, which he commonly calls Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteries.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is when any part of the Body is cut, or when any exerciſe is omitted, or any bleeding is omitted, as uſual bleeding at the Noſe and Haemorrhoids, that by reaſon whereof the blood aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is ſent by the Meſeraick Veins to the Inteſtines, and ſo evacuated by the Belly.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is, when by reaſon of the weakneſs of the Liver, Watery blood like that water wherein fleſh hath been waſhed, is voided; as it is in the Hepatick or flux of the Liver, of which we ſhal hereafter ſpeak.</p>
                     <p>The third is when Melanchollick and ſhining blood is caſt forth, which by reaſon of the long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in the Liver or Spleen is burnt, and mixed with Melancholly. Shining ſignifieth burning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe blood which groweth black by cold doth not ſhine, but loſeth that brightneſs or ſplendor which it had before.</p>
                     <p>The fourth Difference, is when the Patient at ſome ſhort diſtance voids blood with Humors or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, with which ſomtimes there is mixed Pus or Matter, and that with pain and torment, by which we may conclude that there is an Ulcer of the Guts. And this is properly called a Dyſentery, of which only we here diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>The Internal Cauſes of a Dyſentery, are ſharp and ulcerating Humors, as yellow Choller, green like Leeks or Verdegreece, and black; as alſo ſalt flegm bred in the Head from great heat, or in the Belly by putrefaction, and ſo brought to the Inteſtines, where cleaving a long time, it doth ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerate.</p>
                     <p>Here is a great Doubt propounded by Authors; How yellow Choller in a ſhort time ſhould cauſe a Dyſentery? When green Choller in a long time maketh only a Diarrhoea, which never turneth into a Dyſentery, ſince the green is made of the yellow by aduſtion, and hath more ſharpneſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mercatus</hi> anſwereth, That there muſt be a clammineſs, by which it may remain long in the Guts to corrode and gnaw them, as wel as a ſharpneſs. And therefore if yellow Choller be ſuch, it cauſeth a Dyſentery; on the contrary, if green Choller be more fluid, and ſtay leſs while in the Guts, it makes but a ſimple Diarrhoea.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sennertus</hi> ſaith that this anſwer is probable; but it doth not ſatisfie, becauſe oftentimes there are fluxes, in which there is clammineſs with ſharpneſs, and yet there is no Dyſentery. And contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, often times there is no clammineſs in Chollerick Humors which cauſe a Dyſentery, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he thinks that the Humors which produce a Dyſentery have a peculiar occult quality, with which the Inteſtines are offended and ulcerated, as the Lungs are with the fiſh Lepus, and the Bladder with Cantharides, and no other part. And he proveth that malignant quality in that a Dyſentery is conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious for the moſt part, ſo that the infections which come from the vapors riſing from the excrements of thoſe that have a Dyſentery, do only infect the Guts of them that are infected, and not upon other parts. The ſame happeneth in other Epidemical and infectious Diſeaſes, in which the poyſon doth go only to ſome peculiar part; ſo their Pleureſies, Peripneumonia's, or Impoſthumes in the Lungs, and Squinzies which are infectious. So the Poyſon of a mad Dog doth only infect the Head. This is more cleer to be ſeen in Purging Medicines, which have a peculiar vertue to move the Humors in the Body, and bring them to the Guts, which wil not only, being taken at the Mouth, purge by ſtool, but laid to the Navil are taken by vapor at the Noſe; it is probable that they piercing into the Veins and
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:49088:140"/>
Arteries by the Pores of the Skin and extremities of the Veſſels, do ſtir up motion, and Fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or working in the Humors, becauſe the bad Humors are ſeparated from the good, and by pricking or ſtimulating of Nature, they are driven to the Inteſtines by the force of the Medicine, directing the expulſive faculty to thoſe parts. By the ſame reaſon, but after another manner, do Sudoriſicks, or Sweating Medicines, and Diureticks, or ſuch as provoke Urine work; the former forcing the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors to the Skin, the latter to the Bladder. From which we may collect that the inſection of a Dyſentery, by what manner or part ſoever it is admitted into the Body, doth cauſe a certain fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation or working in the Humors by giving them a Diſpoſition like it ſelf; which being an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the Guts, doth provoke the flux of the Humors to them, by which they are ulcerated; and they being infected with the like diſpoſition, do infect the Humors and Nouriſhment; from whence comes a true and proper Dyſentery.</p>
                     <p>It is demanded of divers Authors, What is that ſnotty and white Matter which is voided in ſuch great plenty in Dyſenteries, mixed with Blood and other Humors? Some think that it is the fat of the Guts; others that it is that with which the Inteſtines are lined for the better paſſage of the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; others, that it is flegm from the Head or other parts; others, that it is Pus or Matter from the Ulcers. But we conclude, That it is nothing elſe but a preternatural excrement of the Guts; for they being decayed from their Natural Conſtitution, cannot convert their proper Nouriſhment into their own ſubſtance, but by an imperfect way change it into that Matter; which when it is unfit for nouriſhment of thoſe parts, is expelled forth, and then the parts wanting again Nouriſhment, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracteth or draweth new, which is changed as the former, and there muſt needs be a great encreaſe thereof, becauſe the part affected continually draweth Blood from the Veins, which is changed into this ſlimy ſubſtance, by which it is deceived of its expectation, and therefore again draweth new for its Nouriſhment, which it continually aimeth at, but cannot turn into its own ſubſtance, but into th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> ſlimy Matter, of which there is ſo great an encreaſe. The ſame thing is done in other parts, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in great and profound or deep Ulcers. For the part Ulcerated when by reaſon of its evil diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, it cannot be wel nouriſhed, draws blood continually from the Veins, which is changed into Pus or Quittor, by which means the whol body by degrees conſumeth. Nor doth this befal only parts ulcerated, but others that have no Ulcer or Impoſthume; ſo that although the aforeſaid Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement be like Quitt r, yet is not true Pus or Quittor; for that comes only from an Ulcer or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſthume. This chiefly appears in an Ophthalmy or Inflamation of the Eyes, in which when there is no Ulcer or Impoſthume, there is a continual Excrement like Quittor, which comes only from the diſtemper of the part, and the depravation of the Homioſis, or quality by which it makes Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment like it ſelf. The ſame befals men in Aſthma or Ptiſick, and other Diſeaſes of the Lungs, for their Lungs being diſtempered, do il concoct their own Nouriſhment, but turn it into an Excrement like Quittor, which is expelled by coughing, and yet they have no Ulcer in their Lungs; as many learned Phyſitians wil conclude when they ſee the Matter.</p>
                     <p>The External Cauſes of a Dyſentery, are al things that produce ſharp and evil Humors, or give them being produced, a diſpoſition to cauſe a Dyſentery. The Principal are, ſharp Meats, or very ſubject to putrefaction, as Fruits ſoon rotten, and al unripe things, Waters that are drunk ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, wherein there is Crudity or a Mineral, and Medicines which are deadly qualified, and evil Air, as <hi>Hipp.</hi> Aph. 11. Sect. 3. when the Winter is too cold or dry, the Spring too wet, and too full of South winds, then there wil be Dyſenteries in the Summer. And Aph. 12. Sect. 3. If the South wind blow much in Winter, and it rain much: but if it be dry, and the North wind blow much, in the Spring, thoſe ſeaſons produce Dyſenteries.</p>
                     <p>But the proper Diſtemper of the Air to produce a Dyſentery is known in a contagious or Epidemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Dyſentery, which ſomtimes is more dangerous then others. As alſo there is an Infection in the Excrements of thoſe that have this Diſeaſe to them that ſmel them, and if th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y be caſt into the Privy they infect moſt of the Family that ſit over them.</p>
                     <p>The Signs of a Dyſentery are taken out of the Definition mentioned, an often bloody Evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with pain and torments of the Belly, and ſomtimes a Feaver, watching, thirſt, loathing of Meat and other Signs common to many Diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>But it is hard to know whether the thick or thin Guts are ulcerated. Uſually if the pain be above the Navil, they ſay it is in the thin Guts, and if below, in the thick; but this is contrary to reaſon, becauſe both the thin and thick Guts are carried both to the ſuperior and inferior parts. Therefore this ſign is rather to be taken from the quality of the pain, and the excrements. For if the thin Guts are affected, there is vehement pain, like pins pricking, becauſe they are more Membranous, and of more exquiſite ſence. As alſo they go not to ſtool preſently after the pain, and there is blood in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſtool; for becauſe the Blood and purulent Matter comes far before it be voided, it is more mixed with the Dung; but if the thick Guts are affected, the pain is leſs vehement and laſting, there is preſently after a going to ſtool, the Blood and Matter ſwim upon the excrement, or are very little mixed, and in a great Ulceration there are as it were little pieces of fleſh.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="297" facs="tcp:49088:140"/>The Signs of the Cauſes are taken eſpecially from the Colour of the Excrements, when they are yellow, green, white, or black, to which you may ad the Signs of Humors abounding from the Age, Temperament, time of the yeer, and courſe of Life.</p>
                     <p>The Prognoſtick is thus made,</p>
                     <p>If the Thin Guts are Ulcerated there is more danger, for they are more Nervous, and being neerer the Liver they receive more pure Choller.</p>
                     <p>Dyſenteries coming from black Choller, or Melancholly, are deadly; <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> aph. 24. ſect. 4. becauſe the Ulcer grows Cancerous, which is ſeldom Cured outwardly in the body. But if this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly comes by Criſis, of Judgement, it is not ſo dangerous. But you muſt beware leaſt you take Congealed blood for Melancholly.</p>
                     <p>A Dyſentery from Choller or ſharp Diet is eaſily Cured: from ſalt Flegm it is worſe than from Choller, becauſe by reaſon of the Clammineſs it ſtayes longer in the Guts to ulcerate.</p>
                     <p>In long Diſeaſes of the Guts, Loathing of Meat is evil, and worſe with a Feaver: <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> Aph. 3. Sect. 6.</p>
                     <p>If in a Dyſentery there be as it were little pieces of Fleſh voided, it is deadly: Aphor. 26. Sect. 4. for it ſignifieth a deep Ulcer which takes away pieces of the guts.</p>
                     <p>Much Watching, Stools without mixture of Humors, black, ſtinking, much blood, a Lientery coming after, Hickets, Chollerick Vomits, pain of the Liver, Midriff, great thirſt, do commonly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that it is deadly.</p>
                     <p>A Dyſentery coming to thoſe which have the Gout or a Diſeaſe in the Spleen, is good: <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> 2. progn. &amp; aph. 46. ſect. 6. but this is rather a ſimple Diarrhoea which ſends forth the matter of thoſe Diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>Old Men and Children more commonly in this Diſeaſe than Men of middle Age, <hi>Hipp. 2. progn</hi> Children becauſe of their tenderneſs, and their not obſerving rules: Old Men becauſe their ſtrength is ſpent, and becauſe there is a great overthrow of their natural ſtate thereby: for they do not eaſily produce excrements that are fit to cauſe a Dyſentery.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of this Diſeaſe is wrought by Medicines that aſſwage, clenſe, and evacuate ſharp humors that Conſolidate and dry Ulcers and ſtop the flux.</p>
                     <p>At firſt you muſt evacuate the Humor offending leaſt it do more miſchief, and you muſt Purge often; and it you think it not ſafe to purge every day or every other day, do it every third or fourth day: Rhubarb is the beſt for purpoſe, either given in ſubſtance with Broth, or made into a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as in Diarrhoea, Or thus,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Plantane half an handful: Liquoris ſcraped, and whole Raiſons, of each three drams<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Red Roſes one pugil: Tamarinds ſix drams: yellow Myrobalans rub'd with Oyl of ſweet Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, two drams: boyl them to three ounces: Diſſolve in the ſtraining, of Rhubarb infuſed with Lavender in Plantane Water one dram: Syrup of Quinces one ounce: Make a Potion:</hi> Or,</p>

                     <p>Many give Parched or Torrified Rhubarb, that the Purging Quality may partly be taken away: But <hi>Amatus Luſitanus</hi> takes the ſecond Infuſion of Rhubarb, and ſaith, That in the firſt Infuſion al his ſharpneſs is taken away, and it is better ſo than Parched, for by ſo doing it is burnt.</p>
                     <p>The Preparation is thus made:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Rhubarb one dram and an half: infuſe it in three ounces of Plantane Water ſome few hours, ſtrain it, preſs it gently, and then infuſe it again in three ounces of new Plantane Water, and diſſolve in the ſtraining half an ounce of Caſſia: make a Potion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If you deſire, by reaſon of the abundance of crude Humors, to Purge more, then you may make Syrup of Roſes, or Diacatholicon, or other mild things, but beware of ſtrong.</p>

                     <p>There is great Diſſention among Authors concerning Blood-letting in this Diſeaſe. And it is the Opinion of the wiſeſt, that in a Feaver and Inflamation of the Inteſtines (which is commonly joyned with an Ulcer) that it ought to be in the beginning of the Diſeaſe, before the ſtrength be decayed by it: for ſo there is a revulſion of Blood, and ſharp Humors flowing to the Guts. And <hi>Valeſcus de Taranta,</hi> and <hi>Amatus Luſitanus</hi> in an old Dyſentery drew Blood. <hi>Valeſcus</hi> ſaith, <hi>That a very old man had a Dyſentery three months; I being ſent for, when other Phyſitians oppoſed it, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a Vein to be opened, he preſently amended.</hi> And <hi>Amatus</hi> ſaith thus; <hi>That an honeſt Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian went to a man, who had a Dyſentery thirty daies with a great Feaver, and after the uſe of divers Medicines was brought very low, and lean, his flux continuing with much Blood, and drew Blood from the Liver Vein of his right Arm: and obſerve with what ſucceſs; Preſently, miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly the blood ſtopped, though his flux continued.

                     </p>
                     <p>In the mean while give many Clyſters, firſt aſſwaging, mild, and clenſing; then glutinous and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringent; and ſomtimes in one Clyſter all together, or moſt of them.</p>
                     <p>Mild, gently, and anodine Clyſters that aſſwage pain, are made of Milk, either alone, or with two or three yolks of Eggs, or with the Mucilage of Fleabane Seeds and Quinces, of each four ounces; with Sugar or Honey of Roſes one ounce; Goats Suet one ounce; or with Milk wherein Gold, Iron, or Flints have been quenched, that the ſerous part may be conſumed, and ſo it may be more glutinous.</p>
                     <p>In want of Milk, you may give Almond Milk, or Barley Cream, or Rice Milk, alone or together; as alſo the Broth of Mutton, Chicken, Capon, or a Sheeps Head, and mix the former things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. It is uſual to boyl Roſes, and the Herb Horſ-tail with a Sheeps Head. Or this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Marſh-mallow Roots one ounce: clenſed Barley, or Rice one Pugil: Lin-ſeed and Quince ſeed, of each one ounce: Fleabane ſeed half a dram: Chamomel flowers one pugil: Boyl them in Milk or Broth, adding the Suet and Yolks of Eggs, and other things before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</hi>

                     <p>Or you may make it of Milk alone, boyled with Marſh-mallow Roots at the firſt, to clenſe and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage the pain.</p>
                     <p>If the Pain be great, you muſt mix Narcoticks; as Philonium Perſicum, one or two drams: Pils of Hounds-tongue one or two ſcruples: Syrup of Poppies one ounce and an half: Laudanum five or ſix grains, in your Clyſters.</p>
                     <p>If there be an Inflamation in the Guts, which may be known by conſtant pain, and increaſing when it is touched, alſo by a Feaver and dryneſs of the Tongue; let blood again, give Clyſters of Roſe Water, with Salt of Lead, and foment the Belly with Oxycrate, or Wine and Water.</p>
                     <p>Alſo you may give Salt of Lead at the Mouth to ten grains, with Conſerve of Roſes.</p>
                     <p>Clenſing Clyſters are made of Barley Water, Bran, red Roſes, Sugar or Honey of Roſes.</p>
                     <p>But for the greater clenſing and glutinating the Ulcer, ad one dram of Turpentine diſſolved with the Yolk of an Egg. When the Ulcer is more foul, you muſt uſe greater clenſers, as Beets, Pellitory of the wal in the aforeſaid Decoction. The ſtrongeſt Clenſers are, Centaury, Wormwood, Gentian, Brine or Pickle, from <hi>Galen</hi> 12. Meth. Cap. 1. and the like; the uſe of which is now very rare.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Zacutus Lucitanus</hi> durſt uſe Arſenick, and yet with good ſucceſs; as you may ſee Obſ. 18. Lib. 2. of his Admirable Practice of Phyſick.</p>
                     <p>Some Chymicks uſe of the Oyl of Wax in Clyſters one dram; and anoint the Belly with the ſame.</p>
                     <p>To glutinate or heal up the Ulcer, firſt uſe gently Dryers in Clyſters, and a little aſtringent; then

ſuch as are more drying and binding. Therefore make them firſt of Chalybeat Milk, in which Roſes have been boyled, or of Barley Water, or Water of parched Rice, and red Roſes one pugil, adding to both Clyſters two Yolks of roaſted Eggs, ſomtimes Honey of Roſes; and when you will have it work better, one ounce of the Juyce of Plantane.</p>
                     <p>To bind and glutinate more, make it thus:</p>

Make a Clyſter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Snakeweed Roots, or Tormentil, one ounce and an half: Shepheards-purſe, Knot-graſs, Horſtail, and Mouſear, of each one handful: Pomegranate flowers, Acorn cups, Cypreſs Nuts, of each two drams: parched Rice one pugil: make a Dcoction in Forge Water: in a pint of the ſtraining diſſolve two ounces of the Juyce of Plantane, and two Yolks of roaſted Eggs. Make a Clyſter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Angelus ſala</hi> wonderfully commends the following Clyſter:</p>

                        <hi>Boyl a Sheeps Head cloven in two, till the fleſh come from the bones, add to the Broth ſtrained of the tops of St. Johns Wort two or three handfuls; Tormentil Roots groſly bruiſed two ounces: Infuſe them three or four hours upon the Embers. Let the ſtraining be twice or thrice given as a Clyſter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Juyce of Plantane alone, or with the Milk or Barley Water, is good.</p>
                     <p>Gum Traganth two drams, or the Infuſion of it in Roſe or Plantane Water, is good to put in Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; or it makes a very good one if it be mixed with Juyce of Plantane and Goats Suet inſtead of Gum Traganth. Or with it you may with profit uſe Gum Arabick, Frankinſence, Maſtich, and Sarcocol. All which being diſſolved in the aforeſaid Liquors, do work by glewing, neither do they exaſperate the Ulcer as the ſtrong Aſtringents. <hi>Ama<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>us Lucitanus</hi> doth much approve Clyſters made of them, becauſe they do cover, as with a Plaiſter, the internal Superficies of the Guts againſt the gnawing of the Matter; he makes them thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Barley Water ten ounces: one white of an Egg well beaten: Gum Arabick and Goats Greaſe, of each half an ounce: Oyl of Roſes two ounces: Bole-Armenick and Gum Traganth, of each one dram: mix them for a Clyſter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But leſt thoſe Emplaſtick Clyſters ſhould faſten the ſharp Matter, and ſhut it up by their clammi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, you muſt uſe clenſing Clyſters alſo, which muſt not be long retained; and you muſt ſomtimes uſe clenſing Clyſters intermixed with aſtringent.</p>
                     <p>In the aſtringent you may put Acacia, Hypociſtis, or Conſerve of Sloes, Sanguis Draconis, Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, the Juyce of Maddir taken out with Roſe or Plantane Water, Bole Armenick, Terra Sigillata, or ſealed Earth, the Troches of Amber, and the white Troches of <hi>Rhaſis</hi> to one or two drams. Other Pouders are hurtful, becauſe they ſettle in the Liquor, and provoke the part to pain.</p>
                     <p>And it is better to infuſe the aforeſaid Pouders in Liquor, or in a Decoction, and to give them ſtrained.</p>
                     <p>While you give Clyſters, you muſt give at the Mouth, Medicines of the ſame Nature, and that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tener when the upper Guts are ulcerated, to which the Clyſters cannot reach.</p>
                     <p>If there be no Feaver, you may profitably, when you intend to clenſe, give Goats Milk; and when you intend to glurinate, Cows Milk, both with Sugar of Roſes. But Chalybeat Milk, that is, Steel infuſed, doth knit or glutinate better; three ounces thereof with Juyce of Plantane, and Sugar of Roſes, of each one ounce, make an excellent Medicine. Or boyl Comphry Roots in Steeled Milk.</p>
                     <p>Or make Bread of the fineſt Barley with Yolks of Eggs, and ſet it into the Oven after the Bread is drawn: Crum Milk and Sugar there with til it is as thick as a Pultis; of which let him take five or ſix ſpoonfuls twice or thrice in a day.</p>
                     <p>Veal broth boyled very long doth aſſwage pain in the Ulcers.</p>
                     <p>And Cream of Rice doth heal them up.</p>

                     <p>Cream of Barley with Sugar doth cleſe and cool.</p>
                     <p>Broth made of Burnet with Butter, given three daies together morning and evening, doth much further the Cure, and the more if the Decoction of Burnet at the ſame time be given for ordinary Drink.</p>
                     <p>The Rinds of two greeniſh Oranges boyled in eight pints of Water for ordinary Drink, doth half the Cure.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Crato</hi> wiſely admoniſheth, That before the ſeventh day, before the Ulcers of the Guts are wel clenſed, you give no aſtringents at the mouth, nor externally, but after the ſeventh day you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with gentle aſtringents.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Montanus</hi> doth wholly forbid them, and uſeth only Clenſers Aſſwagers of pain and thickners: But when the matter of the Diſeaſe is wel evacuated, the weakneſs of the retentive Faculty by which the Flux is nouriſhed, may be wel taken away with aſtringents.</p>
                     <p>Therefore it wil be profitable, after ſufficient Purging to give for many days Bole, Terra Lemnia, pouder of Elder-berries, or other aſtringents and dryers with Sugar, till the patient be wel: but if too much binding ſeem to hurt, you muſt purge again, then bind and after purge; and you muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that thoſe Earths do avail too wayes, namely by Binding, and by Oppoſing the evil quality which is in the Diſeaſe: And the Obſtruction which is feared by their uſe is taken away by Sugar mixed with them.</p>
                     <p>To allay Pain, and healthe the Ulcer, this Electuary is beſt.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the mucilage of Quince-ſeeds, Comfry Roots, and Gum Tragacanth, all extracted with Roſe Water, of each one ounce: Starch one dram; Red Coral two drams: Bole Armonick prepared one dram; Pomegranate Flowers half a dram: Rob, or conſerve of Services, or Quinces two ounces: Sugar of Roſes one ounce: make it like an Electuary: the Doſe is two dram.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Narcoticks, or things that bring reſt given at the mouth do wonders, for they take away pain, ſtop the Flux, provoke ſleep, and refreſh the ſtrength: but they are better when they are mixed with Aſtringents and Strengthners. As,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>old conſerve of Roſes two drams: Laudarum three grains: Confectio Alkermes, half a ſcruple: make a Bolus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In a Malignant, and Epidemical, or Common Dyſentery, Medicines of Bezoar and Sudorifick, or Sweating Medicines, are powerful; for it is obſerved that by theſe Remedies, that the matter hath been diſcharged, and the Dyſentery cured: Therefore obſerve at firſt the nature of the Humor; for if it be Malignant, as in a Common Epidemical Diſeaſe it is, you ſhal in vain try other Medicines, except at the ſame time, and in the beginning you give Antidotes or Cordials. Here you may uſe al things proper to a Malignant Feaver: And beſides thoſe things that provoke Sweat, as Bezoar and Aqua Theriacalis, or Treacle water; Harts-horn, ſealed Earth, Bole Armonick, Unicorns-horn, Coral, Amber, Scordium, St. Johns-wort, Plantane, Tormentil, Burnet, and many others are very good.</p>
                     <p>Outwardly to the whol Belly apply Oyl of Quinces and Roſes; or if you wil have it more aſtringent Oyl of unripe Olives, or put the third part of Vinegar to them, and boyl them to the Conſumption of the Vinegar: If the Stomach be Affected alſo, adde Oyl of Maſtich, and Wormwood.</p>

Or when there is no Feaver uſe a weak Decoction of Maſtich with the Syrups aforeſaid. According to <hi>Crato</hi>'s Judgment, you muſt not uſe any chaly beat or ſteeled Drink; for it doth not aſtringe, as commonly they ſuppoſe, but trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth the belly.

                        <hi>Chap. 7.</hi> Of Teneſmus.</head>
                     <p>TEneſmus, is a continual deſire to go to ſtool, and voiding of nothing but Slime or bloody Matter.</p>
                     <p>The immediate Cauſe of this Diſeaſe, is an Ulcer in the ſtreight Gut called <hi>Inteſtinum rectum;</hi> from which, Quittor or filthy Matter continually floweth, and ſtirreth up the expulſive Faculty, by which means there is a continual deſire of going to ſtool. Moreover, there is voided a ſlimy Matter mixed with blood, from the depravation of the <hi>Homoioſis</hi> (or quality that converts things into its likeneſs) of the ulcerated part, becauſe it cannot wel concoct its proper Nouriſhment, and make it like it ſelf, but turns it into another ſlimy ſubſtance; as we ſhewed more at large in Dyſenteries, and other Ulcers of the Guts.</p>
                     <p>But in regard we ſaid in the Chapter of Dyſentery, That al the Inteſtines might be ulcerated in that diſeaſe; thence it ſeems to follow, That the Ulcers of the ſtraight Gut called <hi>Rectum</hi> belong to a Dyſentery. Yet Cuſtom hath ſo prevailed, that when the Rectum is only hurt, it is called by the name of <hi>Teneſmus:</hi> And becauſe when other Guts are affected, if the Rectum ſuffer, there is alſo Teneſmus or needing, although the diſeaſe be then called a Dyſentery; therefore Dyſentery and Teneſmus are of the ſame Nature, and have the ſame Cauſe, and differ only in reſpect of the part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected: And therefore we need not repeat the Cauſes, becauſe they are the ſame with thoſe that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a Dyſentery.</p>
                     <p>For the Knowledg of this Diſeaſe, there is no more required but to diſtinguiſh it from a Dyſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, which you may learn from the definition. For in a Teneſmus, there is a continual needing; but in a Dyſentery it is by fits: beſides, in that, after great ſtraining, there is voided only a little ſlime, bloody or mattery; but in a Dyſentery, both Excrements and Humors are continually voided.</p>
                     <p>The Signs of the Cauſes are the ſame with a Dyſentery.</p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſtick, <hi>Celſus</hi> Lib. 4. Cap. 19. ſaith that a Teneſmus is eaſily cured, and that of it ſelf it never kils any, yet <hi>Galen, 5. de uſu partium, cap.</hi> 4. reckons it among the chiefeſt Diſeaſes of the Belly; and truly it may very wel be accounted grievous in reſpect of its troubleſomneſs and long continuance; yet it is not dangerous except it come of Melancholly, for then it tends to a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer ulcerated: beſides, it brings great inconveniences, as Miſcarriage or Abortion to Women. So <hi>Hipp.</hi> Aph. 27. Sect. 7. ſaith, If a Woman with Child have a Teneſmus, ſhe wil miſcarry. For the continual ſtraining at ſtool doth much diſturb the Womb, which is ſo neer to the ſtraight Gut. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the ſame Muſcles which ſerve to throw out the Excrements, are imployed for delivery; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when they daily compreſs the lower Belly, they cauſe Abortion. Laſtly, the Ulcers of the <hi>Rectum Inteſtinum</hi> being neer the <hi>Anus</hi> or Fundament, if they contitue long, turn to an incurable Fiſtula.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="304" facs="tcp:49088:144"/>The Cure of a Teneſmus, little differs from the Cure of a Dyſentery. And therefore firſt, the ſharp Humors that come from the Liver and other parts, are to be purged with Medicines that leave an Aſtringent quality, as chiefly Rhubarb, which muſt be ſo often given till the Humor ſeem to be ſpent.</p>
                     <p>If there be an Inflamation (which is chiefly known by a Feaver) or if much blood, you muſt open a Vein. And in caſe it continue after bleeding, and cauſe a ſtrangury or difficulty of Urine (as it often doth) it is very good to open the Hemorrhoids with Horſ-leeches.</p>
                     <p>Alſo you muſt uſe aſſwaging Clyſters when there is much pain; and clenſing, glutinating, and aſtringent, according as the Ulcer requireth; the Forms whereof are to be found in the Cure of Dyſentery.</p>
                     <p>But in the uſe of Clyſters, obſerve firſt, that you give them often, and in a ſmal quantity, only half a pint, becauſe they wil be hardly kept any time, by reaſon of the continual needing. And the pipe muſt be warily conveyed in, leſt the pain be encreaſed.</p>
                     <p>And you muſt diligently apply Fomentations, Inſeſſions or Baths to ſit in, Fumigations, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitories, and Oyntments.</p>
                     <p>You may make a Fomentation thus,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Mullein &amp; Wormwood, of each ſix handfuls: boyl them in new Milk and put them into two Bags, which apply to the Anus and whol belly one after another very warm.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Chamomel Flowers, and Roſes, of each one handful: Red Wine two Pints: infuſe them two hours upon hot Embers: Foment the Fundament as hot as can be ſuffered with four times doubled cloathes: After let the Patient ſit upon a ſpunge dipped and ſtra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>Or, Fill two Bags with Barley Bran and boyl them in Vinegar: Let the Patient ſit one while up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one, another while upon another as hot as he can.</p>
                     <p>If he void much Blood, make the Fomentation thus,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Mullein Leaves and Roots two handfuls: Red Roſes one pugil: Pomegranate peels, and Galls, of each half an ounce: boyl them in two parts of Iron-Water, and one of Red Wine for a Fomentation: which you may make ſtronger if you ad half an ounce of Allum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Inſeſſus, or Baths to ſit in to aſſwage Pain, are made of Emollients boyled in Water, or Broth of Sheeps Heads and Feet, to which you may ad Violets, Nightſhade, Gourds, and Mellons ſliced, but for healing of Ulcers you muſt make them of Aſtringents afore-mentioned.</p>
                     <p>Fumigations are good to dry the Ulcer made of Frankinſence burnt, or the Decoction of Savin made in Oxycrate, or other things mentioned in the Cure of a Dyſentery, the Fume whereof muſt be taken ſitting in a hollow Chair. But this following is Commended by <hi>Foreſtus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Maſtich one dram: Frankinſence one ſcruple: Myrtles one dram and an half: Red Roſes two ſcruples: make a Pouder for a Fumigation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Suppoſitories are good in this Diſeaſe, they muſt be gentle and mild, leaſt they exaſperate the part which is ſo ſenſible: They are fitly made of Goats Suet cut into the form of a Suppoſitory; for they appeaſe the pain &amp; heal the Ulcer: but they wil be better againſt Pain if you mix the ſeed finely poudered of Poppies or Henbane, &amp; tye them in a knot in Paper like a Suppoſitory: But far beſt if you inſtead of theſe things put three drops of the Oyl preſſed out of theſe Seeds to every Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory: or one grain of Opium diſſolved in half a ſcruple of Oyl of ſweet Almonds.</p>
                     <p>The Ulcer wil be ſooner healed, if you firſt diſſolve the Suet, either alone, or with white Starch, Gum Tragacanth beaten, and firſt ſteeped in Plantane Water, or elſe with ſome Narcoticks: Or, thus,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Gum Tragacanth as much as is ſufficient, ſprinkle it with Plantane Water that it may only ſwel and not diſſolve; then ad as much of the mucilage of Fleabane ſeeds, or Quince ſeeds, and mix them with the white of an Egg roaſted; then with melted Wax make them into a Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory: You may alſo ad Narcoticks: as likewiſe to Cure the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>cer better, the Pouders of Ceruſs, Tutty, Bole, Pomegranate Flowers, and the like which dry without Acrimony, and ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; And theſe muſt be very finely Poudered and ſifted, leaſt the Part be Exasperated.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You may apply Oyls and Oyntments as in a Dyſentery, to the Belly and Fundament: As Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Roſes, Populeon, or of the Mucilages, of the whites of Eggs, Oyl of Roſes, and the like, to take away Pain and Inflamation: and other things that ſhal be mentioned in the Chapter of Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhoids, or to Cure the Ulcer, the white Oyntment of Rhaſis or Pompholygos, melted in Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel, or in Honey and Water.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, In a more deſperate Condition, uſe Narcoticks both inwardly and outwardly; but three or four grains of Laudanum is beſt given with Maſtich and Terra Sigillata, or mixed in a Clyſter made or a Decoction of the Flowers of Chamomel.</p>

                     <p>A Flux of the Liver, is that in which ſerous and bloody Humors like water wherein fleſh hath been waſhed, are voided</p>
                     <p>This Diſeaſe is produced from the Liver being weak and out of tune; by reaſon whereof it cannot breed good blood, but turneth the Chylous Matter into thin and ferous blood, which becauſe it is not fit to nouriſh, is ſent by Nature into the Inteſtines, from whence comes this flux of the Liver.</p>
                     <p>This weakneſs and diſorder may come from any diſtemper: For by the exceſs of any of the firſt qualities, the native heat, and its power to make blood, is dejected. Yet this hath a doubt riſing from Experience, becauſe we ſee often, that great diſtempers of the Liver, and exceſs in the firſt qualities, do produce other diſeaſes, and not this. And again, this flux is many times without the exceſs of the firſt qualities. That therefore the Nature of this Diſeaſe may be declared, we muſt ſay with wiſe <hi>Varandaeus</hi> my Maſter, There is ſomthing more than an ordinary diſtemper for produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of this diſeaſe. And it is occult or hidden, conſuming the radical moiſture in the Liver, which alſo deſtroyeth the Natural heat.</p>
                     <p>This evil diſpoſition, and occult diſtemper may come by burning and ſwooning Feavers by a hot diſtemper of the Bowels, which melteth the Oyly ſubſtance by occult corruption, and corruption of Humors, by a great coldneſs from flegm and Melancholly abounding, which doth oppreſs and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the Natural heat; and it may come by outward Cauſes, as great draughts of cold Water, Snow, or Ice, extraordinary eating of raw Sallets, Poyſon, and Medicines that purge too vehemently. By drinking of too much new Wine, ſalt, ſharp, and peppered Meats, and ſtrong things which parch the ſubſtance of the Liver. To theſe you may add al other Cauſes which by too much cooling or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting do diſſolve the ſtrength and tone or order of the Liver.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto is declared a true and proper flux of the Liver which hath this ſign, there are Liquid and ferous ſtools, like waſhings of fleſh, from the weakneſs of the Liver, which cannot ſanguifie or make blood well, or from a malignant diſtemper which ſpoileth the Natural heat and moiſture.</p>
                     <p>There is alſo a baſtard flux of the Liver, which comes of a ſimple diſtemper without any fault of the radical moiſture; by which diſtemper the faculty is not hurt, but the work hindered, ſo that inſtead of pure blood, there comes impure and corrupt, or the good turns into evil, when in a true of the Liver there is never any good blood in the Liver.</p>
                     <p>The Blood is corrupted, either by the mixture of Choller, or Melancholly, or ſome other impure Matter, or from its too long ſtaying in the Liver, and the parts adjacent, by which it is made thicker or burnt, or rotteth; or from the fault of the Spleen, which doth not ſuck away the droſſie blood; and in this baſtard flux, ſomtimes thick, ſomtimes black, and ſomtimes blood is voided mixed with Humors of divers colors.</p>
                     <p>The ſigns of this Diſeaſe may be gathered from what hath been ſaid. For in a true flux there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear moiſt ſtools like waſhings of fleſh, which is not in other bloody fluxes, if in a Dyſentery at any time, it is ſeldom, and then there is choller, flegm, and excrements of divers colors voided: and in a Dyſentery there is pain and torment of the belly, but in this none.</p>
                     <p>The Signs of the Cauſes are known by their proper Characters: For if the weakneſs of the Liver come from a hot diſtemper, there went a burning and conſuming Feaver before, or there is green vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits or ſtools, thirſt, and a Feaver, foulneſs of Body, and want of appetite, and ſtinking Evacuations; but if it come from a cold cauſe, the ſtools are leſs ſtinking, neither is there thirſt or conſumption; the whol Body is colder and blewiſh.</p>
                     <p>Somtimes there comes a Feaver from the putrefaction of Humors, which changeth the ſaid ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes; but you muſt examine the Cauſes afore going, which will declare both diſtempers. Alſo in this cold diſtemper the Patients deſire much ſtrong Wine.</p>
                     <p>A moiſt and dry diſtemper are known by the contrary effects. A moiſt cauſeth more and oftener ſtools, very thin; but a dry, little and thicker ſtools, but there is alſo great thirſt.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, The external Cauſes are known by the relation of the Patient, and thoſe that are with him.</p>
                     <p>A baſtard flux of the Liver hath almoſt all ſigns of a Dyſentery, only there is no pain of the belly, nor pieces of fleſh in the ſtools as in a Dyſentery.</p>
                     <p>The Prognoſtick of this Diſeaſe uſeth to be evil and deadly; for when a principal part is very ill, by conſumption of the radical moiſture, whoſe reparation is ſcarce to be hoped for, we can expect for the moſt part nothing but deſtruction, eſpecially when the Diſeaſe comes of heat.</p>

                        <pb n="306" facs="tcp:49088:145"/>When this diſeaſe comes in Feavers, there preſently follows a melting of the Body, and great pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction, which preſently kils the party: For in malignant and peſtilent Feavers the danger is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed according to the evil condition of the Cauſe. But when this Diſeaſe comes of a cold diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, it uſeth to laſt longer, and turn into an incurable Dropſie.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, A baſtard flux of the Liver, although it be dangerous, yet is it leſs than a true, becauſe it comes only from a ſimple diſtemper and evil diſpoſition of the Humors, the tone and ſtrength of the Liver remaining ſound, and may be cured by taking away the Cauſes that defile the Blood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p>The Cure of this Diſeaſe is wrought by Medicines that ſtrengthen the Liver, correct its diſtemper, and ſtay the flux. And becauſe it comes ofteneſt of a hot diſtemper, therefore we wil firſt ſpeak of the Cure of that diſtemper, becauſe it comes ſeldom of a cold Cauſe, and is to be cured as a Dropſie.</p>

                     <p>Clyſters are here of little worth, becauſe the Liver is affected; yet ſomtimes you may give one of chaly beat or ſteeled Milk, or of a gentle aſtringent Decoction, leſt the Guts ſhould be too much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxed.</p>

                     <p>ALthough Worms breed in divers parts of the Body, yet becauſe they are more uſual in the Gut than in other parts, therefore we wil ſpeak only of thoſe.</p>
                     <p>By ſome it is queſtioned, to what kind of Diſeaſe that is preternatural the Worms are to be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? But we can take away al occaſion of doubting, by ſaying that after a divers conſideration they may refer to all kinds of Diſeaſes; for as they prick and pull the Guts, or obſtruct them, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce other diſeaſes, they may be ſaid to be cauſes of diſeaſes. But as they are ſubſtances added to thoſe which ought naturally to be contained in the Guts, they are reckoned by <hi>Galen</hi> in the number of thoſe Diſeaſes which are in the number encreaſed wholly againſt Nature, as the ſtone alſo. And laſtly, as they are ſent out preternaturally by the belly, or the mouth, they are to be referred to the fault in Excretion, or ſending forth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Galen</hi> in his Comment upon the Aphoriſms, Aph. 26. Sect. 3. propounds three kinds of Worms: The round Worms, which are often bred in the Guts, and get often up into the Stomach; the Aſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides, or little Worms like ſmal thrids, which uſe to lie in the inferior part of the thick Inteſtines, and over againſt the Sphincter Muſcle; and the broad Worms, called <hi>Faſcia,</hi> becauſe they are long and broad like Childrens Swathing bands. This kind is more rare to be ſeen than the reſt, and a Phyſitian ſhall ſcarce ſee them in his practice twice or thrice in a yeer, yet there are great Controverſies among Authors about them; ſome ſay it is one Worm only; ſome that it is made of many united, which they call <hi>Cucurbitinos,</hi> or Gourd Worms, and ſay that they are parts of the broad Worm; others make a fourth kind, containing the Gourd Worms; but we do not intend here to ſhew their Reaſons and ſeveral Experiences they have ſo much boaſted of: the curious Reader may ſearch for his better ſatisfaction, <hi>Rondoletius, Platerus, Sennertus,</hi> and many others.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, There is a great Controverſie of the Cauſes of Worms: ſome ſay they come of putrid heat, others from the Natural, others ſay that both concur for the production of them.</p>
                     <p>The firſt ſay, That all Infects or Vermine come from corruption, according to <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> The ſecond ſay, That putriu heat is ſtrong, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ort, to reconcile the former, ſay that the Matter is diſpoſed by the putrid heat to generate Worms and the Natural heat doth turn it ſo prepared into worms by way of Concoction.</p>
                     <p>But this Reconciliation wil not hold, becauſe according to the axiome in Phyſicks it is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the ſame thing to diſpoſe the matter and bring in the form, and therefore the preparation of
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:49088:146"/>
the matter, and the introduction of the form, ought to be from the ſame agent; beſides, Worms breed in Carkaſſes where there is no native heat, we may ſay that the heat which is putrid, in reſpect of the matter putrifying, is native in reſpect of the Worms, becauſe the natural and putredinal heat differ but in degree, but divers degrees of heat are required for the generation of divers Creatures; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heat which is putrid in reſpect of us may be natural in reſpect of another Creature: So the heat which is natural to a Lyon, would cauſe Feavers in us; and by conſequence is putrefactive: Many flie to the heat of the Sun which is the univerſal Cauſe of al generation; but we muſt alwayes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a particular Cauſe from whence the effect is immediately produced, by the Concurrence and Co-operation of the univerſal Cauſe: but here is a greater difficulty, becauſe it is a common axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ome or theoreme, That nothing can beget a thing more Noble than it ſelf; and therefore heat is not the chief agent in breeding of Worms which are in the praedicament of ſubſtance, and heat is but an accident; and whatſoever is ſpoken of the Sun, the form of a Worm is more Noble than the form of the Sun, becauſe it is the form of a living Creature; and that of the Sun is <hi>Forma mixta,</hi> or the form of a mixed body only: This Doubt brings us into that large and weighty Diſputation of an Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal Generation, in the Circuit whereof very excellent Philoſophers have Writ whol Volumns, to which we ſend our Reade<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This Opinion doth not much differ from the old Philoſophy, which teacheth, That Forms proceed from the power in the Matter: but they think it ſafer to hide the Seeds of things in their Matter, which are truly efficient, than to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge only the power of the Matter, which hath no power to be an efficient, for we muſt find out ſome efficient with the power in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The material Cauſe of Worms is commonly ſweet Flegm which groweth putrid, by which it gets a Diſpoſition to be turned into Worms; but we think it no wayes neceſſary, that food which wil breed Worms, ſhould be firſt turned into Flegm: For Worms may breed of their immediately being putrified, as we ſee in Fleſh, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But let yong Phyſitians obſerve this, It is daily obſerved in Practice, That Sucking Children, that eat meat are moſt troubled with Worms, and becauſe their Stomachs are not able to digeſt it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is corruption and turned into Worms; moreover, Milk is quickly digeſted in the Stomach, and preſently ſent to the Guts; and if it hath meat mixed with it which could not ſo ſuddenly be dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, it wil be ſent into the inteſtines with the Milk, and therefore corrupt and breed Worms. And obſerve, That Worms never breed of Milk only, ſo that as often as you conſider the Diſeaſe of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, take notice, Whether it have the Worms or no, which Women alwayes proclaim and ſay al their Diſeaſes came from thence, as they aſcribe al the Diſeaſes of Women to the Mother; and the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian may certainly pronounce that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> his <hi>com. aph. 26. ſect.</hi> 3. taught this, ſaying, That in Children that Suck milk only no Worms do breed; the Reaſon whereof is not plain. Many ſay, That in ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Children the Heat is not ſtrong enough to breed Worms. And this is confirmed by <hi>Galen</hi> in the place cited; where he ſaith, That ſtrong Heat is required for the Generation of Worms; and thence he ſaith it comes that Worms are more in Youth, than Infancy; which alſo <hi>Hippocrates</hi> teacheth in the Aphoriſm aforeſaid; and which he ſeems to gain-ſay in <hi>lib. 4. de morbis,</hi> where he ſaith, That Worms breed in Children before they are born; but theſe have not ſtronger heat than they that ſuck: And <hi>Hippocrates</hi> gives another Reaſon why Children in the Womb ſhould have Worms, becauſe their Excrements are reteined; but when they are born they do not breed Worms, becauſe then their Excrements are not reteined. But this wil not ſatisfie, becauſe oftentimes in Children that Suck the Excrements are reteined, and yet they have no Worms while they live only upon milk; therefore ſince the aforeſaid Reaſons do not content ſolid wits, we expect the new Thoughts of Wiſe men touching this matter; and in the mean while, we wil briefly declare our Opinion, and leave to the Judgment of the Learned: We ſay then, That Milk putrifying doth grow ſowr, and then is unfit for to breed VVorms, but rather hindereth them; for it is known that al ſowr things do kill VVorms: Hence it is that the Juyce of Lemons is ſo ordinarily given againſt them, and in ordinary drink a little Spirit of Vitriol to ſharpen it doth wonders.</p>
                     <p>It is Commonly thought, That among the Material Cauſes of Worms, Sweet things are the chief; wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ch is to be doubted or, becauſe it is confirmed by a Common Axiome, That Sweet things do eaſily
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:49088:146"/>
turn into Choller and Choller by its bitterneſs doth kil Worms: but we can eaſily anſwer this doubt thus; In Chollerick Bodies, and ſuch as are ſharp with heat, ſweet things do eaſily breed Choller, becauſe by over Concoction, they grow bitter, as we ſee dayly in artificial Concoction: but in other Conſtitutions that are not Chollerick, ſweet things do not breed Choller, but rather flegm, when they are ſent too ſoon from the Stomach into the Guts, and ſo being crude, and only half concocted, they putrifie, and become a fit Matter to breed Worms.</p>
                     <p>But there is yet a difficulty concerning Sugar and Honey, which ſince they have a ſubſtance not ſubject to Putrefaction, but rather that doth preſerve other things from it, cannot breed Worms. This Reaſon convincing, we ſay that Sugar and Honey will not breed Worms, becauſe their ſubſtance is incorruptible; but being once bred, they do feed and maintain them, becauſe the Worms loving ſweet things, do ſtir themſelves at the approach of Honey and Sugar, and get into the Stomach, where they grow with ſpeed; from whence thoſe Symptomes do ariſe which are proper to Worms.</p>
                     <p>The ſigns of Worms in the Guts are divers; not all in all people alike. The uſual and moſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſigns, A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

Other ſigns are leſs uſual, as a continual Feaver, which is often in a day, more violent from the motion of the Worms, with heavineſs, cold ſweat ſomtimes, and fainting, loathing, vomiting, and unquenchable thirſt. The Pulſe is unequal, the Cheeks are by turns red or blew, the Eyes ſhine, the Noſe it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>heth, the Teeth gnaſh, and ſomtimes chatter, there is a ſmal dry Cough, much Spittle: ſomtimes there is heavineſs of head, and ſleepineſs; ſomtimes doting, and Epileptick Convulſions. There is often a pain in the Belly, by gnawing, ſomtimes by inflamation and diſtenſion or ſtretching forth like men in dropſies: ſomtimes there is ſtarting in the ſleep, and ſome tremble, and riſe up, and fall aſleep again; ſomtimes all the body pineth, and the Patient hath a Dogs Appetite, inſatiable, which is moſt uſual in the flat worms, which eat up all the Food. Moreover, If Gourd Worms, called <hi>Cucurbitini,</hi> be voided, they are a ſign of flat. The Aſcarides are known by the itching of the Anus, or Fundament, and the Excrements are many times filled with them.</p>
                     <p>For a Concluſion, The conſuming, putrefaction, and eating away of the Gums, is to be reckoned among the ſigns of the Worms, which is confirmed by this following Obſervation: A certain Boy was a long time troubled with eating away of his Gums, many Medicines both internally and externally were applied, and all in vain; at length he died:- The body being opened, there were found ſo many Worms, that in ſome places the bowels were eaten through, and many were found in the empty pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his Belly.</p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſtick: Many Worms are worſe than few, great than little. Many times they are dangerous, and bring great Diſeaſes; as a ſtrong Feaver by fits, ſwooning, ſpeechleſsneſs, doting, epilepſie, chollick, and dogs appetite.</p>
                     <p>In the beginning of a diſeaſe, it is evil for VVorms to come forth, either alive or dead, eſpecially if they come forth alone, and without dung; for when they are alive, and come forth, they ſignifie great crudity, or want of nouriſhment; but dead, they ſignifie great putrefaction, by which they are killed.</p>
                     <p>VVorms in the declining of a Diſeaſe, coming forth with the Excrements, ſignifie Health, if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction appear; for it appears then, that Nature ruleth and maſtereth the Excrements.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of the Worms is by driving them out, becauſe they are wholly againſt Nature. And this is done by purging Medicines, which kill VVorms, and evacuate the Matter that breedeth them.</p>
                     <p>Rhubarb is the beſt, which you may give in a Flux or Feaver. But you muſt firſt give things that kill them, or at leaſt that drive them to the inferior Inteſtines by things taken at the Mouth, or thoſe things that draw them down by Clyſters.</p>
                     <p>The uſual forms whereof, are theſe:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Dogs-tooth, and Purſlane Water, of each one ounce and an half: Syrup of Lemmons one ounce: Confectio de Hyacintho one dram: the Pouder againſt Worms, one ſcruple. Make a Potion; give it preſently, and then this Clyſter:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>whol Barley, Bran, and red Roſes, of each one pugil: Liquoris and Raiſons, ſcraped and ſtoned, of each half an ounce: Boyl them to half a pint, or three quarters of a pint: Diſſolve in it ſtrained, red Sugar one ounce, and one Yolk of an Egg. Make a Clyſter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You may ad Caſſia, or Diacatholicon, if you deſire it ſtronger.</p>
                     <p>After thoſe Medicines have been given once or twice, give this Potion:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Rhubarb one dram: yellow Sanders half a ſcruple: infuſe them in Water of Dogs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooth or Purſlain, two or three ounces: ſtrain them, and diſſolve in it, the pouder of Rhubarb, and pouder againſt the Worms, of each one ſcruple: Syrup of Roſes one ounce: Mix them for a Potion.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the pouder of Rhubarb and Coralline, of each half a dram, more or leſs, according to the age: Dogs-tooth Water two ounces: Syrup of Violets one ounce. Make a Potion.</hi>

                     <p>Take of <hi>the Oyntment de Artanita, or (Soubread) three ounces: Quick-ſilver one dram: mix them, and anoint the whol belly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then purge again, and often, till the body be clenſed.</p>
                     <p>And you may ad to the former Decoction, Senna, Agarick, Rhubarb, &amp;c. and give it but once in a day.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rondoletius</hi> highly commends the Electuary Diacarthamum, as an excellent Remedy to expel Worms, and to purge Flegm and corrupted Chyle, of which worms breed and are nouriſhed; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he commends the infuſion of Agarick in Oxymel. Which Remedies are proper, if there be no Feaver.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe often times the diſeaſes of the worms in ſome Children cannot be cured without much labor and time, there are many Remedies found out by Authors, both internal and external.</p>
                     <p>Among the Internal, firſt we will treat of Pouders, whereof there are divers Forms in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.</p>
                     <p>The chief are theſe following; the doſe whereof, is from one ſcruple to a dram, according to the age of the Patient in ſome convenient Liquor.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Worm-ſeed half an ounce, Coralline three drams: Harts-horn two drams. Make a Pouder.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Worm-ſeeds, Coralline, and Harts-horn burnt, of each equal parts.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Hiera ſimplex two drams: Worm-ſeed, Scordium, the leſſer Centaury, and Coralline, of each one dram. Make a Pouder.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Rhubarb and Agarick, of each one dram: Troches of Alhandal one ſcruple: Diagri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium half a ſcruple: Coralline and burnt Harts-horn, of each half an ounce: Myrrh, Zedoary, and Tanſie flowers, of each one ſcruple: Salt of Wormwood and Tartar, of each half a dram. Make a fine Pouder.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the uſe of theſe Pouders, obſerve that they which are made of hot things, are to be given ſeldom, and in ſmal quantities to hot Natures, and in Feavers.</p>
                     <p>VVomen uſe to give to Children troubled with the worms, VVorm-ſeed made up with Sugar, or mixed with Honey; which is an excellent Medicine, becauſe the worms deſiring ſweet things, take in the Honey, and withal the VVorm-ſeed, whereby they are deſtroyed.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe VVorm-ſeed is very hot, it may be made temperate by infuſing it two hours in Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and after mixing it with boyled Honey into the form of an Opiate, which <hi>Amatus Luſitanus</hi> doth praiſe as a principal Medicine againſt VVorms.</p>
                     <p>Burnt Harts-horn is commended by <hi>Foreſtus,</hi> given with Raiſons, or otherwiſe, and ſome have been cured with that alone. But it is chiefly good for them who have the worms, and a flux withal. In which diſeaſes coming together, he commends alſo the Juyce of Plantane, and the Decoction of Knot-graſs given to drink. To which may be added Topicks applied to the Belly, partly aſtringent, and partly having vertue to kill worms.</p>
                     <p>Women do uſe common Oyl given with Wine, for that Oyl ſtops the pores of the Worms, and ſo choak them for want of breath, and VVine kills them by its ſharpneſs. But when there is a Feaver, it is better to give Oyl with the Juyce of Lemmons or Pomegranates; or which is better, Oyl of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Almonds with the ſaid Juyces, or Orange flower water.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Stocherus</hi> in his Empirical Medicines, commends the Oyl that is taken out of a d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But we have found by Experience that the Oyl of Juniper given but a drop at a time in Broth, to be excellent for children ſo troubled, if they have not a Feaver.</p>
                     <p>But Quick-ſilver would exceed all, if we durſt give it in wardly; which great Doctors ſay may be done. Some of whom I wil mention, ſo that they who pleaſe to try it, may have Authority for it.</p>

Therefore let us not wonder why</hi> Braſſavolus <hi>that famous Phyſitian of our Age, hath written that he gave Quick-ſilver to Children without any inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And alſo a padua Phyſitian uſed it with good ſucceſs, but never would tell us the way of giving and preparing of it. And I, though I never gave it, have ſeen Midwives give a ſcruple, or half a dram to Women that had hard labor, without inconvenience, and alwaies with good ſucceſs.</hi> Thus <hi>Mathiolus.</hi>

                        <hi>John Baptiſta Zappata,</hi> in his Book of Womens Secrets, Chap. 5. tells many famous Stories of the Cure of Worms by Quick-ſilver, when Aloes and VVormwood would not do it. He ſhews two waies of giving it.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is this:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Quick-ſilver one dram, but a ſcruple or two for little Children: Benjamin half a ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: four or five drops of Aqua vitae, mix them in a glaſs mortar with a glaſs peſtle; then put to it a little Conſerve of Roſes or Violets for a Bolus, which let the Patient take in the morning by it ſelf, or with a little Bread.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſecond way is this:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>a little courſe Sugar, and three or four drops of Spring Water: mix them in a glaſs mortar till they are like Honey: then put to it as much Quick-ſilver as was aforeſaid: mix them together, with ſix or ſeven drops of Oyl of ſweet Almonds, which will keep the Quick-ſilver from coming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to its body: And with a little Conſerve of Roſes, make a Bolus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Baricellus</hi> in his Book called the Genial Garden, ſaith thus: <hi>Quick-ſilver, which ſome account poyſon, is ſafely given againſt worms, and it is accounted ſo certain a Medicine in Spain, that the Women there give three grains thereof to children which pewk up their milk. I cured a Widdow which vomited nine daies together by reaſon of Worms, and ſcarce eat in three daies, neither could retain any thing ſhe took; to whom I gave two ſcruples of Quick-ſilver, with a little Conſerve of Quinces, and ſhe voided downwards above an hundred Worms, and was cured the ſame day, and went about her buſineſs, to the great admiration of her Parents, being formerly weak and lean. I have given it alſo to others, and with good ſucceſs alwaies; and I keep continually at home, Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver infuſed Water, which Water I give to children for Worms; nor did I ever receive any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit thereby. Mathiolus uſed the ſame,</hi> Horatus Angenius, <hi>and many other famous men, who all do extol the benefit of this Medicine. You may give it to Children in ſubſtance, one ſcruple, and to youths two ſcruples or a dram. It is mortified and corrected with red Sugar, in a glaſs, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, wherein it muſt be ſo long ſtirred that it be inviſible, and leaſt it ſhould return to its former condition, you may add thereto two of the Oyl of ſweet Almonds. Give it with Sugar of Roſes Violets, or Quinces, faſting. Thus Baricellus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sanctorius</hi> in meth. vitand. error. lib. 5. cap. 11. ſaith, <hi>That except we uſe ſtrong Medicines to kill worms, as waſhed aloes, or a ſcruple of Quick-ſilver, with a little Turpentine and Aloes made into a ſmal Pill, we do nothing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They who fear to uſe Quick-ſilver crude, may give it prepared, as <hi>Mercurius dulcis,</hi> not only thrice, but ſix times calcined (for by often preparation the malignity of it is abated) with ſome few grains of Diagridium, to carry it ſooner out of the Body, and expel both the Worms, and the Matter of which they breed.</p>
                     <p>You muſt enlarge or diminiſh the quantity, according to the Age of the Patient. As for example, to a Boy of eight or ten yeers old, it may be thus given:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Mercurius dulcis twelve grains: Diagridium ſix grains: Make Pouder to be given with a roaſted Apple and Sugar, or the like.</hi>

                     <p>For ordinary drink, the Water made of Quick-ſilver, which was formerly mentioned, is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, or that in which Quick-ſilver hath been ſhaken in a glaſs half full, for the ſpace of one hour.</p>

                     <p>Alſo Spring Water made ſharp with ſome few drops of the Spirit of Virriol or Sulphur, is of no leſs force. For ſharp things do properly kill VVorms, and the Water is to be made more or leſs ſharp according to the age of the Party.</p>
                     <p>The Decoction of Dog-tooth with Coriander ſeed prepared, is uſed vulgarly for ordinary drink, mixed with Syrup of Lemons or of pomegranats; Or you may put Sugar and a little Vinegar in the Decoction.</p>

                     <p>But if we conjecture that the VVorms are already in the thick Guts, becauſe then they can ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſcend into thin Guts you may give Clyſters to kil them, made thus:</p>

                        <hi>Chap.10.</hi> Of the Immoderate Flux of the Hoemorrhoids.</head>
                     <p>ALthough the moderate Flux of the Hoemorrhoids be healthful, and preſerveth a man from many and grievous Diſeaſes, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> taught in epidemii, and in his Aphoriſms, as from a Pleuriſie, Peripneumonia, or Inflamation of the Lungs; nephritis, or the Stone in the Kidneys; Madneſs, Melancholly, and innumerable other: Yet the immoderate Flux is moſt dangerous, and brings other pernicious Diſeaſes, as Weakneſs of the whol Body, Coolneſs of the Bowels, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the Liver; an Atrophy or want of nouriſhment, an evil Habit, and Dropſie by the loſs of Natural Heat, by ſpending too much Blood which is the treaſure of Life, and the cheeriſher of the whol Body.</p>
                     <p>And this Immoderate Flux hath the ſame Cauſes which uſe to provoke other ſorts of Bleeding: namely, Blood offending in Quantity or Quality; when it offendeth in Quantity, and is brought in great plenty to the Haemorrhoid Veins, it doth violently dilate them and open their Orifices, by the ſtrength of the Expulſive Faculty: but ſomtimes too much Blood coming thither, doth oppreſs the Retentive Faculty.</p>
                     <p>Hence it comes that ſhe being Defective in her duty, there is a great Flux which muſt be reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by art.</p>
                     <p>But while Blood off ends in Quality, as ſharpneſs, it ſtirs up the Expulſive Faculty, to caſt forth by thoſe Veins not only the unprofitable but profitable Blood, the Blood Cauſing this Flux is made ſharper by a mixture of Choller, or ſharp Water.</p>
                     <p>This immoderate Flux is known by the loſs of Strength, and a Senſe of Weakneſs coming from a long Flux and loſs of Blood: As alſo from an evil yellowiſh colour of the whol Body, as if it were the Jaundice.</p>
                     <p>If the Diſeaſe come from Quantity of Blood, there went before Cauſes of increaſe of Blood, and the Patient bears it wel in the beginning, and is more cheerful; but afterwards the Flux continuing, he grows weak, and dejected.</p>
                     <p>But if it comes from ſharpneſs and thinneſs of the Blood, there went before Cauſes that breed cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let or ſharp Water, the body is of a Chollerick Conſtitution and burnt: the blood floweth violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and it is very red, ſhining, and as it were flaming, when otherwiſe offending only in Quantity it uſeth to be black and Melancholly.</p>
                     <p>The Prognoſtick is gathered eaſily from what hath been ſaid, when we reckon up thoſe grievous Diſeaſes which come from this.</p>
                     <p>For the Cure, The Blood muſt be ſtanched, or moderated at leaſt, which muſt be done by Revul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſives, Derivatives, Thickners, and Aſtringents.</p>
                     <p>And firſt, Phlebotomy is a Revulſive Remedy in every Flux of blood, therefore in the Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhoids thus flowing, draw blood from the Arm; and more plentifully if there be ſigns of fulneſs and much hath not been loſt, otherwiſe take but little, and at divers times.</p>
                     <p>Alſo Frictions and Ligatures of the Superior parts do revel the blood, as alſo Cupping Glaſſes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Shoulders, Breaſts, and Hypochondria, which for the better Revulſion may have Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification in the Shoulders, but they muſt be often applied to the places afore-mentioned.</p>
                     <p>Alſo a Gentle Purge doth derive the Chollerick Humors which make the blood ſo violent in the Guts; and this muſt be made of Purging things that have an Aſtringent Quality, as Rhubarb, My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robalans, and Tamarinds, ſuch as were preſcribed againſt Vomiting of Blood: And <hi>Mercurialis</hi> teacheth, That Tamarinds have an eſpecial power to ſtop this kind of bleeding, whether they be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken boyled or in ſubſtance.</p>
                     <p>Alſo ſharp French Pruens which are ſomwhat like Tamarinds being often eaten afore meat, are good: and their uſe is convenient to keep the body looſe, and if theſe wil not ſuffice you may ad o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things which were propounded for the Cure of a Belly bound, becauſe by uſe of Aſtringents the belly wil be bound, and by ſtraining to diſcharge the Excrements that are hard, the Veins wil be more open and bleed more.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="314" facs="tcp:49088:150"/>Afterwards you muſt uſe thoſe things that thicken the Blood, and aſtringe the looſe Veins, ſuch as were preſcribed for vomiting and ſpitting of blood, in form of a Julep Pouder, Opiate, and the reſt; coming to Narcoticks, as is there ſaid, if great need require.</p>
                     <p>And beſides thoſe Remedies, the Pills of Bdellium are much commended by Authors; which <hi>Rondeletius</hi> rejecteth, becauſe the Apothecaries have not true Bdellium, and uſe Mirrh inſtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which cauſeth bleeding. But <hi>Solenander</hi> oppoſeth him, ſaying by Experience, that he hath found theſe Pills make of ordinary Bdellium, ſo cleerly to produce their effect, that he wil not doubt of the compoſition. Except ſome ſhould think that the Myrrh is made dull by drying things, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringents that are mixed therewith. To this we may add what <hi>Bauderon</hi> in his Diſpenſatory, and other Modern Writers ſay, That we have true Bdellium brought from <hi>India</hi> at this day, which is hard to be diſtinguiſhed from Myrrh.</p>
                     <p>The uſe of theſe Pills, is after this manner:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Pills of Bdellium one dram: the Troches of Amber, and Terra ſigillata, of each one ſcruple<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> With the Mucilage of Quince ſeeds extracted with Roſe Water. Make a maſs of Pills, of which let him take a ſcruple twice a day, before Dinner and Supper.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At the ſame time you muſt uſe Topicks made after divers forms.</p>
                     <p>A Fomentation of Mullein boyled in Smiths VVater, or aſtringent VVine, is beſt; for that Plant is proper for the pain and bleeding of the Hemorrhoids. But you muſt diligently obſerve in the uſe of Fomentations, that they be either cold, or moderately hot.</p>
                     <p>A more compound Decoction may be made thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Snakeweed Roots half a pound: Plantane, Mullein, Bramble and Oak buds, of each two handfuls and an half: Sumach berries, Pomegranate flowers, green Galls, and Pomegranate peels, of each one handful: Myrtles half a dram: red Roſes two pugils: Allum one ounce: boyl theſe in three parts of Forge water, and one of old red Wine, for a Fomentation.</hi>

                     <p>Of the Decoction before mentioned, with a greater quantity of every Simple, you may make a Bath to ſit in, which the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum Comitiſſae</hi> is very good, if you anoint the Back and Hemorrhoids therewith: or you may make for the preſent this following:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Oyl of Roſes, Olives, and Myrtles, of each two ounces: the Juyce of Plantane and Mullein, of each one ounce and an half: red Wine Vinegar one ounce: boyl them till the juyces are conſumed: then add of Bole, Sanguis Draconis, Frankinſence, and droſs of Iron finely poudered, of each one dram: Wax as much as will make an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rondoletius</hi> approves rather of thoſe Oyntments which are made without Oyl, becauſe they are more aſtringent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they are thus made:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Juyce of Plantane, Shepheards-purſe, and Mullein, of each two ounces: the ſimple Syrup of Vinegar three ounces: boyl them gently; then add of Bole, Terra ſigillata, and Snake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weed Roots poudered, of each one dram and an half: Sanguis Draconis one ounce: Ceruſs wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed two ſcruples: mix them into the form of a Liniment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the Hemorrhoids be ulcerated, you may make this following:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Oyl of Roſes two ounces: Frankinſence and Aloes, of each one dram: Sarcocol, Sanguis Draconis, and Bole, of each half a dram: Spodium, and Carabe, of each one ſcruple: white Starch three drams: Juyce of Plantane one ounce. Make an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Fat of an Eel, which comes out when it is roaſted, put to the Oyntments, makes them better by a proper Vertue.</p>
                     <p>Alſo you may with profit apply a Cataplaſm to the ſaid parts, made thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Bole, Aloes, Maſtich, Frankinſence, and Sanguis Draconis, of each half an ounce: the ſtones of Myrobalans, and Galls, of each one dram: mix them with the white of an Egg, and Juyce of Plantane. Make a Cataplaſm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or the Hairs of an Hare burnt, and Spiders webs mixed with the white of an Egg, will make a Cataplaſm, which you muſt apply to the Vein where it is open, if it appears, or put it gently in.</p>
                     <p>Suppoſitories are good for this uſe, becauſe they are put up into the part.</p>
                     <p>The Form of them is,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Colophony, and Frankinſence, of each three drams. Bole half an ounce: Ceruſs and burnt Lead, of each one dram: Acacia half a dram: pouder them finely, and make them into a Suppoſitory with Goats Suet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Make Injections into the part by a Syringe of the Juyce of Plantane, and other things mentioned for a Fomentation. The blood of any Creature newly drawn, and injected whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Lungs of a Sheep being hot and bloody, being ſat upon, have great power to ſtop this Blood.</p>
                     <p>Alſo Fumigations made of the Decoctions of the Fomentations aforeſaid, are good for the ſame end. To which you may ad thoſe things mentioned in a Dyſentery. As alſo this following:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Frankinſence, Aloes, Maſtich, red Roſes, Myrtles, and Wormwood, of each half a dram: Troches of Carabe one dram &amp; Make a graſs Pouder to be caſt upon the hot coals; and let the fume thereof be received in a large funnel by a hollow chair, tying a wooden or ſilver pipe to the narrow hole, and putting it into the Fundament.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A Fumigation made of Mullein is the beſt of all.</p>
                     <p>If you can apply Remedies to the Veins that bleed, it is beſt therefore that they may appear And therefore let the Patient be laid upon a Table, and ſtrain as if he were at ſtool till they appear; uſing an Inſtrument if there be need. And then apply the afore mentioned Cataplaſm of the Hair of an Hare and Spiders Webs, or other very drying Remedies; Bole, Allum, or burnt Vitriol. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to touch the Vein with Oyl of Vitriol, is good; or in extream danger with <hi>Aqua fortis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which things, if they prevail not, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his Book of Diet, in acute Diſeaſes, and of the Hemorrhoids, ſhews the way of tying, cutting, and burning of them; which operation is out of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion now, as being moſt painful and perilous. Although <hi>Maſſaria</hi> ſaith that he once ſaw it, the ſtory whereof will be proſitable to be related; for by that you may learn the way of working, and the event. The Hiſtory is this: Frederick Corſicus <hi>of</hi> Vincentia, <hi>firſt had the pain, then the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate flux of the Hemorrboids: And when he had in vain tried many things, went to</hi> Padua; <hi>where the Phyſitians by a common conſent, concluded that the blood muſt be ſtopped. But when many means inwardly and outwardly, were in vain uſed, in the end finding no Remedy, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to try this Manual Operation: But having no fit Chyrurgion, they ſent for a Neapolitan, who profeſſed this Art, and he cut, tied, and burnt the Hemorrhoids of</hi> Fabricius <hi>thus: Firſt he bound him ſo that he could no waies move; then he ſeparates the Hemorrhoids from the Inteſtine; then with a Needle, he paſſeth throw, and ſeweth them, and tieth all about ſtrongly: then cutting off the part of the Vein which is above the ſewing, he burns it with a hot Iron. It was a painful Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Ligature, Section, and Burning: So that</hi> Frederick <hi>had a Feaver, and great pain. But the Chyrurgion gave him a few Medicines by which he was freed both from feaver and pain in a few daies to the admiration of all men there, and recovered from bleeding. But it is not to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, how he being too confident, and neglecting bleeding and purging, which he ſtood after in need of, keeping no orderly diet; the next yeer he was taken with a peſtilent Feaver, and died. From whence we may obſerve the Precept of</hi> Hippocrates, <hi>Aph. 12. Sect. 6. That one Hemorrhoid muſt be kept open. Except the Patient, as</hi> Aetius <hi>obſerveth, had rather prevent the danger that comes by ſtopping of it by a good diet, exerciſe, bleeding, and purging.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But in an ordinary Cure by Medicines, you muſt conſider the Liver and Spleen, becauſe the Meſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raick Veins are inſerted into them, eſpecially if they be hot or weak. And therefore not unprofitably do we apply Epithems, or cooling and ſtrengthening Oyntments, ſuch as we preſcribed in the flux of the Liver, and ſhal more at large be laid down in the hot diſtemper, and inflamation of thoſe parts. Somtimes the Obſtruction of the Bowels, and Meſeraick Veins do cauſe this Diſeaſe; which are to be taken away for the Cure of the Patient. And we have ſomtimes done it with Pills of Steel, which are preſcribed in the Obſtruction of the Liver.</p>
                     <p>The whol time of Cure, let the Patient drink ordinarily Iron Water, or the Decoction of Yar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>
                     <p>At the ſame time, above all things you muſt rectifie the blood, which is the chief cauſe of this flux. Therefore if it be ſharp and Chollerick, it is often to be corrected with the infuſion of Rhubarb and Tamarinds. If it be hot and thin, with thickening and cooling Medicines: if watery, with dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: if much, with a ſlender Diet. For it is vain to think of ſtopping of the blood, except the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of the evil be firſt taken away. Which <hi>Solenander</hi> obſerved, Conſ. 22. Sect. 4. in this following Hiſtory. <hi>I remember</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that I had one</hi> Ann, <hi>a Dukes Daughter, of a great flux of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhoids; and becauſe ſhe was far ſpent, I took much pains to ſtop the flux. But when I perceived that the firſt day after they were ſtopped, ſhe began to ſwel about the Heart. Being ſent for again, the ſeventh day I opened the Veins again; nor could I ſafely ſtop them before I had given gentle Evacutions, and alte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </p>
                     <p>After you have cured the flux of the Hemorrhoids, you muſt prevent their return: which is done by good Diet, and bleeding twice or thrice in a yeer, and with an ordinary Purge of a Magiſtral Syrup, or other Medicine, with an iſſue made in the Leg, and the like; which are to be altered according to the divers diſpoſitions of Bodies. Moreover, Mineral Waters of Vitriol, Allum, and Iron, are very convenient.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fonſeca</hi> commends the Decoction of the Maſtich Tree, or the Infuſion of it in VVine, for a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, thus made:</p>

                        <hi>Chap. 11.</hi> Of the Pain of the Haemorrhoids.</head>
                     <p>THe <hi>Haemorrhoid</hi> Veins that are in the end of the <hi>Rectum Inteſtinum,</hi> or ſtreight Gut, ſomtimes do ſwel and cauſe very great pain.</p>
                     <p>This ſwelling comes of the ſame Cauſe with the Flux or bleeding of the Haemorrhoids; namely, Of blood offending in Quantity or Quality, which if it findeth not away, and cannot open the ends of the Veins, there it ſettleth, and by filling of the Veins cauſeth a Tumor with Inflamation, and pain. The principal Cauſe why Blood cannot get out of the Veins, is the thickneſs of it, becauſe it is Melancholly: for commonly the Hemorrhoid Veins, eſpecially internal, are ſaid to receive Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly from the Spleen, and ſomtimes to purge it forth.</p>
                     <p>Authors give many differences of Hemorrhoids, from their greatneſs, number, figure, and place: whence ſome are called great, others little; ſome more, ſome leſs; ſome are like Grapes, Mulber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Warts, or Bladders; thence termed Uval, Moral, Verrucal, or Veſical. Some are External, ſome Internal.</p>
                     <p>From theſe things the knowledg of them is eaſie; for from a Tumor in the outſide of the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from its greatneſs, color, and conſiſtence, the differences are known. And they are to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from other Diſeaſes which uſe to be in the Fundament, as <hi>Rhagades,</hi> Clefts; <hi>Condy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomata,</hi> Swellings with Inflamation; <hi>Thymi,</hi> Kernels; <hi>Fici,</hi> Piles, and the reſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rhagades</hi> are certain Ulcers like Clefts in the Hands and Lips, from vehement cold. They have no likeneſs with the Hemorrhoids; but we will explain them with the reſt, although they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to be referred to external Diſeaſes, that you may with the knowledg of the Hemorrhoids know all diſeaſes of the Fundament.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Condylomata</hi> are certain Tumors of the Skin, which being wrinkled, if it ſwel by Humors, it is called <hi>Condyloma.</hi> It is diſtinguiſhed from a Hemorrhoid, becauſe a Hemorrhoid is greater, black, and round in a Vein; but this is long, of the ſame color, and not in the Veins.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thymi</hi> are carnous ſwellings, which are not only in the Fundament, but Privities of Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, like Warts, and like the flowers of Thyme, from whence they have their name. Theſe are lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, white, or reddiſh, without pain; but the Hemorrhoids are greater, black, for the moſt part painful.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fici</hi> are alſo fleſhy Swellings, but greater than <hi>Thymi;</hi> alſo they are blew and painful, and therefore more like Hemorrhoids: but they are diſtinguiſhed from them, becauſe they are all fleſh; but the Hemorrhoids ſhew the Veins full, and enlarged at the ends. Moreover, <hi>Fici</hi> for the moſt part ulcerate, and are malignant, ſo that they are like a Cancer.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe Caruncles, or pieces of fleſh which grow in the Fundament, are like theſe <hi>Fici,</hi> called <hi>Criſtae,</hi> or Tufts, uſual in <hi>Italy,</hi> but unuſual among us, becauſe they come from an impure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Lechery: they look like the Combs of Cocks, and thence they have their name: Becauſe they are nothing like the Hemorrhoids they need no diſtinction. But let this be for a Concluſion, All the aforeſaid Diſeaſes are cured only by Chyrurgery, ſo that a peculiar way is not to be layed down here.</p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſtick, The Swelling Hemorrhoids, they are ſeldom dangerous; but ſomtimes ſo inflamed, that you may fear a Gangrene; or elſe they extreamly torment the Patient.</p>
                     <p>Hemorrhoids, if they come to Suppuration, or an Ulcer, often times leave a Fiſtula, which is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times incurable, by reaſon of the tenderneſs of the part, and the great moiſture which hindereth the healing of it.</p>
                     <p>For the Cure hereof, firſt let blood in the Arm, and make a Revulſion from the part affected. Which being ſufficiently done, you may alſo open the Vein in the Ancle for revulſion.</p>
                     <p>The ſame is done by Cupping of the Hypochondria for Revulſion, and the Hipps for Deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Strong Purges are not good in this caſe, becauſe they draw the Humors to the part, and encreaſe the Tumor. But you muſt conſtantly keep the Body open, becauſe hard Excrements, and voided with ſtraning, encreaſe pain. An Infuſion of Caſſia given morning and evening, is good for this, thus made:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Lettice, Bugloſs tops, Mallows, of each one handful: Liquoris ſcraped, and Raiſons ſioned, of each half an ounce: Bugloſs, Borrage, and Violet flowers, of each one pugil. Boyl them to eight ounces. In the ſtraining infuſe Caſſia new drawn one ounce; ſtrain it, and clarifie
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:49088:152"/>
it; and then put thereto one ounce of Syrup of Violets. Give it twice a day as aforeſaid.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Somtimes to aſſwage the ſharpneſs of the Humor you may give the Emulſions of the cold Seeds, made with the aforeſaid Decoction.</p>
                     <p>In the mean while, divers Topicks are to be uſed to appeaſe pain, take away Inflamation, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs the Humor. Or Oyl of ſweet Almonds newly drawn, and which is better, the Oyl of Peach Kernels, or Gourd Seeds, Poppy, or Henbane Seeds.</p>
                     <p>Oyl of Box-tree is beſt, becauſe it is ſtupifying: And as it cures all Tooth-ach miraculouſly, ſo doth it mitigate all other: and this, if you lay but a drop with a little Lint upon the Hemorrhoids; or if you mix it with Lin-ſeed Oyl, in this proportion, that there be half an ounce of that, and one ſcruple of Oyl of Box.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quercetan</hi> highly commends the Oyl of Nuts in which Sows or Hog-lice have been boyled. You may alſo boyl Hog-lice in common Oyl, and it will much aſſwage pain.</p>
                     <p>Plain Oyl of Eggs, or made in a Leaden Mortar, doth the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Divers Liniments and Oyntments may be preſcribed for the ſame: Some whereof do only appeaſe pain; ſome diſcuſs the Tumor, and dry; others heat the Ulcers. And you may apply them with Lint.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>one Yolk of an Egg; as much Oyl of Roſes, or Violets as will make a Liniment: To which if you put Populeon, it will aſſwage pain better; and when the pain is very violent, you may add a little Opium.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Hens Greaſe half an ounce: the pap of an Apple roaſted in the Embers one ounce: Saffron half a dram: Populeon half an ounce: With the Yolk of one Egg make a Lini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Oyl of Violets two ounces: Populeon half an ounce: With one whol Egg make an Oyntment: or let the white of an Egg be beaten with Breaſt-milk, and applied to the part, with clouts dipped therein.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Mucilage of Fleabane ſeeds two ounces: Oyl of Violets three ounces. Make a Liniment.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Mucilage of Fleabane and Foenugreek ſeeds extracted with Wine, of each two drams: Freſh Butter three ounces: Goats Suet one ounce. Mix them in a Leaden Mortar for a Liniment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or Butter alone, ſet in a Leaden Mortar in the Sun till it wax black, is an excellent Medicine.</p>
                     <p>Alſo freſh Pomatum is very Anodine.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Juyce of Purſlain and Honey, of each four ounces. Mix them in a Leaden Mortar into the form of a Liniment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent of Roſes two ounces: Quick-ſilver two drams. Mix them into a Lini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>white Diachylon mollified with the Oyl of Chamomel two ounces: Saffron one ſcruple: Opium three grains. Make an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Horſtius</hi> much commends an Oyntment made of wild Flax, with its flowers boyled in Hogs greaſe. To which being ſtrained, and a little cooled, you muſt add the Yolk of an Egg, and apply it to the part with Lint. He ſaith that it aſſwageth theſe kind of pains miraculouſly, and that he had from <hi>John Wolf</hi> that famous Phyſitian of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> who refuſed to diſcover it to his Prince, the Landgrave of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> till he promiſed him every yeer a fatted Ox.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Liniments following are good to diſcuſs the Tumor, and aſſwage pain.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Leeks and roaſt them in a wet cloth in the embers, and beat them with freſh Butter, and they will take away pain and ſwelling.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A red Onion doth the ſame boyled with the pap of a Lilly, and beaten with Oyl of Myrtles.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>the Oyl of Peach Kernels, and bitter Almonds, of each two ounces: Liquid Storax and Bdellium, of each two drams. Diſſolve them in</hi> Oleo, <hi>and mix them for a Liniment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Balſom of Sulphur made of the Flower of Brimſtone, and Spirit of Turpentine, is good to aſſwage pain and ſwelling, and to clenſe the Ulcers of thoſe parts. And better, if inſtead of Oyl of Turpentine you uſe the Oyl of St, Johns-wort, and of Eggs. Alſo when there is great ſwelling with Inflamation, you may uſe Oyl of Roſes, or of Violets inſtead of the Oyls aforeſaid.</p>
                     <p>Alſo Cataplaſms are good for the ſame purpoſe. Of which the moſt common for taking away all pains, is that of white Bread and Milk boyled, adding Oyl of Roſes, and Yolks of Eggs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aquapendens</hi> commends a Cataplaſm of Plantane, Pellitory of the wall, and Mallows boyled in Water, and after with Oyl of Roſes; to which, when he would have it more drying, he adds Barley Meal, and Millet Meal: And if the pain be great, he makes it of Milk. He commends alſo the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſm of Leek Heads, boyled in Common Oyl or Oyl of Myrtles, or made of Pilewort boyled in Water.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="318" facs="tcp:49088:153"/>Green Elder Leaves boyled to ſlime in Water, and then ſpread upon a cloth as big as the Palm of your Hand, and applied hot to the Patient lying upon his Belly; if it be often renewed for many hours, and the part firſt anointed with common Oyl, or the Decoction of the ſame, is very excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</p>
                     <p>The Leaves alſo of Elder ſtamped and applied cold, do take away the pain the third dreſſing.</p>
                     <p>Alſo Purſlain ſtamped and applied, aſſwageth pain and ſwelling, heats the Ulcers, and conſumeth proud fleſh.</p>
                     <p>A white Onion roaſted in the Embers, and made with freſh Butter into a Cataplaſm, doth aſſwage pain, and diſcuſs the Tumor.</p>
                     <p>Let Fomentations be applied to the part to take away pain, made of the Decoction of Mullein, Mallows, Holyhocks, Pellitory, Lin-ſeed, Foenugreek ſeed, Marſh-mallows, Chamomel flowers, and Dill boyled in Milk, or in the want of Milk, in Water and Oyl, or Tripe Broth.</p>
                     <p>You may make a Bath with a greater quantity of the ſame Ingredients.</p>
                     <p>Cold Water alone, is a good Fomentation, and a Bath alſo. But in Winter warm it.</p>
                     <p>Alſo foment in Roſe Water in which Salt of Lead hath been diſſolved, eſpecially if the part be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed.</p>
                     <p>To take away ſwelling, it is good to foment with red Wine wherein Allum is boyled.</p>
                     <p>Polypody of the Oak, and St. Johns-wort boyled in equal parts of Wine and Water, doth ſenſibly abate the ſwelling of the Hemorrhoids, if the Decoction be ſqueezed in by degrees with a ſpunge, the Waters of hot Baths applied with Spunges, or to ſit in, are alſo good.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aquapendens</hi> applieth a Spunge dipped in Time Water and ſqueezed, and after bound upon the part; a Fumigation of the aforeſaid Decoction while it is hot, or of Mullein boyled in Milk with Rye Flower, doth alſo appeaſe pain. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Houſleek two handfuls: boyl them in white Wine, and let the Patient receive the Fume through an hollow Chair.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To conſume and dry up the Piles, a Fumigation made of the Pouder of Darnel, Mullein, Pilewort, caſt upon hot coals, is good, and better if you mix Brimſtone therewith. Alſo it is made of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone only, which taken in with a Funnel, drieth up the blind Hemorrhoids. Alſo a Fumigation made of a Fire-ſtone quenched in Vinegar.</p>
                     <p>And this following Injection is marvelous good for the ſame, if often uſed.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Juyce of Plantane, and Oyl of Violets, of each four ounces: Natural Balſom half an ounce. Make an Injection into the Anus.</hi>

                        <hi>Amatus Luſitanus</hi> in the 91. Cure, Cent. 2. doth praiſe this following Suppoſitory, in theſe words: <hi>A Roman Lady which lived at St.</hi> Angelo's <hi>Bridg, having her Womb forth, complained alſo of the pain of the Hemorrhoids: And after we had uſed many choyce Medicines, by which ſhe received no benefit, we gave her a Suppoſitory of Goats Suet and Opium, by which ſhe was cured perfectly. But we waſhed the part afterwards with ſtrengthening things warm, as ought to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtupefying Medicines have been applied.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſame <hi>Amatus,</hi> Curat. 6. Cent. 3. commends this following Topick in theſe words: <hi>A Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend man was grievouſly troubled with the Hemorrhoids; and after divers means uſed by Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians, was cured by us with this Medicine immediately.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take <hi>an Orange, and make it hollow, and fill it with Oyl of Roſes, and of Spike: then roaſt it, and apply it hot, repeated often, it is wonderful.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Lungs of a Goat are uſed commonly, applied hot to the part, or ſome ſlices made hot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Diſhes with a little VVater, to aſſwage pain.</p>
                     <p>Both the aforeſaid Ealſom of Sulphur, and theſe following Oyntments, are good for the Piles ulcerated.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>new Oyl of Eggs two ounces: Stir them in a Leaden Mortar, and apply them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take <hi>four ounces of Oyl of Roſes, and one ounce of Ceruſs: With half an ounce of Litharge, and ſix drams of new Wax, and four grains of Opium. Make an Oyntment.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Frankinſence, Myrrh, and Saffron, of each one dram: Opium two grains: One Yolk of an Egg; Oyl of Roſes, and Mucilage of Fleabane ſeeds, of each as much as will make an Oyntment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If they will not eaſily be diſſolved, you muſt open them after convenient Revulſions, rubbing them with a rough cloth dipped in the Juyce of Onions, in which there was diſſolved one dram of Aloes. This is <hi>Hartmans</hi> Secret. But they are ſoon opened, and with leſs pain, with a Pen-knife, or Horſ-leeches.</p>
                     <p>Some ſpecial things are taken by the Mouth to aſſwage pain, and conſume the Hemorrhoids. The chief are theſe:</p>
                     <p>The Decoction of Yarrow taken three daies as ordinary Drink, and the ſeed of three Leaved Graſs given many daies together with the Yolk of an Egg, is alſo excellent.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="319" facs="tcp:49088:153"/>The Pouder of Mullein given in Milk, or otherwiſe, is much approved againſt the Swelling of the Piles.</p>
                     <p>The Pouder of Yarrow and Tormentil, are commended to do the ſame.</p>
                     <p>The Juyce of Mullein by its ſelf, or mixed with Sugar of Roſes, or Penedies; or made into a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup with Sugar, is alſo excellent.</p>
                     <p>Finally, Pills of Bdellium taken often, do conſume the Piles, and take away the cauſe of them inſenſibly.</p>
                     <p>An Iſſue made in the Legg, is very good for them who are ſubject to this Diſeaſe.</p>

                        <hi>Chap. 1.</hi> Of the Hot Diſtemper of the Liver.</head>
                     <p>MAny men have a Hot Diſtemper of their Liver, from their Birth; of which here we ſhal not treat, but only of that preternatural Diſeaſe which manifeſtly hindereth the Actions of the Liver.</p>
                     <p>This Diſtemper is either Simple, or Compound; either with Matter, or without; but for the moſt part it hath Matter joyned with it, becauſe a Hot Diſtemper of the Liver uſeth to produce Hot and Chollerick Humors.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes of this Diſtemper are Hot Weather, immoderate Exerciſe, much Anger, and other great Paſſions of the Mind, and eſpecially hot nouriſhment, and Phyſick, or things Spiced, a pure and ſtrong Wine drunken plentifully: To theſe you may ad the Heat of the Part adjacent as in ſtrong Feavers, the Liver waxeth Hot from the heat of the Heart.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="321" facs="tcp:49088:154"/>The Signs of a Hot Diſtemper of the Liver, are Loathing of Meat, eſpecially Fleſh; Thirſt, bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Belly, vehement heat in the whol body, eſpecially in the palms of the hands and ſoles of the feet; leanneſs of the whol body, the Patient is worſe for hot things, and better for cold: and if there be plenty of hot Humors, there wil ſomtimes be Vomiting and purging of Choller; there is a bitterneſs in the mouth, and for the moſt part a Feaver.</p>
                     <p>As to the Prognoſtick, A Hot Diſtemper of the Liver is not very dangerous, becauſe it is not much contrary to the Conſtitution of the Liver, but it uſeth to be the Cauſe of many Diſeaſes not only of the Liver, but alſo of other parts: It is hard of Cure, eſpecially when the Stomach is cold, as often it is; for thoſe things which are given to Cool the Liver hurt the Stomach and enlarge its Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
                     <p>The Cure conſiſts altogether in the correction of the Diſtemper by cooling Medicines, and by the Evacuation of the Chollerick humors which comes from the Liver, encreaſing the Diſtemper, and that Diſtemper it, and is the Cauſe of other Diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>And firſt, Opening of a Vein doth much cool the Liver, takes away ſome of the Choller, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens the Obſtructions which comes from Choller; therefore you muſt open the Liver Vein of the Right Arm, and let ſuch a quantity of blood as is agreeable to the fulneſs and ſtrength of the Patient, either at once, or divers times, according to the greatneſs of the Diſeaſe and the continuance of it, and that after a Clyſter or Laxative Medicine hath been adminiſtred.</p>
                     <p>Then you muſt give a Medicine which doth gently Purge Choller, and Repeat it often at diſtance; or an Apozem for divers Doſes; or the Magiſtral Syrup, or Syrup of Succory, Compound with a four-fold proportion of Rhubarb which is moſt convenient, becauſe it doth innocently purge the Chollerick Humors, cooleth the Liver, ſtrengthneth it, and opens Obſtructions.</p>
                     <p>The Forms of theſe Medicines, are theſe that follow:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>clenſed Senna and Tamarinds, of each half an ounce: Annis ſeeds one dram: Succory and Sorrel, of each one handful: ſcraped Liquoris three drams: the three Cordial Flowers, of each half a pugil: boyl them to three ounces: and diſſolve in the ſtraining, of Rhubarb infuſed with a little Lavender Spike in Succory Water, one dram and an half: double Catholicon three drams: ſyrup of Roſes one ounce: make a Potion, give it in the morning with due cuſtody.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the finer ſort of People you may make Clarified Potions which are lately invented, which are in form of a Julep, but ſomwhat unpleaſant to the taſte, and in them there is preſcribed a double quantity of Purging Medicines becauſe the much ſtrength of them is loſt in the Clarifying, ſo that they do ſeldom work upon ſtrong bodies; eſpecially in a dry Country where the Humors are leſs flowing and not ſo obedient to purges; but in moiſt Countries, theſe kind of Medicines work ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
                     <p>This following is an Example of Clarified Potions.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>clean Senna one ounce: Annis ſeeds one dram: Succory Leaves and Maiden-Hair, of each one handful: ſcraped Liquoris half an ounce: boyl them to ten ounces, and infuſe in the ſtraining two drams of Rhubarb: Caſſia new drawn, and double Catholicon, of each one ounce: bruiſed Tamarinds half an ounce: Coriander ſeeds prepared one dram: ſyrup of Roſes one ounce: ſtrain them and clarifie them according to art: make a Potion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>An Apozeme to Purge Choller is thus made:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Sorrel, Dogs-tooth, Succory, and Dock Roots of each one ounce: Endive, Succory, Dandelion, and Maiden-hair, of each one handful: of the Four great ſeeds, of each three drams: ſcraped Liquoris one ounce: Succory, Bugloſs and Violet flowers, of each one pugil: clean Senna two drams: Tamarinds one ounce: Mace, and Cloves, of each one dram: boyl them to a Pint and a Quarter: in the ſtraining diſſolve half an ounce of Rhubarb infuſed in the aforeſaid De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction with a little Cinnamon, of compound ſyrup of Succory, and Roſes ſolutive, of each two ounces: make an Apozeme, clarifie it, and aromatize it with two drams of yellow Saunders, for four mornings draughts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A Magiſtral Syrup may be made of the ingredients of the former Apozeme, with a treble quantity of Purgers, and adding an equal proportion of Sugar to the Decoction.</p>
                     <p>A Syrup made of Juyces is moſt uſed amongſt us, it is of great power in Chronical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, which come from a Hot Diſtemper of the Liver, and from yellow and burnt Choller: And it is made thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the new made Juyces from their Faeces, of Endive, Succory, Sorrel, Fumatory, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and Bugloſs, of each three Pints: the Juyce of ſweet Apples newly drawn and purified two Pints: freſh Polypody of the Oak, half a pound: clean Senna eight ounces: Dodder of Thyme three ounces: Agarick newly Trochiſcated half an ounce: Mace and Cloves of each half a dram: infuſe them, and boyl them according to art while there remains one Pint and an half of the ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, in which diſſolve of Rhubarb infuſed with a little Lavender in the aforeſaid Juyces and ſtrained, one ounce: white Sugar one pound and an half: make a Syrup well boyled, clarified, and
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:49088:155"/>
aromatized with two drams of Triaſantalon: keep this ſyrup in a Glaſs: give two ounces at a time, or three, twice or thrice every month with Chicken Broth wherein Endivs, Succory, and Sorrel have been boyled; or in Whey.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe things following are excellent to cool the Liver. And firſt for ordinary Drink, uſe the common Ptiſan made of Barley Water and Liquoris, or with Dog-tooth and Sorrel Roots. Or mix ſuch a Decoction with Syrup of Lemmons, or Maiden-hair. Or they who are more dainty may take only the ſimple Spring Water, mixed with the aforeſaid Syrups. And if you deſire to cool more, you may put as much Spirit of Sulphur, or of Vitriol, as will make it a little ſharp. And when the heat is very vehement, you may give a dram of Lapis Prunellae therewith. There is alſo made a moſt pleaſant Drink of Conſerve of Roſes mixed with Spring Water and ſtrained: to which you may ad ſome drops of Spirit of Sulphur or Vitriol to make it ſharp and red like VVine.</p>
                     <p>You may alſo make a Tincture of Roſes thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>red Roſes dried one ounce: warm Water three pints: Spirit of Sulphur or Vitriol one dram and an half: Infuſe them three or four hours: add to it being ſtrained, three quarters of a pound of white Sugar. Keep it for your uſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Alexandrine Julep for this purpoſe, is made thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Spring Water one pint: Roſe Water, Juyce of Lemmons, and white Sugar, of each four ounces: Boyl them with a gentle fire till they are skinned.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe two laſt Remedies are uſed two waies, either for ordinary Drink, or as a Julep twice or thrice in a day.</p>
                     <p>Alſo divers Juleps to cool the Liver uſe to be preſcribed; of which, the Forms following may be Examples.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Sorrel, Succory, Dog-tooth, and Dock Roots, of each one ounce: Endive, Succory, Sorrel, and Maiden-hair, of each one handful: Succory, Bugloſs, and Borrage Flowers, of each one pugil: boyl them to a pint. In the ſtraining diſſolve Syrup of Lemmons three ounces: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>ake a cleer Julep for three Doſes, to be taken twice in a day. If you will make it cooler, add a little Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Sulphur or Vitriol to every Doſe to make it ſharp. And to make it colder yet, add a dram of Sal prunellae.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>VVhen Herbs are wanting, you may make a Julep of ſtilled VVaters thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Endive, Succory, and Sorrel Water, of each three ounces: Syrup of Lemmons, and Pomegrantes, of each one ounce and an half: Make a Julep for three Doſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You may alſo make Juleps that are good and pleaſant, of Juyces: an Example of all which, may be this that followeth:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Juyce of ſweet Apples newly drawn, and taken from the faeces, four ounces: the juyce of Lemmons three ounces: Roſe Water two ounces: the Juyce of Pomegranates one ounce: white Sugar half a pound. Make a Julep for three Doſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Inſtead of Juleps, Phyſick Broth may be made for the dainty folk, of the Herbs aforeſaid boyled with a Chicken. To which you may add one dram of Lapis Prunellae, that it may cool the better; or make it ſharp with ſome drops of Spirit of Vitriol.</p>
                     <p>Blood of Succory and Germander, brought into a Syrup as followeth, are good to clenſe the blood, open obſtructions, and cool the Liver.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Succory Water made in Balneo Mariae, as much as you pleaſe: the Leaves of Succory two parts: Germander one part: Steep them together, and digeſt them in Balneo Mariae three daies: then ſtrain them, and add to the Liquor, freſh Succory, and Germander: then digeſt them again three daies; then ſtrain them: and let this way of Infuſion be repeated eight or ten times. The Liquor will turn red like blood, to which you muſt put as much Sugar, and make it into a Syrup.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beſides, You may make Opiates and Tablets to cool the Liver, and ſtrengthen it, thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Conſerve of the Flowers of Succory, Violets, Water-lillies, and Bugloſs, of each one ounce: the pouder of the three Sanders one dram and an half. With Syrup of Lemmons make an Opiate to be taken often.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Lozenges of the three Sanders, with a double quantity of Rhubarb, four ounces. Let him take every morning two hours before meat, one of the weight of two drams.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Conſerve of Hips of the Canker Roſe, well clenſed, and boyled with Sugar into the Form of a Marmalade, doth powerfully cool the Liver, if the Patient taketh it inſtead of the former Opiate.</p>
                     <p>The Tincture of Coral, made with Juyce of Lemmons doth cool and ſtrenthen the Liver, if you give two ſpoonfuls thereof every day, or twice in a week at the leaſt.</p>
                     <p>A Bath of warm VVater uſed often, doth more powerfully and profitably cool and moiſten the Body than any other Remedy, eſpecially in lean folk.</p>
                     <p>VVhey is good for the ſame, if it be uſed fifteen daies, or more, together. It is made beſt by boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

the Milk, and powring in a little Vinegar or Juyce of Lemmons, and afterwards ſtraining it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Amatus Luſitanus</hi> prepareth it thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Whey one pint: very ſharp Syrup of Vinegar three ounces: Mix them, and after a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle boyling let it be taken as Mineral Waters, twice or thrice, and then walk upon it. The Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents took it five pints at a time.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quercetan</hi> prepareth it thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Whey two pints: Juyce of Lemmons two ounces: the new made Juyce of ſweet Apples three ounces. Clarifie them all together at the fire with the white of an Egg, and put to them a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Sugar. When it is ſtrained, take ſix or eight ounces every morning, for fifteen or twenty daies together.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And if the Body be lean and conſumed, you may give Milk alone, eſpecially if it be of an Aſs, for many daies.</p>
                     <p>The Decoction of China prepared with the Juyce of Lemmons, is alſo good for this purpoſe, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if there be Obſtructions. It is made thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>China Roots ſliced one ounce: Spring Water ſix pints: the Juyce of Lemmons three ounces: Steep them twenty four hours: then boyl them till the third part be conſumed; then ſtrain them through a Hippocras Bag, and let him take ſix ounces thereof morning and evening, and mix it with Wine when he pleaſeth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Mineral Waters that have Vitriol, are good, becauſe they open and cool.</p>
                     <p>If the Diſeaſe continue after all this, open the Hemorrhoids with Horſ-leeches once or twice in a month.</p>
                     <p>And alſo uſe outwardly Epithems and cooling Oyntments to the Region of the Liver.</p>
                     <p>Make Epithems of Sorrel, Succory, Roſe, or Plantane Water, or of Vinegar and Camphire: to which for the ſtrengthening of the part, add a little Pouder of the three Sanders.</p>
                     <p>The Oyntments are, <hi>Galens</hi> cooling Oyntment, and the Cerat of Sanders.</p>

                        <hi>Chap. 2.</hi> Of the Inflamation, Impoſthume, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer of the Liver.</head>
                     <p>THe Inflamation of the Liver, is a hot Tumor ariſing from Blood, which is out of its Veſſels, and ſent into the ſubſtance thereof.</p>
                     <p>And as the Blood is either pure, or mixed with other Humors, ſo doth it produce divers kinds of Tumors. For if it be pure, it makes a true Phlegmon; but if it be mixed with Choller, Flegm, or Melancholly, it produceth an Eryſipelous, Oedematous, or Schirrous Phlegmon. And if the ſaid Humors predominate over the Blood, there is a Phlegmonous Eryſipelas, oedema, and ſchirrus.</p>
                     <p>There is another difference in reſpect of the place in which the Inflamation is; it is either in the gibbous part, or Cavity of the Liver. Which is thus to be underſtood according to <hi>Galen, 5. de locis, aff. cap.</hi> 7. An Inflamation cannot be in either part of the Liver diſtinct, ſo that the other ſhal be free, becauſe the fleſh in the part is contained in all parts, and therefore when one part ſuffereth, the other alſo ſuffereth in ſome meaſure.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, That which <hi>Galen</hi> taught 13. Meth. Cap. 14. is worth obſervation: When the hollow part of the Liver is offended, it is neceſſary that the Inflamation reach to the Veins of the Meſentery, which come from the Gate Vein. And Experience teacheth that they who have died of this Infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation have had, not only an Impoſthume in the Liver, but alſo in the Meſentery.</p>
                     <p>VVe muſt alſo obſerve from <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> Aph. 45. Sect. 7. That an Impoſthume ſomtimes is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Membrane which covereth the Liver, and ſomtimes in the ſubſtance, or Parenchyma of it: <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they who have a hot Liver ſuppurated, if pure white quittor or matter flow from thence, do eſcape; for it is contained in the Tunicle: But if it be like Lees of Oyl, they die. Galen</hi> in his Comment, ſaith thus: <hi>They who have matter in the Tunicle of their Liver, and the ſubſtance not ſuffering, do all eſcape: but they who are corrupted in the very fleſhy ſubſtance of the Liver, die; and there is good reaſon to be given why they do.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The immediate Cauſes of this Diſeaſe are, too much Blood, or the boyling heat, thinneſs, and ſharpneſs of the ſame; or the motion and ſtirring of it in the Veins; from whence by the aforeſaid Cauſes, it is eaſily thrown into thoſe parts which are moſt fit to receive it. The Liver is moſt ſit to receive blood abounding when it is too hot, or hath any pain, for heat and pain do attract, or if it have any Natural or adventitious weakneſs: For all parts that are burdened with any Humor, do disburden themſelves upon the weakeſt. Among theſe Cauſes you may reckon the obſtruction of the Liver, by which the thick Humors are retained, and are inflamed by a Preternatural heat.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="324" facs="tcp:49088:156"/>The External Cauſes may be many, as too much heat of the body from immoderate Excerciſe, the Sun, or fire: but Meats ſharp and ſpiced, immoderate taking of two much ſtrong Wine, too much Letchery, Fear, a Stroak or Fall upon the Liver ſide, alſo hot Medicines applyed without reaſon thereto; as <hi>Fabricius Hildanus</hi> reports of one who having a cold diſtemper of the Stomach had Emplaiſters and hot Oyntments of Pepper, Cardamons, Oyl of Cloves, and the like applyed to him, by which means the Inflamation of the Liver was encreaſed: for the Liver covereth the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and the Medicines which are applied to the Stomach, do firſt touch the Liver with their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
                     <p>Cupping Glaſſes applied to the Region of the Liver wil do the ſame, of which <hi>Fabricius Hilda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> brings an Example concerning one who bled at the Noſe, to whom he applied great Cupping Glaſſes upon the Region of the Liver which ſtayed the blood; but a great Inflamation of the Liver followed.</p>
                     <p>The Signs of this Diſeaſe are many according to <hi>Galen</hi> and other Authors, which we ſhal lay down ſeverally, becauſe many errors are committed in the diſcovery thereof.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt Sign is Heavineſs in the right Hypochondrion which comes from the Repletion and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtention of the Liver; becauſe being of its own nature large and very compact, if it be filled with much Humor it wil grow very heavy: which the Patient apprehends when he tur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eth from one ſide to the other.</p>
                     <p>The Second Sign is Pain, which ſomtimes is perceived in one place, ſomtimes in two or three: in the Region of the Liver there is a weighty Pain; ſomtimes it is very extending in the lower Ribs when the Inflamation reacheth to the Ligaments of the Liver which are faſtned to the Ribs: ſomtimes the Pain is communicated to the Throat, by the continuation of the Membranes, which have conſent with the Membrane which covers the Liver.</p>
                     <p>The Third Sign is a Feaver, which is commonly at night, and is more or leſs ſharp according to the Humor offending: for in a Chollerick Inflamation it is moſt burning; but in a Flegmatick, gentle; and in a Sanguine Inflamation, moderate between both.</p>
                     <p>The Fourth Sign is Difficulty of Breathing, becauſe the Liver is tyed to the Diaphragma, or Midriff; and therefore by its weight forceth it downwards, as alſo preſſeth it with greatneſs and ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; ſo that both wayes the free motion of the Diaphragma is hindered.</p>
                     <p>The aforeſaid Signs are Univerſal or proper to declare the Diſeaſe: there are many other equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Signs, which alſo do much avail to the knowledge of the Diſeaſe: As a dry Cough, a hard Pulſe unequal, and like a Saw: the colour of the Tongue firſt red, and then black: great Loathing of meat: unquenchable Thirſt: vomiting of Choller, and ſomtimes of Flegm: a pale Colour of the whol Body tending to the Jaundice, yellowiſh: red and flaming Urin, which is ſharp: when the Patient lieth with his face upwards, he is more at eaſe than when he lieth on either ſide; becauſe when he lieth upon the right ſide the Liver is preſſed upon by the Stomach; when he lieth upon the left, it is extended by its own weight, hanging down; the Belly is bound, by reaſon of the Heat which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth al the moiſture of the Chylus matter: Somtimes it is looſe, namely, when a great weakneſs of the Liver is joyned with the inflamation; for then the Excrements are ſent forth moiſt like the Water wherein Fleſh hath been waſhed.</p>
                     <p>The Signs of the Differences are theſe; If the Gibbous or Convex part of the Liver be affected, there is a Tumor to be felt in the right Hypochondrion, and it makes the figure of the Liver like a half Moon: there is great pain in the Breathing, and it reacheth to the right ſide of the Throat, ſo that it ſeemeth to be pulled down: There is a greater Cough and Difficulty of Breathing, and greater weight.</p>
                     <p>But if the Hollow part of the Liver be affected, the Tumor is not ſo eaſily felt; but becauſe as I have ſaid, one part of the Liver cannot be inflamed, but the other muſt alſo ſuffer; when the part is touched and preſſed down, ſome pain is perceived.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, Becauſe this part lieth upon the Stomach, there is a greater loathing of Meat, vomiting, thirſt, and looſneſs of the Belly, from the food corrupted in the Stomach which is diſtempered by the neerneſs of the Liver to it.</p>
                     <p>The Signs of the Cauſes are theſe,</p>
                     <p>If the Inflamation come from pure Blood, there is either a perfect Red or duskiſh colour in the face; the Pulſe is great, ſoft, and wateriſh; the Urin is red and thick; the Body is full of fleſh: there is ſweetneſs in the mouth, the party is yong and hath fed high.</p>
                     <p>If Choller predominate, the Face is yellow, the Pulſe ſwift, hard, and unequal, the Urin thin and very yellow, ſomtimes flaming: the Body is lean and thin: the Eyes hollow: the Mouth bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: there is vomiting of Choller, and Cauſes that bred Choller went afore.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe the Inflamation of the Muſcles of the Abdomen or Belly is very like the Inflamation of the Liver, there we muſt diſtinguiſh them by their proper Signs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="325" facs="tcp:49088:156"/>In the Inflamation of the Muſcles of the Abdomen, the skin is ſo extended that if you lay hold of it you cannot move it; the humors of the ſtreight Muſcles are long and over the whol belly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the Navel: and the inflamation of other Muſcles is in the form of them. On the contrary, the Inflamation of the Liver is in the ſhape of the part affected; and if you lay hold on the Muſcles, they yeild and the Tumor is ſomwhat deeper.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, The color of the whol Body is of much concernment for the diſtinguiſhing of theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes; for in the Inflamation of the Muſcles, it is freſh, and almoſt in its Natural condition; but in the Inflamation of the Liver, it is pale, yellow, and like the Jaundice.</p>
                     <p>There is a famous Example of this in <hi>Galen, 5. de loc. aff. cap.</hi> 7. of one <hi>Steſianus,</hi> who when he was judged by other Phyſitians to have an Impoſthume in the Liver; <hi>Galen</hi> being ſent for, at the firſt view of his face, preſently ſaid that there was none, and ſearching his Belly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he found it in the Abdomen: He judged upon this ground, Becauſe the Patient had not his face ſo diſcolored, as uſeth to be in the Inflamation and Impoſthume of the Liver.</p>
                     <p>The like Example is in <hi>Valeriola,</hi> Lib. 4. Obſ. Cap. 5. of a certain Woman which was thought by another Phyſitian to have a Phlegmonous Tumor in the Liver. But ſaith he, <hi>When ſhe ſent for me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I judged it not to be ſo, but in the Muſcles.</hi> And a little after he ſaith, <hi>When I firſt came, I touched the place, and I found a long ſwelling in the right Hypochondria, down to the very Navel; the Face was red, freſh, and of a Roſie color, mixed with white, continuing all the time of the Diſeaſe in the ſame ſtate; the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine was very good, both in color, and in reſpect of the things contained: From all which it appeared, that not the Liver, but the Muſcles over it were affected; for when the Liver is affected, there is alwaies a diſcoloring of the face.</hi> For <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, that he knew ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſeaſed in their Livers by their colors, Lib. 5. de loc. aff. cap. 7. for the color in ſuch is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yellowiſh, white, and inclining ſomtimes to green.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, It is troubleſom to diſtinguiſh a Pleuriſie from an Inflamation of the Liver: as you may obſerve in <hi>Galen,</hi> 5. de loc. aff. cap. 7. in his Hiſtory of <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                           </gap>ilus</hi> the Phyſitian, who was decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in himſelf, ſuppoſing that he had a Pleuriſie; becauſe he had a Feaver, little and frequent brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, a ſmal Cough, and a pain neer the lower Ribs: but <hi>Galen</hi> by his ſtools, which were like water wherein fleſh had been waſhed, knew that his Liver was inflamed, for ſuch a flux doth ſhew that the Liver is greatly diſordered. But this ſign cannot alwaies diſtinguiſh a Pleuriſie from an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamation of the Liver. For as <hi>Galen</hi> teacheth in the place cited, ſuch kind of moiſt and bloody ſtools come only when the Liver is inflamed, when it is alſo very weak, otherwiſe one ſign of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver inflamed is (by <hi>Galen</hi>) coſtiveneſs. Therefore when the Liver is not weak, you muſt look for other ſigns, by which you may diſtinguiſh them.</p>
                     <p>If then the Inflamation be in the Pleura towards the right Hypochondria, the pain wil be vehement and pricking, the breath more difficult, there will be no change of color, the Cough will be greater, and not dry, but commonly (eſpecially in the encreaſe of the Diſeaſe) with bloody Spittle, ſomwhat at leaſt diſcolored; and laſtly, the Pulſe will be hard, and like a Saw: But in the Inflamation of the Liver, the pain is leſs, joyned with heavineſs, the color is yellowiſh, there is a dry Cough now and then, the Pulſe is not ſo hard; and laſtly, there is a Tumor in the right Hypochondrion.</p>
                     <p>And if the Inflamation be in the Meſentery, the Tumor will appear beneath the Region of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, there will be no change of color in the Face, the ſtools will be moiſt, in which at firſt there wil be thin and unconcocted Matter, afterwards concocted, in thoſe of whom there is hope of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
                     <p>The Prognoſtick of this Diſeaſe, is thus made:</p>
                     <p>Every Inflamation of the Liver is very dangerous, and for the moſt part deadly. And if it doth not kill preſently, it ends in a Dropſie, or Atrophy, or Conſumption. All the hope of recovery is from the ſtrength, as <hi>Galen,</hi> 10. meth. cap. 5.</p>
                     <p>An Inflamation of the Gibbous or bunchy part of the Liver, is more dangerous than that which is in the hollow part, by reaſon it is neerer the Heart, the Midriff, and hollow Vein.</p>
                     <p>An Inflamation coming from Choller, is more dangerous than that which cometh of pure Blood, becauſe then the Feaver is ſtronger, and other ſymptomes greater.</p>
                     <p>The Hiccoughs in an Inflamation of the Liver are evil, <hi>Hipp.</hi> Aph. 17. Sect. 7. For it ſhews the encreaſe of the Inflamation, and malignity, which doth by conſent diſturb the Stomach.</p>
                     <p>A Looſneſs joyned with an Inflamation of the Liver, is deadly, except the Matter voided be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted, and the flux be Critical.</p>
                     <p>If the Inflamation of the Liver cannot be diſcuſſed, as it ſeldom can, and if the Faculty be ſtrong, it turns into an Impoſthume; otherwiſe it turns into a Gangrene or Sphacelus. The Suppuration for the moſt part wil be within twenty daies. And this Impoſthume is very dangerous, and few e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape thereof. But if it be little, and only in one part of the Liver, and the matter white and even which comes forth by Urine or Stool, they eſcape. Alſo a Tumor in the Convex, or outward part of the Liver, which appears in the Skin as it were movable, may be opened with an actual Cautery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <pb n="326" facs="tcp:49088:157"/>
and if the Matter coming forth be pure and white, they eſcape, for the Matter is contained in the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle; but if it be like Lees of Oyl, they die.</p>
                     <p>After the Impoſthume is broken, if the Putient live, there remains an Ulcer, which is very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom to cure; and if it be not ſuperficial, it cauſeth a Dropſie or Maraſmus.</p>
                     <p>Alſo an Ulcer may be in the Liver from ſharp Humors that corrode it, eſpecially if they be chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick, and ſpread through the ſubſtance of the Liver, which putrifying by degrees, get a malig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>nt and venemous quality.</p>
                     <p>The knowledg of this Ulcer, which comes from the ſharpneſs of the Humors without Inflamation afore going, is difficult. But it may be known by ſome ſigns. And firſt, there is an ulcerous pain in the right Hypochondrion, and the Patient waxeth lean; and if it be in the hollow part of the Liver, there are ſtools with Pus or Matter, and ſomtimes with Blood, and pain of the Guts by reaſon of the ſharpneſs of the Humors, like a Dyſentery, which is diſtinguiſhed from this Diſeaſe in this, Becauſe there is a weight and pricking about the Liver. And ſomtimes Authors have obſerved that pieces of the Liver have been voided by ſtool. But if the Ulcer be in the gibbous or outward part, the Water is Mattery without any diſtemper of the Reins or Bladder. There is a ſmal Feaver in the encreaſe of the Diſeaſe, which turneth into an Hectick. The color is yellow, and ſomtimes there are ſmal puſtuls which come from the aduſtion of Humors in the Face. There is a loathing of Meat, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of fleſh, a ſtinking breath, and often fainting.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Prognoſtick, It bringeth a lingering Hectick Feaver.</p>
                     <p>And if the Ulcer be not ſmal, ſuperficial, and cured betimes, it is deadly.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe Exulcerations of the Liver which follow Inflamations and Impoſthumes, are more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than thoſe that ariſe without them.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of the Inflamation of the Liver, is the ſame with that of the Inflamation of the Stomach afore mentioned, and chiefly in reſpect of Phlebotomy, Purges and altering Remedies are to be given in the beginning of the Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>You muſt alſo give often Clyſters, ſuch as were preſcribed in the Inflamation of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.</p>
                     <p>But afterwards, cooling, clenſing, and opening Juleps, ſuch as were deſcribed in the Chapter afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, bewaring that they be not too ſweet, for by ſweet things, the Liver being inflamed, grows larger, as <hi>Trullian</hi> teacheth, Lib. 4. Cap. 10.</p>
                     <p>Let his Drink be the Decoction of Barley, Dog-tooth, with a little Liquoris, Syrup of Violets, or Maiden-hair.</p>
                     <p>In the Decoction you may ad to the former Juleps, the Roots of Smallage and Parſley, the Leaves of Agrimony, Maiden-hair, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And afterwards Turpentine, waſhed Agrimony, or Parſley Water given twice or thrice, takes away the reliques of the Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>But if the Diſeaſe be ſtubborn, and laſt long, you muſt preſcribe an Apozeme of opening and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſening things, thus:</p>

                     <p>Hence it is that Obſtruction is an Organical Diſeaſe, namely, in the way and paſſage obſtructed, which hinders the diſtribution of Blood for the Nouriſhment of the parts. Theſe waies or paſſages are not only the Veins which are diſperſed through the whol ſubſtance of the Liver; but alſo the Pores and inſenſible Paſſages, with which the whol ſubſtance of the Liver, and alſo of other parts, is very full; which being ſhut up by a preternatural Humor; neither can the heat of the Liver be coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, nor can the thin vaporous Excrements be evacuated.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="328" facs="tcp:49088:158"/>The Matter that Cauſeth the Obſtructions, commonly is a groſs Excrement, viſcous and clammy, which being not able to paſs freely, ſticks in the paſſage, and is more and more thickned by the heat of the part, ſo that the longer Obſtructions continue, the worſe they are.</p>
                     <p>Somtimes plenty of Humors cauſe an Obſtruction, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſheweth, 10. meth. cap. 2. in there words, <hi>Of Obſtructions ſome come of abundance of Humors, and ſome from the Quality, as when they are groſs or clammy; Blood letting is the beſt Remedy againſt thoſe which come from plenty, and the uſe of attenuating things is beſt againſt thoſe that come of Quality.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Obſtruction which comes from plenty of Humors, happens chiefly in the Veſſels and their cavities when being too full, they are ſo diſtended, that they cannot contract themſelve for the ſending forth of the Matter contained: As we may obſerve by the Bladder when it is ſtretched ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> by long retention of too much Urin, that it cannot contract it ſelf; from whence there comes a ſtoppage of Urin, or difficulty of voiding thereof.</p>
                     <p>Not only Humors, but alſo ſomtimes many groſs Vapors, which cannot eaſily be diſcuſſed (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the way is not open, as in the Chollick) may be the Cauſe of Obſtruction, as <hi>Galen</hi> teacheth, 3. de loc. aff. which Cauſes are very rare, and abſolutely denyed of ſome.</p>
                     <p>The Humors which ſtoppeth with its thickneſs is chiefly Flegm, which wil eaſily grow groſs and clammy. Melancholly is next, which by its coldneſs, thickneſs, and droſſineſs, may cauſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions: Alſo Blood may do the ſame by its quantity and thickneſs: And laſtly, Choller ſtaying long in the Liver grows thick, and breeds dangerous Obſtructions. The Antecedent and Princ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>pal Cauſes, are al things that produce thick and clammy Humors, and thick and cloudy Air, Meats of groſs Juyce, viſcous, hard of Concoction, and diſtribution, aſtringent, cold, and not fit for to be eaten, as Pears, quinces, Services, Medlars, Muſhrooms, Cheeſe, Pulſe, Peaſe or Beans, Beef and Pork, ſlymy Fiſh, and dryed in the ſmoak, Bread not wel baked, Rapes, Cheſsnuts, thick, red, and aſtringent Wine, and muddy Ale.</p>
                     <p>Alſo an evil Diſpoſition of the Liver, eſpecially a cold diſtemper, which may alſo produce Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions from good Juyce, as when it doth not wel Concoct, but turns the meat into a ſalt tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and mucilagnous or ſlymy Matter.</p>
                     <p>Alſo the Diſtemper of the Stomach may be a Cauſe of Obſtructions, when it begets too crude a Chyle, which cannot after be wel ordered by the Liver, becauſe the ſault of the firſt Concoction is not amended by the ſecond.</p>
                     <p>The Signs of this Diſeaſe are to be divided into divers ſorts, ſome ſignifie the kind of the Diſeaſe, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the part affected, and others the cauſe that produce it.</p>
                     <p>The Signs that ſhew the kind of the Diſeaſe are common to al natural parts that are ſubject to Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions: for they ſhew only Obſtructions lying in the lower Belly, and theſe therefore wil ſerve for the knowledg of the Obſtructions of the Spleen, and Meſentery eſpecially.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Signs ſhew that there are Obſtructions in the ſaid parts,</p>
                     <p>The Excrements of the Belly being out of their natural condition, eſpecially when they are moiſt, white, chylous, or bloody: white Urine, thin and watery, and as it were ſtrained, becauſe the thicker parts cannot paſs through by reaſon of the Obſtructions, but only the pure water comes through un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed; and it may be yellow if there be heat.</p>
                     <p>Difficulty of Breathing, eſpecially when the Patient walketh faſt, or goes up a hill, or pair of ſtairs, becauſe the parts obſtructed do draw the Midriff down-wards, and hinder its free motion; the Face is pale; there is leanneſs and dulneſs over the whol body; the Pulſe is unequal; and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there is ſuch a ſenſe of weight in the Hypochondria as they who have been feeding very hard; Therefore <hi>Hippocrates, 4. de victus ratione in acut.</hi> calls that heavines a fulneſs of the Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, attributing that Diſeaſe to the Hypochondria, which properly belongs to the Stomach: for as often as the Spleen and Liver are filled with evil Humors, and ſwel, they are preſſed and feel a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs, after the leaſt eating of the lighteſt meats, as they who have over-gorged themſelves. This Sign doth ſo ſurely declare the Obſtruction of the Hypochondria, although there be neither pain nor apparent ſwelling, that <hi>Prosper Martianus</hi> in his Comment upon the aforeſaid Book of <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> aſſirmeth, That he hath concluded that the Bowels were obſtructed, before ever he handled the Hypochondria.</p>
                     <p>The ſtretching of the right Hypochondrion ſheweth the part affected, together with the other ſigns, and ſomtimes pain, that is heavy and dul, which encreaſeth after meat, eſpecially if exerciſe immediately follow; ſomtimes a dry Cough; difficulty of Breathing by reaſon of the neerneſs of the Diaphragma, and a greater weight of that part than of any other.</p>
                     <p>The Signs of the Cauſes are if it come from Humors, the pain is more heavy, extending and fixed: if from Wind, it is ſharper and more moveable: if from cold Humors, there is more ſenſe of weight in the right ſide, the Face is more pale; there is no Feaver nor thirſt; there was a cold and thick diet without exerciſe that preceded: if it comes from hot Humors, there is leſs weight, more thirſt, the
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:49088:158"/>
Face is yellow by reaſon of Choller, or red by reaſon of Blood, there is a Feaver and a pricking pain ſomtimes, and hot diet went before.</p>
                     <p>The Prognoſtick of this Diſeaſe is to be made thus,</p>
                     <p>A New Obſtruction is eaſily taken away, an Old hardly.</p>
                     <p>An Obſtruction of the Liver, except it be ſpeedily and wholly taken away, uſeth to bring many Evils, namely, Putrefaction of Humors, Feavers, Inflamations, divers Fluxes of the Belly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and vehement, becauſe the nouriſhment can paſs to the parts: the Chollick, Jaundice, Evil Habit of body, Dropſie, Scirrhus, and other infinite Diſeaſes, ſo that <hi>Avicenna</hi> calls Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the Mother of Diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>An Obſtruction made by Humors, is worſe than that which comes of Wine.</p>
                     <p>That which comes of Crude and Flegmatick Humors, or of Wind, is ſomtimes cured by a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; becauſe the Heat doth diſcuſs the Flatus, or Wind; makes Flegm thin, and more apt to flow.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of an Obſtruction is to be begun with an univerſal Evacuation of the whol body; by a Potion agreeable to the nature of the Diſeaſe: Afterwards if there be ſigns of Plethory or ſulneſs, and if the body be not very thin, you muſt draw blood out of the Liver Vein in the Right Arm.</p>
                     <p>Then preſcribe this Apozeme,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Smallage, Parſley, and Fennel Roots, infuſed a whol night in white Wine, of each one ounce: the Roots of the greater Celandine, two ounces: Fearn Roots, Elicampane barks, the Roots of Capars, the inward bark of an Aſh, and Tamarisk, of each half an ounce: Wormix ood, Agrimony, Maiden-hair, Germander, the tops of Saint Johns-wort, and the Leſſer Centaury, of each one handful: Smallage, Parſley, annis, and Fennel ſeeds, of each half an onnce: clean Senna, Polypody of the Oak, and the Kernels of Carthamus ſeeds, of each two ounces: Epythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum, or Dodder of thyme, one ounce: Ginger and Cloves, of each one dram: the flowers of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marisk, Marigolds, and Red Fitches, of each one pugil: make a Decoction to a Pint and a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, diſſolve in the ſtraining of the Syrup of the Five Roots, and of Roſes Solutive, of each two ounces: make an Apozeme, clarified and aromatized with two drams of Cinnamon for four mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings draughts, adding to every Doſe one dram of Cream of Tartar, ſalt of Wormwood and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marsk, of each half a ſcruple.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the laſt Doſe (if the firſt hath not ſufficiently purged) diſſolve of the Electuary of Citrons Solutive and Diacarthamum, of each one dram and an half.</p>
                     <p>Somtimes we put white Wine in the Decoction before mentioned. Somtimes a little Vinegar, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of the Patient.</p>
                     <p>If the Patient be dainty, and will not take an Apozeme, inſtead thereof you ſhal give theſe Broths,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Smallage, Parſley, and Sparagus Roots, of each half an ounce: Agrimony, Hyſop, Maidenhair, of each one handful Criſtal of Tartar one dram: boyl them with a Chicken or a neck of Mutton, make Broth for nine dayes together every morning.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Criſtal of Tartat diſſolved in new made Broth and ſtrained is better, for when the Decoction is cold, for the moſt part it congealeth again, and is ſeparated from it: and when you give it in the Broth, you muſt ſtir it about well with a Silver Spoon afore it be taken, or you will leave the greater part in the bottom of the Diſh.</p>
                     <p>Every other day, infuſe in his Broth, half an ounce of Senna and one dram of Annis ſeeds.</p>
                     <p>As long as he taketh theſe Medicines, and after, as often as need requires, let the Region of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſomented every morning one hour before he taketh his Broth, and every evening one hour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Supper, with this following Fomentation:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Marſh-mallow, and Briony Roots, of each one ounce and an half: the Roots of Dane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort, Cypreſs, Eryngus, the Barks of the Roots of Capars, and the middle rind of Tamarisk, of each one ounce: the Leaves of Mallows, Marſh-mallows, Violets, Agrimony, Germander, Mints, and Wormwood, of each one handful: Lin-ſeed, Foenugreek, and Juniper Berries, of each half an ounce: Coriander ſeeds, and yellow Sanders, of each three drams: Broom, Elder, Chamomel, and Melilot flowers, of each one pugil: boyl them all in two parts of Chalybeate Water, and one of white Wine, added in the end: and when it is ſtrained, add half a pint of Vinegar: Foment the part as aforeſaid.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After the Fomentation, let the part be anointed with the following Oyntment.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Oyl of Lillies and Capars, of each two ounces: the Juyce of the Roots of Briony and Smallage, of each three ounces: Boyl them till the Juyces are conſumed, adding the Oyntment of Marſh-mallows, and Gum Ammoniack diſſolved in Vinegar, and ſtrained, of each one ounce: Carrot ſeeds and Spicknard, of each one dram and an half: yellow Wax as much as will make an

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe it as aforeſaid, adding in the time of anointing, a little Vinegar of Roſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After the uſe of theſe Remedies, this Opiate following is good to wear away the reliques of the Obſtructions, and recover ſtrength to the part.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Conſerve of Wormwood, Maiden-hair, and the Flowers of Tamarisk, of each one ounce: the Conſerve of Elicampane Roots, and Citron peels candied, of each half an ounce: one candied Myrobalan: candied Nutmegs three drams: Confection Alkermes two drams: the Pouder of Diarrhodon Abbatis, one dram: Salt of Wormwood, and Tamarisk, of each two ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: Saffron one ſcruple: Amber-greece half a ſcruple: with the Syrup of Citrons make an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate, of which let him take the bigneſs of a Cheſnut every morning two hours before meat, and drinking after it, a little Hippocras.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Warm Baths are alſo very good, in which ſoftening and opening things have boyled.</p>
                     <p>If the Obſtructions are very ſtubborn, theſe following Pills are very good.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the beſt Aloes infuſed in the Joyce of Wormwood very well, half an ounce: Gum Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack diſſolved in Vinegar and ſtrained, three drams: Myrrh diſſolved in warm Wine, and ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, two drams: the pouder of the three Sanders, and Cryſtal of Tartar, of each one ſcruple: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garicknewly made into Troches, and of the beſt Rhubarb, of each two drams: the Salt of Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood and Tamarisk, of each half a dram: Saffron half a ſcruple: With the Syrup of Roſes ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutive, make a Moſs of Pills, of which let him take half a dram two hours before dinner twice in a week.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Inſtead of the Apozeme aforeſaid, you may make an old Cock Broth, when the Obſtructions are old and ſtubborn.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Polypody of the Oak, and Carthamus ſeeds, of each one ounce and an half: the tops of Time and Epithimum, of each one pugil: Annis, Fennel, and Caraway ſeeds, of each two drams: clean Senna two ounces: Cryſtal of Tartar half an ounce: beat them, and fill the Belly of an old Cock therewith: boyl them in three parts of Water, and one of white Wine, till the fleſh of the Cock fall from the Bones. Make Broth, and let the Patient take it four mornings.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or (which is better) make a Decoction for one draught every day of the fourth part of the Ingredients.</p>
                     <p>To this Broth you may ad Herbs, and opening Roots in a ſmal quantity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quercetan</hi> commends exceedingly in his Diſpenſatory, the Compound Pouder of the Root of Cuckoo-pintle, to open Obſtructions; of which you may give two drams for divers daies together, in a convenient Decoction.</p>
                     <p>But of all Remedies, to take away old Obſtructions, Medicines made of Tartar, Vitriol, and Steel, are the beſt.</p>
                     <p>Of Tartar there is made Cryſtal, Salt, and Spirit, which are to be given in divers forms.</p>
                     <p>The uſe of Cryſtal of Tartar is formerly mentioned in the Apozeme, and Phyſick Broths, made either of a Chicken, or old Cock.</p>
                     <p>Concerning this Medicien, yong Phyſitians are to be admoniſhed, that it is of more-force than it is commonly ſuppoſed to be, although we ſeldom obſerve it in Practice, by reaſon of the negligence of Apothecaries, the deceit of falſe Chymiſts, and vulgar Diſtillars, which ſtill Chymical Medicines to the Apothecaries, of which, few are good, but moſt adulterate.</p>
                     <p>The negligence of Apothecaries for the moſt part is, That they had rather buy Cryſtal of Tartar of ſuch fellows, than make it themſelves (though it be the eaſieſt of all) becauſe they ſell it chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per than they themſelves can make it: for thoſe Impoſtors wil ſell a pound for ſeven pence, or eight pence, from which alone the Apothecaries might argue deceit, perceiving that they would be looſers in ſo ſelling, if it were rightly made.</p>
                     <p>The deceit lieth here, Thoſe Impoſtors put a little Tartar, and a great deal of Allum into their Decoctions; not becauſe Tartar is ſold dearer, but becauſe it yields but a little Cryſtal; but Allum will run all into Cryſtal. Hence it is that the Phyſitians are deceived of their intentions, becauſe Allum is aſtringent, which is contrary to the opening Faculty which they deſire.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, There is another wrong done to this Medicine, when it is made in a Braſs Kettle, which leaves a malignant quality upon the Medicine; for it is a known and vulgar ſaying among Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, You muſt not boyl ſharp things in Braſs Veſſels, becauſe they eaſily pierce, and attract a noxious Tincture from them. But the Cryſtals of Tartar are moſt ſharp, called by ſome <hi>Acidum Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tari,</hi> or the ſharpneſs of Tartar.</p>
                     <p>This Error is often made by Apothecaries; and almoſt all they who make this Cryſtal themſelves uſe Braſs Veſſels, ſo that I have ſeen ſome Tartar look Skie-colored from the Verdugreece which it hath taken from the Copper. Therefore Phyſitians ſhall do conſcienciouſly, honorably, and for the good of their Patients, if they cauſe their Apothecaries to make Cryſtal of Tartar themſelves, and in Glaſs, Iron, or Earthen Veſſels glaſſed.</p>
                     <p>The Salt of Tartar hath great power to open Obſtructions, and may well be mixed with Apozems,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:49088:159"/>
Opiates, and opening Pills. But the chief uſe of it is in a looſening Ptiſan, or Barley Water, made of two drams of Senna, infuſed in eight ounces of cold Water, with one ſcruple, or half a dram of Salt of Tartar, by which the Tincture of the Senna will be powerfully extracted; ſo that this Ptiſan ſhal work better than any ordinary one; and continued many daies it takes away all Obſtructions: we have ſeen Quartan Agues cured, by the uſe of it fifteen daies together. If you fear the ſharpneſs of the Salt of Tartar, you may correct it with the Spirit of Sulphur, or of Vitriol, putting fifteen drops of Spirit, to half a dram of Salt.</p>
                     <p>You may find the uſe of the Spirit of Tartar in our Obſervations for the Cure of the Dropſie, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Title of a Diuretical Spirit.</p>
                     <p>Of Vitriol, only the Oyl or Spirit is uſed in Apozemes, Syrups, and other Forms of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines.</p>
                     <p>This following Syrup, which is good againſt all Obſtructions of the Liver, Meſentery, and Veins, may be for an Example, by which, many through continual Feavers falling into evil Habits and Dropſies, have been perfectly cured.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Roots of Smallage, Elicampane, Sparagus, Eringus, of each one ounce: Leaves of Agrimony, Ceterach, Maiden-hair, Dodder, Carduus, of each one handful: the tops of Sea Wormwood, and of the leſſer Centaury: of each half a handful: Winter Cherries one ounce: Spring Water ſix pints: boyl them till two pints of the ſtraining remain; in which diſſolve of the Juyce of Succory, and Burnet refined, of each one pint: the juyce of Fumitory and Hops, of each ſix ounces: Fennel and Parſley juyce, of each three ounces: Vinegar of Squils one pint and an half: white Sugar ſix pound: make a Syrup, to which add of the Oyl of Vitriol as much as will make it ſharp; of which let the Patient take three ſpoonfuls before Break-faſt, and as much before Dinner and Supper.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Natural ſharp Baths ſhew the Efficacy of Vitriol, the uſe whereof is frequent and profitable in all Diſeaſes coming of Obſtructions.</p>
                     <p>But the Spirit of Vitriol mixed with the Salt or Spirit of Tartar, is much commended by the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, and of them they make Tartar Vitriolate, and that rare mixture of Spirit of Vitriol, Tartar, and Treacle which may be mixed with other openers.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, There are divers Medicines made of Steel, both by Galeniſts, and Paracelſians, which plainly opening Obſtructions preſently, compel al men to uſe them, even thoſe who reject all Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines made of Mettals, as Enemies to our Natures.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Medicines of Steel are made either in the Form of Wine, Syrups, Opiates, Pills, or Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zenges.</p>
                     <p>Steeled Wine is made thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Filings of Steel four ounces: Eryngo Roots, and Elicampane, of each one ounce and an half: yellow Sanders one ounce: red Coral and ſhavings of Ivory, of each ſix drams: Cloves, Nutmeg, and Cinnamon, of each two drams: Flowers of Broom, Roſemary, and Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thimum, of each two pugils: the beſt white Wine ſix pints: ſteep them eight daies in Balneo Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae, or behind an Oven: then ſtrain them through a Hippocras bag, and let the Patient take two or three ounces every morning two hours before meat for fifteen daies, or more if need require.</hi> Or make it thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Steel prepared with Sulphur, one ounce: Elicampane, and the middle rind of Tamarisk, of each half an ounce: Senna three ounces: Epithimum one ounce: Foecula Brioniae, and Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon, of each two drams: Pouder of the three Sanders, one dram and an half: Agrimony Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and white Wine, of each one pint: Infuſe them three daies in Balneo Mariae. Let him take three or four ounces when it is ſtrained, three hours before meat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Commonly they uſe the Infuſion of Steel in white Wine, or Claret, for ordinary Drink, with much Water for two or three months together.</p>
                     <p>You may make a Syrup of Steel thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Filings of Steel ſteeped in Vinegar, two ounces: the inward rind of Tamarisk half an ounce: Ceterach half a handful: Cinnamon three drams: Wormwood and Agrimony Water, of each half a pint: white Wine one pint: Infuſe them ſix daies in a warm place: add to the ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Sugar one pound and an half: make a Syrup.

                     </p>
                     <p>For the Preparation aforeſaid of Steel, you muſt ſteep it in Vinegar in the Sun, while the Vinegar is conſumed three times, and then grind it upon a Marble.</p>
                     <p>This Syrup may be made Purging, and better, if you diſſolve the Sugar with a pint of Water where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in three ounces of Senna, and half an ounce of Rhubarb have been ſteeped a whol night.</p>
                     <p>The Pouder of Steel is made thus, taken out of <hi>Quercetan</hi>'s Diſpenſatory.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the ſhavings of Steel, either commonly prepared, or with Sulphur, one ounce: the faecula of the Root of Cuckow-pintle one dram and an half: Amber-greece half a dram (for the Poor, a

                     </p>
                     <p>To theſe Pills you may ad according to the kind of the Diſeaſe and the Patients occaſion, of Gum Ammoniack, Sagapenum, Opopanax, Myrrh, Gentian, Birth-wort, Maſtich, Nutmeg, and the like.</p>
                     <p>In all Medicines made of Steel, this is alwayes to be obſerved, That Exerciſe be uſed after them, as Walking, to make the ſtrength of the Medicine to go into the parts obſtructed: This Walking muſt befor two hours after; after which give a little Broth, in which opening Herbs and Roots have been boyled.</p>
                     <p>Beſides al theſe Remedies, the Chymiſts commend Mercurial Purges, of Mercurius dulcis, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally given with ordinary Pills, or Extracts, becauſe Mercury doth violently penetrate, and open Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Bezoard</hi> Mineral is very much commended, and given with Mercurius dulcis: You may give it thus made.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Bezoard mineral twelve grains: Mercurius dulcis ſix grains: conſerve of Roſes one or two drams: make a Bolus which muſt be given many dayes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If there be an Obſtruction of the Liver in a Chollerick body, with a hot and dry diſtemper of the part, then muſt you give cooling or temperate Openers, which ſhal be ſhewed in the Cure of Flatus Hypochondriacus, mentioned among the Diſeaſes of the Spleen.</p>
                     <p>For his ordinary drink let him take Water and ſmal Wine wherein Steel hath been infuſed: Or, a weak Decoction of Tamarisk, Agrimony, Ceterach, Maiden-hair, Burnet, all or ſome with Wine,</p>
                     <p>Some commend the Infuſion of the Wood againſt the Stone called Lignum Nephriticum for ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary drink: Others the Decoction of Eglentine or Sweet-bryer which opens very powerfully, and ſtrengtheneth; and they ſay that many have been Cured of deſparate Diſeaſes by that alone.</p>
                     <p>But the Infuſion of the filings of Steel made in white Wine, or thin red Wine, doth open better mixed with the aforeſaid Waters, or with ordinary Water: for by this Medicine alone many Virgins have been Cured of the Green Sickneſs, and this Wine wil work better, if they take every morning two ounces of cleer Wine, beſides the ordinary drink.</p>

                        <hi>Chap. 4.</hi> Of the Jaundice.</head>
                     <p>THe Jaundice is a yellow color of the whol Body, coming of Choller, ſpread over all the Skin.</p>
                     <p>It is therefore a Symptome of the Quality changed. And now preſently, that vulgar difficulty which is controverted by almoſt all Writers, offers it ſelf; namely, That the yellow color in the Cornea, doth immediately hurt the Sight, making all objects appear yellow. To which (that I may anſwer in a word, without circumſtances) I ſay, That it is a diſeaſe in the encreaſe of Number; for ſince the Cornea ought to be void of all color, that it may let the Species of Objects paſs through pure and unchanged, if it have any pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ernatural color, it hath a Diſeaſe in the encreaſe of Number, that is, more than what is neceſſary to the Natural Conſtitution thereof.</p>
                     <p>Authors do make two ſorts of Jaundice; Yellow, and Black. The Black proceeds from the Spleen and is very rare: therefore here treating only of the Diſeaſes of the Liver, we will ſpeak only of the Yellow Jaundice.</p>
                     <p>The ſpreading of Choller upon the Skin, comes from many Cauſes; which may be reduced to three Heads: namely, An Evil Diſpoſition of the Liver; An Obſtruction of the Bag that contains the Gall; And the malignity of the Chollerick Humor.</p>
                     <p>The Evil Diſpoſition of the Liver is divers; as Dſtemper, Inflamation, Obſtruction, Schirrus, and whatſoever may ſo weaken the part, that Excrementitious Choller cannot be ſeparated from the Blood, but is with it diſtributed through the whol Body.</p>
                     <p>The Obſtruction of the Bag or Cyſtis, which contains the Gall, hinders the paſſage of it into the Guts, whereby it remains in the Liver, and goes from thence with the Blood into the whol Body. This Obſtruction is either from groſs Flegm, or Choller abounding; ſomtimes from little ſtones which are often bred in the Bag of Gall; which may alſo be made narrow in the Paſſage, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of ſome part nigh unto it, which is inflamed or ſchirrous.</p>
                     <p>The Evil of the Chollerick Humor conſiſts, either in the great quantity thereof, which cannot be regulated by Nature, nor be ſeparated from the Maſs of Blood, or which ſo filleth the Bag of the Gall, that it cannot contract it ſelf to expel it; or it conſiſts in an evil quality, which by corrupting of the Humors, doth hinder their due Evacuation, or ſtirs up Nature ſuddenly to caſt it forth, as you may obſerve in a Critical or Symptomatical Jaundice. This Corruption happens in continual Chollerick Feavers; as alſo after Poyſon is taken, or from the biting of ſome venemous Creature, by which the whol Blood is turned into Choller.</p>
                     <p>The Signs of the Yellow Jaundice are manifeſt; namely, a yellow color through the whol Body, eſpecially in the white of the Eyes. Alſo an itching, and lazineſs, bitterneſs of the Tongue, ſomtimes Chollerick Vomitings, and Hiccoughs.</p>
                     <p>The Signs of the Cauſes are to be taken from their proper Fountains; for if the diſtemper of the Liver be hot, this Diſeaſe comes from Inflamation, Obſtruction, Schirrus, or the like: the knowledg of which is to be taken from their proper Chapters.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things properly ſhew the Obſtruction of the Bag of the Gall, white Excrements, and a Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bound through the want of Choller, which uſeth to make the Excrements yellow, or red, and to ſtir up the Expulſive Faculty of the Guts like a Clyſter. The Urine is very yellow, inclining to red and if you put a Linnen clout therein, it will dye it yellow.</p>
                     <p>If it come from the malignity of the Chollerick Humor, the Excrements of the Belly are high colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and alſo the Urine, eſpecially if it follow a putrid Feaver, when the Jaundice is a Symptome, and then after the coming of the Jaundice the Feaver remains: but if it be critical, the Feaver ceaſeth, and the Excrements with the Urine are wel colored. The External Cauſes, as Poyſon, and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous bitings may be declared by the Patient, and thoſe about him.</p>
                     <p>The Prognoſtick of the Jaundice is various, according to the variety of Cauſes.</p>
                     <p>That is more Curable which comes from the Obſtruction of the Bag containing the Gall, becauſe its paſſages are neerer the Guts, and the Matter cleaving thereto, is eaſily ſent into them, provided that the Obſtruction come not from a ſtone, which becauſe it cannot be diſſolved, renders the Diſeaſe incurable.</p>
                     <p>The Jaundice coming from an Inflamation or Schirrus of the Liver, is moſt dangerous; for one commonly ends in an Impoſthume, the other in a Dropſie.</p>
                     <p>They who in a Feaver, have the Jaundice before the ſeventh day, are deſperate, <hi>Hipp.</hi> Aph. 62. Sect. 4. againſt which Aphoriſm, there is another of, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> oppoſed, which is in 4. <hi>de victus ratione in acutis,</hi> in theſe words: <hi>In a Chollerick Feaver, if the Jaundice come before the ſeventh day, with chillneſs, the Diſeaſe is cured; but if it come without chillneſs, it is deadly.</hi> There is
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:49088:161"/>
Reaſon for what he ſaith; for when in the third, fourth, and fifth day, the Criſis (or ground of Judgment) is healthful, if it be by Sweat, Urine, or Stool, why ſhould not a Critical Jaundice fall upon thoſe daies? And Experience from many allowed Authors doth teſtifie that the Jaundice doth often happen with ſafety before the ſeventh day. Now theſe Authors do interpret the aforeſaid Aphoriſm thus; namely, That <hi>Hippocrates</hi> by the ſeventh day, underſtands any Critical day, and he mentioneth the ſeventh as the moſt noble day, and to be taken for all the reſt. But that is a true Critical Day of Judgment, afore which, a ful Concoction of the Matter cauſing the Feaver, did appear.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of the Jauudice, is by taking away of the Cauſes: For if it come from a hot diſtemper of the Liver, or a Tumor in that part, you muſt conſult with the Chapters afore mentioned for the Cure of them.</p>
                     <p>But that which comes upon acute Feavers, if it be Critical needs no Cure. Yet if it be Sympto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical, the Cure of it depends upon the Cure of the Diſeaſe upon which it depends.</p>
                     <p>That which comes from the Obſtruction of the Cyſtis, or Bag of the Gall, is cured by taking away of the Obſtruction, which may be conveniently done by the Remedies mentioned in the former Chapter. To which we may add theſe as more proper.</p>
                     <p>Firſt take away part of the Humor with this following Bolus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Electuary of the Juyce of Roſes, and Diaprunis ſolutive, of each three drams: the pouder of Rhubarb one dram: Saffron half a ſcruple: With Sugar make a Bolus; which you may give once or twice, if the Body be of a very ill habit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for Phlebotomy, though <hi>Galen</hi> denyeth it, as unprofitable, yet if you perceive abundance of Blood, it is very good to abate it.</p>
                     <p>After general Medicines this following Infuſion uſed ſix or ſeven daies, doth commonly pluck this Diſeaſe up by the Roots, if it be but yong.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Madder Roots half an ounce: the greater Celandine one handful: the tops of Sea Wormwood, and of the leſſer Centaury, of each one pugil: Cinnamon half a dram: Saffron half a ſcruple: Infuſe them a whol night in eight ounces of white Wine, and add to the ſtraining half an ounce of white Sugar. Let him take it in the morning three hours before dinner.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or you may make this Decoction following:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Celandine Roots and Leaves one handful: the Leaves and Flowers of St. Johns wort, of each half a handful: the ſhavings of Ivory and poudered Gooſe dung, of each three drams: Saffron half a dram. Put the Pouder of Gooſe dung and the Saffron in a clout, and boyl them all in equal parts of white Wine, and Wormwood Water to one pint: and when it is ſtrained, add one ounce of Sugar. Give it for three morning draughts, and repeat it if you think ſit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quercetan</hi> commends for this purpoſe, the Dung of a green Gooſe that eats Graſs in the Spring; and the dried white Dung of an Hen, given or divers daies to the quantity of half a dram or a dram; and he ſaith that the Dung of theſe Aerial Creatures, is full of Nitre and Sulphur, and hath a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Faculty to cut, attenuate, and diſſolve.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> commends the Juyce of Horehound for this Diſeaſe, and ſince his time, others, and eſpecially <hi>Foreſtus,</hi> who reports that ſome were only cured by the uſe of the Syrup of the Juyce of Horehound, when other means failed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Geſner</hi> commends the Nettle Root thus prepared:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Nettle Roots one pound: Saffron one ſcruple: beat them wel, and take out their Juyce with white Wine, and let the Patient take four ounces every morning for four or five daies, and cover himſelf to ſweat after it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>While inward Medicines are given, let the Region of the Liver be anointed with this following Oyntment.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Juyce of Smallage, Parſley, and Succory, of each one ounce: white Wine Vinegar half an ounce: the Oyl of Tamarisk two ounces: boyl them til the Juyces and Vinegar be conſumed; then add of yellow Sanders and Spicknard, of each one dram: Wax, as much as will make a Liniment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After the Obſtructions are taken away, the yellow colour will preſently vaniſh by the ſtrength of Natural Heat, which will diſcuſſe the Humor from the Skin. But that it may ſooner be gone, make a Bath of warm VVater, and rub the Body therein with a Bag of Earley and Bean Meal.</p>

                        <hi>Chap. 5.</hi> Of the Scirrhus of the Liver.</head>
                     <p>THe Scirrhus of the Liver, is a hard Tumor without pain, bred of a thick Humor, faſtened and hardened upon the Liver.</p>
                     <p>This Scirrhus is Two-fold; either it is Exquiſite, or Perfect; or Imperfect. That which is a perfect Scirrhus, is laid down in the Definition propounded, which is without Pain or Sence.</p>
                     <p>That which is not exquiſite or perfect, hath ſome kind of pain, and comes from a Matter leſs hardened; in a word, it is a Scirrhus beginning, and not confirmed: but that which is exquiſite is confirmed, ſo that they only differ in Degrees.</p>
                     <p>A Scirrhus breeds in the Liver two waies; either from Defluxion, or Congeſtion of a thick and glutinous Humor upon the part; or from Inflamation, which diſſolveth the thin Humors, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the thick.</p>
                     <p>The Matter of the former, is Flegm or Melancholly, either ſent from other parts, or bred in the ſubſtance of the Liver by an evil Concoction. For the producing of this Humor, evil diet is a main cauſe, if it be of thick, cold, and viſcous, or clammy Nouriſhment; as alſo a Flegmatick or Melanchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Conſtitution, and a Natural ſtraightneſs of the Liver. From whence <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, 13. Meth. That a Scirrhus eaſily breedeth in the Liver, Spleen, and Reins: In the Liver, becauſe the Paſſages are narrow, and it is nouriſhed with thick blood in the Spleen, becauſe it receiveth the thick blood: and laſtly, in the Reins, becauſe they are nouriſhed with thick blood.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes of the latter Scirrhus, which followeth other Humors, is the immoderate uſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſing Medicines, or of Repercuſſives, which by cooling and binding, do thicken the Matter, and keep it from diſſolving. Beſides, the Matter of the Diſeaſe, which is properly cold and thick, and will not be diſſolved; or the weakneſs of the part, which cannot help the breathing forth of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors. And laſtly, a cooling and thickening Diet.</p>
                     <p>The ſigns of a Scirrhus in the Liver are, a hardneſs in the right Hypochondrion, and that more than in an Obſtruction, next a heavineſs in that part, eſpecially when there is violent breathing, no Feaver, nor pain, by which it is diſtinguiſhed from an Inflamation, or there is but little pain, as when the Schirrus is not exquiſite or perfect: There is leſs repoſe upon the left ſide, becauſe the Liver being hard and heavy, doth then lie upon the Stomach, and burden it: the color of the Face is pale, and and greeniſh, becauſe when the Liver is Schirrus, there is no good Blood produced by it: The whoI Body alſo, is fallen away, becauſe there is neither Sanguification, nor diſtribution of Nouriſhment as it ought to be.</p>
                     <p>The Prognoſtick of this Diſeaſe is given by <hi>Galen, 2. ad Glaucum, cap.</hi> 4. in theſe words: <hi>An inſenſible Scirrus is incurable, but that which is a little ſenſible is curable, though with much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</hi> Alſo <hi>Galen,</hi> cap. 5. of the ſame Book, ſaith, <hi>We have cured a Schirrus of the Liver often in the beginning of it; but when it hath been of long continuance, neither could I, nor any other that I ever heard of, cure it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>An old inveterate Scirrhus turns to a Dropſie incurable, of which ſome die ſooner than others, if they have a looſneſs of the Belly therewith of long continuance.</p>
                     <p>A Scirrhus which followeth the Jaundice, or cauſeth the ſame, is dangerous. Whence <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> Aph. 42. Sect. 6. ſaith, that if the Liver grow hard in them who have the Jaundice, it is an evil ſign.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of a Scirrhus, is firſt by the taking away of the Antecedent Cauſe, by the Apozem which is preſcribed in the Obſtruction of the Liver. To which you may add other Medicines proper to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Obſtructions.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards you muſt diſcuſs the hard Matter with mollifying and opening things. For this end the Steel Pills above mentioned, are excellent, eſpecially if you add thereto, Bdellium, Ammonia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum, and Sagapenum.</p>
                     <p>But if the hardneſs be very great, you muſt give theſe Pills following, many daies together.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Gum Ammoniacum diſſolved in Vinegar, and ſtrained, and again made thick, two drams: Bdellium, and Storax, of each four ſcruples: mix them. Take one dram every other day.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <hi>Chap. 6.</hi> Of the Dropſie.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>HIppocrates</hi> makes two kinds of Dropſies; namely, An Univerſal, and a Particular. An Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Dropſie, is that which is in the whol Body, or over the whol Belly: a Particular, is that which is only in one part: hence there is the Dropſie of the Head, Breaſt, and Womb; of which, here we ſhall not ſpeak, but only of the Univerſal.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Galen</hi> gives three kinds of this Univerſal Dropſie; namely, Aſcites, Tympanites, and Anaſarca, or Leucophlegmaſia.</p>
                     <p>Aſcites is a ſwelling of the Belly, cauſed of a ſerous Humor; nor doth the Belly only ſwell, but many times the Feet, Legs, Thighs, and Cods. Nay, an Aſcites ſomtimes begins with a ſwelling in the Feet, which aſcends after to the Legs, and ſo to the Thighs and Belly.</p>
                     <p>This ſerous Humor, as it is of the Nature of Water, it is cold; but as it is ſalt, it hath in it heat, which then is encreaſed by the neerneſs of the Bowels, and more by the putrefaction which it gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by long continuance: hence comes a Feaver and Thirſt, namely, from the ſtinking ſalt vapors which do infect the mouth of the Stomach.</p>
                     <p>It falls out ſomtimes, that this Watery Humor, is not contained in the Cavity of the Belly, but in certain Bladders growing to the parts of the lower Belly.</p>
                     <p>An Example whereof is given by <hi>Schenkius,</hi> Lib. 3. Obſervation; and <hi>Mauritius Cordaeus,</hi> Com. 5. in <hi>Hipp.</hi> Lib. 1. of Diſeaſes in Women. <hi>Galen</hi> ſuppoſed (and almoſt all Phyſitians, new and old, have followed him) that every Dropſie comes of a cold Liver, which cannot Sanguiſie or make Blood compleatly, but inſtead thereof much Water, Flegm, or Wind. Which Opinion, as it is moſt true in Anaſarca, and approved; ſo in Aſcites and Tympanites it is much queſtioned by many
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:49088:162"/>
Modern Writers, becauſe in the opening of many that died of Dropſies, the Liver hath been ſound very ſound, as is maniſeſt by many relations in thoſe Authors mentioned. Moreover, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> 2. Prorrhet. wittily affirms that a Dropſie may come either from the Liver, or from ſome empty part: by an empty part, he meaneth all that ſpace from the Ribs to the Guts, and the parts contemed in it. Alſo <hi>Hipp. 4. de morb. Mulierum,</hi> mentions a Dropſie coming from the Spleen. To which places of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> they uſually anſwer thus, That the Liver is alwaies affected either primarily or ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darily; ſo that there is never a Dropſie before there is a hinderance of Sanguification, or breeding of Blood. But two Reaſons do ſtrongly oppoſe this Doctrine: The firſt is from the Experience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, namely, That if the Liver ought neceſſarily to ſuffer in the producing of a Dropſie, it would never be found free and unknit in the Diſſection of a dead Body. The ſecond is, That if the Liver ſhould breed watery Blood, it would be ſent into the whol Body, as in Anaſarca; nor can a ſufficient reaſon be given, why that ſerous Humor bred in the Liver ſhould be ſent to the Belly, and not to other parts.</p>
                     <p>As for the cold diſtemper of the Liver, that is denied by <hi>Trallianus, Avicenna,</hi> and others, who affirm that a Dropſie may ariſe from a hot diſtemper of the Liver, and cannot be cured but by cooling means. And this may be maintained by the Authority of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> in 2. Progn. <hi>A Dropſie</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>coming after an acute diſeaſe, is evil, for it doth not take away the Feaver.</hi> If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Dropſie may come while the Feaver is, it is cleer that there is ſtill a hot diſtemper. Neither could that ever pleaſe me, which is uſually ſpoken by <hi>Galens</hi> Servants, That the Native heat is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved by a hot diſtemper, and much diminiſhed, and that diminiſhed heat may be called cold. For ſo in a Hectick Feaver, and other conſtant Feavers, in which the Natural Heat is much diminiſhed, we ſhould alwaies blame a cold diſtemper, and the Symptomes which follow ſhould be impured to cold, and not to heat. From whence, who doth not perceive that there would ariſe a great conſuſion in the ſearching into the Cauſes of Symptomes.</p>
                     <p>Among the late Writers, <hi>Carotus Piſo,</hi> whom <hi>Sennertus</hi> followed, hath dived moſt deep into the true Cauſes of Aſcites, which he affirms to come from a ſerous Matter contained in the Meat and Drink, which by reaſon of ſome preternatural Cauſe, is ſtayed too long in the Gate and Hollow Veins, not ſent into the Body, as in a Natural ſtate and condition it uſeth to be, but into the capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Abdomen. This ſerous Humor is retained in the Veins, from the whol Body, by reaſon the attractive faculty of the Parts, to which it ſhould be carried, is either hurt or hindered.</p>
                     <p>Now the chief parts which draw the ſerous Matter, are the Liver and the Spleen. For they attract the Chylous Matter in which the moiſture of Meat and Drink is contained. As alſo the Spleen draws Drink to its ſelf, pure and without mixture; as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> taught, and Experience confirms, That they who drink much after Meat, do preſently avoid it by Urine; which learned Authors ſay, is by reaſon the Spleen ſucks the watery Matter before there is a perfect Concoction made in the Stomach.</p>
                     <p>The Attraction or drawing quality of the Liver and Spleen, is loſt chiefly by defect and weakneſs of Natural Heat: the Natural heat is debilitated by a cold or hot diſtemper, or by Suffocation.</p>
                     <p>A cold diſtemper coming either from too cold a Diet, from loſs of too much Blood and Spirits, or any other Cauſe, doth deſtroy the Natural Heat of the Liver and Spleen, and ſo hinder their Actions.</p>
                     <p>A hot Diſtemper doth diſperſe the Native Heat; whence being made weaker, the Liver and the Spleen become leſs Active. This comes from Feavers, much Wine, or hot Meats.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, The Natural Heat is weakned by Suffocation, when there is too much Blood in the Veins, eſpecially if it be foul, as when the Terms of Hemorrhoids are ſtopt, by which the blood was clenſed formerly, but now by ſtoppage corrupted.</p>
                     <p>Alſo the Attraction or drawing vertue of thoſe parts, is hindered by Obſtructions, which hinder the free paſſage of the ſerous Matter. So a Dropſie followeth a Scirrhus of the Liver and Spleen, not only becauſe thoſe parts being weakened cannot produce good Blood, but eſpecially becauſe they are not able to attract, and ſend to other parts whatſoever is drunk.</p>
                     <p>Here it may be objected, That in a Dropſie the whol Body is nouriſhed by Blood bred in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of a Chylous Matter, which it draweth to it ſelf. We anſwer, That the Liver doth better at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract that which is moſt familiar unto its ſelf, and moſt ſit to be made blood; but it draweth to it leſs than is ſufficient, by reaſon of the weakneſs of the attractive faculty. Hence it is that the Body grows lean, becauſe it draws ſome water along with the Chylus, and leaves the reſt in the Meſeraick Veins, and the Veins of the lower Belly, which is by degrees carried into the Capacity of the Abdomen.</p>
                     <p>We do not deny that Sanguiſication or making of Blood, is hindered in a Dropſie, eſpecially when the diſtemper is very cold or very hot, or the Obſtruction or Scirrhus great, for then there cannot be a perfect making of blood. But we deny that that is the next and immediate Cauſe of a Dropſie; but rather an effect thereof, when the Water corrupted in the Abdomen, doth alſo corrupt the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels that ſwim therein.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="338" facs="tcp:49088:163"/>Next to the Liver and the Spleen, the Reins do attract the watery Matter which is in the hollow Vein, and free the whol body from the ſuperfluity thereof, ſo that if at any time they do not their office, there remains much matter in the veins, which being ſent to the Abdomen do quickly make an Aſcites; now the attraction of the Veins may ceaſe for divers Cauſes, becauſe of a Cold Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Tumors, Ulcers, and Obſtructions, which wil Diminiſh, Aboliſh, and intercept their Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, The diſtribution of Water is hindered from ſome external Cauſe, as when much cold Water is drunk, which Nature cannot govern, nor ſufficiently diſtribute into the Veins: So <hi>Carolus Piſo</hi> reports of a yong man that had a Tertian Ague, and drinking Water exceedingly in his Fit fel into an Aſcites, from which by the taking of one Lozenge of Diacarthamum he was Cured by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging the Water which was in the Abdomen, but if he had continued drinking ſo much water any louger, he had not been ſo eaſily Cured, becauſe it would have brought great obſtructions and a cold diſtemper of the Bowels, by reaſon of the loſs of natural heat.</p>
                     <p>But it is queſtioned of many by what wayes that ſerous matter ſhould be carried by the Veins into the Capacity of the Abdomen, to whom we may plainly anſwer, by ſaying from <hi>Hippocrates</hi> that in a living body al things are paſſing to and fro, ſo that in time of neceſſity not only thin and ſerous Matter, but alſo that which is very thick may be ſent through the inſenſible paſſages: So in a Pleuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie blood and matter wil pierce through the thick ſubſtance of the Pleura and Membrane which covers the Lungs, and be ſpit forth at the mouth: So in a Fracture of the Leg or Thigh, which hapens with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hurt to the Muſcles and Skin, the matter which floweth from the broken bone, pierceth through the ſubſtance of the other parts and wets the boulſters and rowlers.</p>
                     <p>So alſo in a Dropſie often times a great quantity of Water is vented in one day by giving of Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver, which cannot be except the Water conteined in the Abdomen do paſs through the Tunicles of the Guts.</p>
                     <p>Nor is the Objection of <hi>Fernelius</hi> of any force, when he ſaith that Nature had in vain made ſo many open wayes, if the Humors can paſs through thoſe inviſible paſſages: For we Anſwer, That in an ordinary and natural motion of Humors ordained for the nouriſhment of the whol body, thoſe paſſages are neceſſary through which they may eaſily flow, but in an extraordinary caſe, provident Nature doth find out extraordinary wayes by which ſhe may caſt out hurtful Matter, or at leaſt ſend it to a place leſs dangerous.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fernelius</hi> Objects again, That in them who have died by a ſtoppage of Urine for twenty dayes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, it was never perceived that any Water went through thoſe blind paſſages: We Anſwer, That Nature doth not alwayes work the ſame way in preternatural Cauſes, nor ſend hurtful Humors to the ſame places, but eſpecially to thoſe parts which are more diſpoſed to receive them through weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                     <p>So in the Suppreſſion or Stoppage of Urine, the Serous Humor flowes openly through the Veins and Arteries and fils them, and if it find any part weaker than the reſt it falls forceably upon it: hence it is that ſome die of the hurt of one or other remarkable part. So nothing hinders (if the parts of the Abdomen in which the Veins and Arteries end) be grown weak, but that the Watery Humor may be ſent into its capacity or hollowneſs.</p>
                     <p>Nor is that true which <hi>Fernelius</hi> would infer, namely, That a Dropſie never comes from ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Urine, for Reaſon and Experience teacheth the contrary: as we ſhewed afore in the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the Loſs of Attraction in the Reins: but you muſt obſerve that the Stoppage of the Urine doth make an increaſe of Water rather in the branches of the hollow Vein, then of the Gate Vein or <hi>Vena Porta,</hi> by which the watery Humor chiefly flows into the capacity of the Abdomen as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by what followeth.</p>
                     <p>Therfore we may Anſwer this Queſtion, by ſaying, That the water got into the hollow of the Abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, by the inſenſible paſſages though there are alſo other manifeſt wayes by which it may paſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> Aph. 55. Sect. 7. hath ſhewed them, for (ſaith he) they who have much Water a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Liver, if it get into the Omentum, or Kels, their belly will be filled with Water, and then they die. The meaning of which Aphoriſm is (though <hi>Galen</hi> did not plainly ſee it) that the Water from the Liver doth flow into the Branches of the <hi>Vena Porta</hi> which go to the Omentum, and when they are filled, either by their Tunicles made thin by Diapedeſis or Rarefaction, or by the mouths of the Veſſels being opened by Anaſtomoſis, the Water gets into the Cavity of the Abdomen: This happens often in the Spleen alſo, when it draws Water in abundance from the Stomach, as appears by many ſayings of <hi>Hippocrates;</hi> and in <hi>lib. 4. de morbis,</hi> he ſaith, That Water may preſs from the Spleen to the Omentum or Kell, in theſe words, <hi>Drink is alſo carried into the Stomach with which when it is filled the Spleen takes it from thence and ſends it to the Veins and the Omentum.</hi> From which we may perceive, That Water chiefly gets into the Abdomen, by the Veins of the Omentum which are called Epiploicae, and Gaſtrepiploicae, although it may paſs alſo through their Veins.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="339" facs="tcp:49088:163"/>Beſides the aforeſaid Cauſes of a Dropſie, which are more ordinary, there are mentioned by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors ſome leſs uſual, confirmed by Obſervation: and theſe come from the diſorder of ſome peculiar part, not only of the Liver and Spleen, but alſo of the Meſentery, Sweet-bread Stomach, Guts, Reins, Bladder, and Womb, namely, when the <hi>Homioſis,</hi> or faculty to convert nouriſhment into themſelves is hurt, from ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>me great Diſeaſe, ſo that their proper nouriſhment is corrupted and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into Water. So <hi>Galen,</hi> Comment. Aph. 55. Sect. 7. ſaith, that watery Bladders are ſomtimes in the out-ſide of the Liver, which being broken, ſend Water downwards into the Cavity of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen, the encreaſe whereof breeds a Dropſie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fernelius</hi> ſuppoſeth that the Liver being very dry, hath clefts like the parched Earth, and that through them there flows a conſtant Water which fills the Cavity of the Abdomen. Others ſay that a Dropſie may come from the Guts, if they be perforated or pierced through, and yet the Patient dieth not preſently but a watery Humor ſtill flows through them into the Cavity. It comes alſo from the Kidneys, if they be much Ulcerated, and water flow from them. So <hi>Platerus</hi> reports of one that in a Dropſie had many Ulcers in both Kidneys, from whence both matter and water flowed into the Cavity. There is alſo a Story in <hi>Sennertus,</hi> taken out of <hi>John Heinzius,</hi> of a certain Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who had a Dropſie from the diſtemper of the Womb, whoſe Bowels were all ſound, except the Teſticles or Stones, which were found to be ſwollen as big as the Head of a new-born Child, being blew, hollow, and full of Ulcers, from which there came a ſerous Matter which cauſed the Dropſie.</p>
                     <p>The Dropſie called Tympanites, hath its name from <hi>Tympanum,</hi> a Drum, becauſe the Abdomen is ſtretched out like a Drum, and if you ſtrike it with your hand, it ſounds like it. This ſtretching comes from wind ſhut up in the Cavity of the Abdomen. But ſomtimes this wind is in the Cavity of the Guts; which <hi>Platerus</hi> obſerved, ſaying in ſome that have been thought to die of a Tympany, after they were opened, have had no wind coming forth of the Cavity of the Belly; neither did their Bellies, but their Guts ſink, eſpecially the thin Guts, which were ſo ſtretched with wind that they came forth ſo rouled together that they could not be again thruſt into the Belly.</p>
                     <p>But we muſt obſerve that the wind which cauſeth a Tympany, is ſeldom contained in the Belly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but for the moſt part mixed with Water; as in an Aſcites, not only Water, but Wind alſo is contained; and both theſe Dropſies have their name of that which predominateth: if there be more wind than water it is a Tympany; but if more water than wind, an Aſcites: but if they be equal, it is between both; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o that we may doubt whether that Dropſie be a Tympany, or an Aſcites.</p>
                     <p>The Material Cauſe of Wind, is a crude Humor and thick, whether it be Flegm or Melancholly, which being ſtirred and made thin by heat, ſends forth thick vapors, which are hard to be diſſolved, and theſe are called <hi>Flatus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Crude and thick Humor, is partly in the Stomach and Guts, but eſpecially between the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes of the Midriff and Guts, from whence it is more hard to be moved than from the Cavity of the parts aforeſaid. The 11. Aph. Sect. 6. of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> makes this very probable; <hi>They who have pains and gripings about the Navel and Loyns, which cannot be removed, have a dry Dropſie.</hi> For becauſe the Meſentery is joyned to the Guts by the fore part, and to the Loyns by the hinder part, we may eaſily perceive that the pains which reach from the Navil to the Loyns, come from the Meſentery. Beſides, The greatneſs of the pain, ſhews that the Cauſe is deep in the ſubſtance of the part, and cannot be removed: For if it were in the Cavity of the Stomach and Guts, it would eaſily be remedied.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Efficient Cauſe, Authors differ; ſome ſay from a cold, ſome from a hot diſtemper. They which accuſe a cold diſtemper, think they have <hi>Galen</hi> on their ſide, who ſaies that wind is bred of a weak heat. To whom we anſwer, That heat may be ſaid to be weak in reſpect of the Matter which cannot be diſcuſſed or diſſolved thereby. But this is to be imputed to the Matter, which is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther defective than the Heat, which is commonly too great and Preternatural. And we muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg with the Learned, That a burnt Melanchollick Humor is moſt fit to breed a Tympany, which proceedeth from the parching heat of the Bowels; which heat doth ſtir that Matter, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth from it thick vapors that are hard to be diſſolved.</p>
                     <p>The Dropſie called <hi>Anaſarca,</hi> comes of a Flegmatick Humor ſpread through the whol Body, and therefore the Body is ſwoln and white; from whence the Diſeaſe is called <hi>Leucophlegmatia.</hi> This Flegm comes from a cold Liver, which inſtead of good Blood, produceth crude and flegmatick; which when it cannot be turned into the ſubſtance of the parts, leaveth the crude part that is unfit for Nouriſhment upon them, and makes them ſwell; hence comes Anaſarca, or <hi>Leucophlegmatia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Diſeaſe beginning, is called <hi>Cachexia,</hi> or an evil Habit, and turns into <hi>Leucophlegmatia,</hi> from which it differs but in degree.</p>

                        </gap>nt Cauſes are, all things that cool the Liver too much, and hinder its Concoction, as too much cold and moiſt Diet, the ſtopping of the Terms or Hemorrhoids, Obſtructions, cold Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors,

                     <p>The Signs of a Dropſie, and every ſort of it, may be known by what hath been ſaid.</p>
                     <p>In an Aſcites, you may know that there is water in the Abdomen by its greatneſs, loſt Swelling, and broad, and if you preſs the ſides, you ſhall eaſily hear a noiſe of Water, and when the Patient turns from one ſide to the other, and then the whol Belly lieth as it were on that ſide: then the Feet and Cods ſwell, but the higher part grow leſs; the Urine is little and thick, ſomtimes red, becauſe there goes but little water to the Reins and Bladder, and ſtaies long there, by which means it becomes red and thick. In the progreſs or encreaſe of the Diſeaſe, there is difficulty of Breathing, by reaſon of the abundance of water which lieth upon the Diaphragma or Midriff, eſpecially when the Patient lieth down, and therefore he is forced to ſtand or ſit moſt uſually. There is a troubleſom thirſt from the ſaltneſs of the Humor, with which the Stomach ſwimmeth. And laſtly, there is a conſtant lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering Feaver from the corruption of the Water, which at length doth corrupt all the Bowels ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming therein.</p>
                     <p>In a Tympany, the Belly being ſtrook, ſounds like a Drum; the Bulk of the Belly is leſs burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom than in an Aſcites: There were formerly pains about the Navel and Reins, when the Patient lieth with his face upwards, his Belly remains hard and ſtretched forth, nor doth it turn aſide when he tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, In an Anaſarca, not only the Belly, Thighs, and Leggs, but alſo the Hands, Arms, Breaſt, Face, and whol Body ſwel; and whereſoever you thruſt your finger upon it, it will pit, and leave an impreſſion. The color of the Skin is pale and Earthy, the Fleſh ſoft and looſe, the Water thin and white, breathing difficultly, and ſomtimes a lingering Feaver.</p>
                     <p>As to the Prognoſtick: Every Dropſie is dangerous, and hard to be cured, and the more hard by how much the elder, but Anaſarca is leaſt dangerous; but Aſcites and Tympany are ſomtimes one more dangerous than another, according to their Cauſes. So if Aſcites come from a Scirrhus of the Liver, or Ulcer of ſome internal part, it is more dangerous than a Tympany; but if it come of drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king too much Water, or new Obſtructions, it is leſs dangerous.</p>
                     <p>A Dropſie is more eaſily cured in Servants than in Free-men, in Country men than in Noble men; for they will be better conſtrained to abſtain from Drink and the like, and be more patient than they who have liberty.</p>
                     <p>A Dropſie from the hardneſs of the Spleen, is leſs dangerous, than from the hardneſs of the Liver, becauſe the Spleen is not ſo Noble a part.</p>
                     <p>A Dropſie coming upon an acute Diſeaſe, is evil; nor will it abate the Feaver, but cauſe pain and death. <hi>Hipp. 2.</hi> Prognoſt.</p>
                     <p>They whoſe Liver being full of water, diſcharge it into the Omentum or Caul, their Belly is filled with Water, and they die. <hi>Hipp.</hi> Aph. 55. Sect. 7.</p>
                     <p>He who hath Water between the Skin, or an Anaſarca, if that water which is in the Veins flows in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Belly, the diſeaſe is cured. <hi>Hipp.</hi> Aph. 14. Sect. 6. This Aphoriſm ſeems coutrary to the former. But this contrariety is anſwered, by ſaying that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in the former, by Belly, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the Cavity of the Abdomen; but in this, Belly its ſelf; for if the water flow through the Belly, the Diſeaſe is at an end. Which Opinion is more clearly explained by <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> in Coacis, in theſe words: <hi>In the beginning of a Dropſie, if there come a flux of the belly, without want of Concoction, or Crudity, it is prevented.</hi> You muſt mark that it is in the beginning; for if a flux come upon an old Dropſie, it is not ſo ſafe, becauſe commonly there is ſome fault in the Bowels by continuance, as a Scitrhus, or corruption of ſubſtance, which begets new matter, and death alſo. Henee <hi>Hipp.</hi> in Prorrh. ſaith, that they who are to be cured of the Dropſie, muſt be <hi>Euſpiagchnous,</hi> that is, thoſe that have ſound Bowels, free from the great Diſeaſes mentioned. Otherwiſe, if a flux of the Belly happen with a Scirrhus or corruption of the Liver, they die preſently, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſhews 2. ad Glau. cap. 5. And <hi>Avicen</hi> ſaith thus: <hi>Straitneſs of breath, and flux of the belly ſignifie death within three daies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Little Urine in Dropſies, is evil; the leſs, the worſe, becauſe the Drink runs into the Belly, and not into the Reins. Hence <hi>Hipp.</hi> in Coac. ſaith, <hi>Little and thick Urine, and a Dropſie that is Feaveriſh, is deadly: but if the quantity of Urine encreaſe, we may hope well.</hi> Which is elegant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laid down by Celſus: <hi>And then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there is hope of Health, when they void more Urine than they drink: Therefore it is good every day to meaſure the Urine, and the Drink, and the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with a ſtring, eſpecially while Phyſick is given, to ſee whether it grow leſs or not; for if it encreaſe notwithſtanding the Medicines, it is deſperate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Impoſthumes, or ſpots in the Legs or Hydropical men, are deadly. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> confirms this 7. Epid. in the Hiſtory of <hi>Bion</hi> and <hi>Cteſipthon;</hi> the one whereof died preſently after an impoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hume which ran in his left Knee: the other after he had a red and blewiſh gathering in his right Thigh.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="341" facs="tcp:49088:164"/>Men that are cured by Medicines for Dropſies, if they fall again into the ſame, are deſperate, <hi>Hipp.</hi> in Coac. For it ſignifieth that there is ſome incurable fault lurking in the Bowels, which after the water is emptied, reneweth it again.</p>
                     <p>If the Patient have ſound Bowels, and ſtrength, eat his meat, and concoct well, and be not ſick af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; breath freely, have no pain, cough, or thirſt, and his tongue grow not rough, ſo much as in his ſleep; if Medicines preſently purge him; and if without Medicines he be bound, and in a Natural order; and if his Urine change according to his Diet, or if he be not faint. If all theſe things be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, the Patient is recovered; if ſome of them, there is hopes of amendment; if none, he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate.</p>
                     <p>In a dry Dropſie, to piſs by drops is evil. <hi>Hipp. in Coacis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A Tympany in a Melanchollick Body, is deadly, and Remedies are given in vain.</p>
                     <p>If in a Leucophlegmatia, a ſtrong Diarrhoea follow, the Diſeaſe is cured. <hi>Hipp.</hi> Aph. 29. Sect. 7. but this Diarrhoea muſt be at the beginning, or at leaſt before the Diſeaſe be old, or the ſtrength of the Party weakened; but if it happen when the Patient is weak, it is dangerous.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of the Dropſie conſiſts in the Evacuation of the Matter, whether it be in the whol Body, or in the Abdomen or Belly; in taking away the Cauſe that produced that Matter, and in ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Bowels, eſpecially the Liver.</p>
                     <p>The chief and moſt ordinary Cauſes are, great Obſtructions, and Scirrhus or hard Tumors, the Cure of which Diſeaſes is to be taken out of their proper Chapters. But if they will not ſuffice, you muſt uſe theſe following, which are more proper in Dropſies, and vary them according to the variety of Cauſes, and the Bodies ſick.</p>
                     <p>And firſt, you muſt give an ordinary Purge, by an opening Apozeme that expels ſlegm and water, made thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Roots of Eryngus, Madder, Smallage, Parſley, and Elicampane, of each one ounce: Valerian, Aſarabacca, Dwarf-Elder, and Flower deluce Roots, of each half an ounce: the Bark of the Roots of Capars, and inward Bark of an Aſh and Tamarisk, of each ſix drams: the Leavs of Agrimony, Ceterach, Maiden-hair, Germander, St. Johns-wort, Wormwood, and the leſſer Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taury, of each one handful: Sold anella, or wild Mercury half a handful: the ſeeds of Carrots, Parſley, and Fennel, of each half an ounce: ſcraped Liquoris, and Raiſons ſtoned, of each one ounce: clean Senna one ounce and an half: Agarick tied in a clout three drams: the ſeeds of Dwarf-Elder, and Jallap Roots, of each one dram and an half: Ginger and Cloves, of each one dram: Broom, Elder, and Tamarisk flowers, of each one pugil: Boyl them in equal parts of ſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Water, and white Wine added towards the end, to a pint and a quarter. When it is ſtrained, diſſolve therein, Syrup of Succory with Rhubarb, four ounces. Make a cleer Apozeme, aromati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with three drams of Cinnamon, for four morning draughts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After Univerſal Purging, let the Patient take this following Pouder once a week:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Clean Senna, Gummy Turbith, Hermodacts, Dwarf-Elder ſeeds, Jallan, and Mechoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, of each one dram: Cream of Tartar two drams: Cambugia, half a dram: the pouder of Diamber, Diarrhodon Abbatis, and Fennel ſeeds, of each one ſcruple: Sugar candy three drams: Make a Pouder of them all, of which infuſe two drams, or two drams and an half all night in four ounces of white Wine. Let him take the Wine and the Pouder in the morning.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Syrup of <hi>Rhamus ſolutivus,</hi> or Buckthorn, made of the Juyce of its Fruit, called Rhein Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, with Sugar, given one ounce at a time, doth wonderfully purge water. It muſt be taken pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after Dinner.</p>
                     <p>Or give the Magiſtral Syrup made of the Decoction of the Apozeme afore mentioned, the doſe of Purgers being encreaſed; or this following:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Juyce of Damask Roſes two pints: the Juyce of the Roots of Danewort, Flower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deluce, Succory Leaves, and Agrimony, of each half a pint: the ſeeds of Danewort, Mechoacan Roots, and of the beſt Rhubarb, of each two ounces: Spicknard three drams: yellow Sanders two drams: Cryſtal of Tartar one dram and an half: infuſe them a whol night, and after a little boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſtrain them; then put as much white Sugar as is of the Liquor: boyl it into a Syrup; and add to it of the ſalt of Wormwood half an ounce. Let him take two drams with opening Broth once in a week.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or inſtead of this Syrup, or at other times when it is not taken, you may give theſe Pills, which purge the evil Humors, and alſo open Obſtructions.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the beſt Aloes, ſteeped in the Juyce of Wormwood, half an ounce: Gum Ammoniack diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in Vinegar and ſtrained, the beſt Myrrh, and Crocus Martis prepared with Sulphur, of each three drams: Salt of Wormwood and Tamarisk, of each two drams: Diagridium, and Troches of Albandal, of each one dram: Saffron, Ginger, and Salgem, of each one ſcruple: With Oxymel of Squils make a Maſs of Pills, of which give half a dram twice in a week two hours before Dinner.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="342" facs="tcp:49088:165"/>Alſo Purging Wines are much commended for the cure of the Dropſie, of which there are divers Forms. But theſe are beſt:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Roots of Aſarabacca, and Mechoacan, of each two ounces: the French Flower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deluce, and Bark of the Roots of Danewort and Elder, of each one ounce: Elicampane Roots half an ounce: dry Wormwood and Dodder of Time, of each one pugil: clean Senna one ounce: Soldanella or Sea-foal-foot two drams: the Troches of Rhubarb and Agrimony, of each one dram: Mace and Cinnamon, of each half a dram: Scammony four ſcruples: white Wine two pints and an half: Infuſe them three daies in Balneo Mariae; the veſſel being well ſtopped, keep it without ſtraining. Let him take two or three ounces in the morning, twice or thrice in a week.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Among Medicines for drawing forth of Water, the Juyce of French Flowerdeluce is very much commended, if it be drawn forth with white Wine, it may be given to three ounces; it provoketh ſtool and urine very powerfully. But becauſe it is very offenſive to the mouth and ſtomach with its ſharpneſs, it uſeth to be mixed with Manna or Honey. <hi>Maſſaria</hi> gives it thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Juyce of Flowerdeluce newly drawn with white Wine, three ounces; the beſt Manna one ounce and an half. Mix them for a Potion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Platerus</hi> in his Obſervations; <hi>I gave</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to one in a Dropſie, of the Juyce of Flowerde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luce to drink with Honey two ounces, and he often piſſed and purged; and after he had taken it twice or thrice, his Belly ceaſed ſwelling, and his Feet, and he was cured.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Rhubarb is commended of ſome, becauſe it purgeth noxious Humors, and ſtrengtheneth the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. And <hi>Stocherus</hi> ſaith that he cured many with the uſe of Rhubarb given every third or fourth day, one or two drams in an opening Decoction. Alſo in <hi>Scoltzius</hi> his Epiſtles, there is a famous Story of one who was cured of a Dropſie, only by the uſe of Rhubarb, which he took every day in ſuch a quantity as was neceſſary to purge.</p>
                     <p>The Troches of Rhubarb are much commended by all Authors. And <hi>Mathaeus de Gradi</hi> reports that a certain Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> was cured with them alone, taking two drams twice in a week.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Michael Paſchalius</hi> ſaith that he cured a Dropſie with the ſame, making them into Pills, by reaſon of their bitterneſs.</p>
                     <p>The Chymiſts commend the Extract of black Hellebore., <hi>Aquila Coeleftis,</hi> and <hi>Mercurius vitae,</hi> and they mix them with other vulgar Medicines, from whence followeth a plentiful Evacuation of Water. But they had need of ſtrong Bodies who take them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mercurius dulcis</hi> works moſt gently, and <hi>Mercurius Diaphoreticus.</hi> But <hi>Antimonium Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoreticum</hi> cures without manifeſt Evacuation, if it be calcined with Salt-Peter till it be white: but the Diaphoretick or Sweating Medicine made of the Butter of Antimony, cures all kinds of Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies beſt.</p>
                     <p>But you muſt obſerve in the giving of all ſorts of Purges, That they, eſpecially if ſtrong, are not to be given often, as <hi>Galen</hi> teacheth Lib. 9, <hi>Cata Topous,</hi> becauſe they weaken the body, and then there will more water be bred afterwards. Therefore you muſt preſcribe ſtrengtheners and openers oftener than purgers. And Experience teacheth us, That the Evacuation by Urine in this Diſeaſe hath better ſucceſs than that by ſtool.</p>
                     <p>Inſtead of Purgers, you may give Clyſters, which diſcuſs wind, purge water, and take down the belly, made thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Mallows, Mercury, and red Coleworts, of each one handful: Soldanella or wild Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury half a handful: Annis, Caraway, and Dill ſeeds, of each three drams: Chamomel, Meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, French Lavender and Broom flowers, of each one pugil: boyl them to a pint. In the ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning diſſolve of Diacatholicon one ounce: Hiera Picra half an ounce: Oyl of Dill and Lillies, and of common Honey, of each two ounces. Make a Clyſter twice in a week.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>very ſowr Leaven half an ounce: common Salt one pugil: Boyl them in as much Water as is ſufficient: ſtrain it, and add to it, the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine of a Child four ounces: Oyl of Rue three ounces: Clarified Honey one ounce. Make a Clyſter.</hi> This <hi>Valeriola</hi> commends highly.</p>
                     <p>This following Clyſter, brings forth Water in abundance:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Coloquintida one dram, Infuſe it for a night in three ounces of white Wine: when it is ſtrained add thereto, Tripe Broth one pint: common Oyl two ounces: Salt-Peter melted one ounce: ſtrong Vinegar one spoonful: make a Clyſter.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Pulp of Coloquintida one dram: Clean Bran one handful: boyl them in white Wine for a Clyſter.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Carthamus ſeeds one ounce: the beſt Agarick half an ounce: the pulp of Coloquintida three drams: Centaury the leſs, Germander, and both the Wormwoods, of each half a handful: boyl them to a pint. In the ſtraining diſſolve of Oyl of Chamomel, Rue, and Capars, of each one ounce: Honey of Roſes two ounces: make a Clyſter.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Emollient Decoction one pint: thick vomiting Wine, the Infuſion of Crocus metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum four ounces: Diaphoenicon one ounce: make a Clyſter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="343" facs="tcp:49088:165"/>Blood-letting here, is for good Reaſon omitted, except the Diſeaſe come from ſtoppage of the Terms or Hemorrhoids. And then you muſt not bleed except it be in the beginning of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, before the Liver be grown too cold.</p>
                     <p>Iſſues, Bliſters and Scarrifications, uſe to cauſe Gangrenes, or mortifications in a Dropſie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the heat of the part being ſmal, is quickly extinguiſhed: Therefore it is better wholly to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from theſe kind of Remedies, although ſomtimes they have done ſome people good.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Paracenteſis,</hi> or cutting of the Skin, is ſeldom to be uſed, becauſe few are cured thereby, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe the Patients, or their kindered will not yield to it before the Diſeaſe is confirmed, and the Bowels are ſo putrefied that there is no hope. Therefore for the moſt part they die the ſecond or third day after they are cut. The wiſer ſort will have the Inciſion made in the beginning or encreaſe of the Diſeaſe, before the Bowels are corrupted. Neither is it neceſſary at that time, becauſe the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe being ſmal may more ſafely be cured with other Medicines.</p>
                     <p>Among emptying Medicines, Sweatings are accounted moſt profitable, which, as they are alwaies good in Anaſarca, ſo in a Tympany, or Aſcites, they ſomtimes hurt, namely, when drineſs of the Liver (which is uſual) cauſeth the Diſeaſe. Moreover, it is commonly impoſſible to make men in Dropſies ſweat. But if the Liver be not dry, Sweats are good in all kinds of Dropſies, eſpecially when they decline, to diſcuſs the reliques of the watery Humor by the Habit of the Body. So <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riola</hi> reports that he cured an Aſcites with a Decoction of Guajacum given fourty daies together. It is good to make the Decoction with ſteeled Water and Wine. The Chymicks commend Antimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Diaphoreticum.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Martinus Rulandus</hi> makes a Sudorifick of Juniper Berries, which becauſe they are forceable to provoke Urine, may do good both waies. It is thus made:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Juniper berries bruiſed three handfuls: Sack as much as is ſufficient: boyl them to halfs and give two ounces every morning, covering warm after it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Horatius Reſerus</hi> in <hi>Scholtzius,</hi> boaſteth that he hath cured many Boyes, and ſome Women of the Anaſarca with Syrup of St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> which is a Sudorifick: Its deſcription is in an old Diſpenſatory called <hi>Luminare majus,</hi> thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Gromwel ſeeds husked two ounces: spring Water half a pint: boyl them till three or four ounces of water only remain; which being ſtrained, mix it with as much Sack, and give it warm; it will ſweat him plentifully if he be covered warm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But thoſe Medicines are beſt which purge by Urine, and the Cure is commonly better this way.</p>
                     <p>One of the chief, is two ounces of the Juyce of Chervil given every morning in Wine for many daies.</p>
                     <p>Opening Wines that purge by Urine are good in this caſe; as this,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Elicampane, Smallage, Fennel, and Flowerdeluce Roots dried, of each one ounce and an half: Roots of Valerian, Gentian, Aſarabacca, and Squils or Sea Onions, of each one dram: the middle Bark of an Elder, and Saſſaphras, of each ſix drams: dried Wormwood, Agrimony, Germander, and Maiden-hair, of each two drams: the tops of Centaury the leſs, and Broom flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, of each one dram: Parſley, Annis, and Dill ſeeds, of each one dram and an half: Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon two drams: Spicknard half a dram: bruiſe them together, and infuſe them in white Wine ſome few daies, and let him drink thereof every morning.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſteeled compound Wine preſcribed in the Obſtruction of the Liver, is good for the ſame.</p>
                     <p>The Decoction of Juniper mentioned, is to be reckoned among the Diureticks. And if you fear it is too hot, you may make it in Water, and put a little Spirit of Vitriol to it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fonſeca</hi> commends the uſe of Turpentine waſhed with Barley Water, and he gives half an ounce thereof twice in a week.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly, The Spirit of Salt, Tartar, and Vitriol, given in a true quantity with an Apozeme, or other opening Decoction for ſome daies, do wonders: becauſe they being very thin, do run into all the parts of the Body, and open them.</p>
                     <p>The Salts of Wormwood, Juniper, Bean Stalks, and the like, given in white Wine, do the ſame. Or in want of Salts you may make a Lee of the Aſhes of the ſame, which will be ſufficient</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mathiolus</hi> upon the 87. Chap. Lib. 1. of <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> ſaith, <hi>That a Lee made of Juniper Aſhes with white Wine, and four or five ounces thereof taken, doth powerfully provoke <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine, ſo that I have ſeen ſome men cured of a Dropſie with it alone.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Moreover, In the whol time of the Cure, you muſt uſe ſtrengtheners to the Liver; for it is in vain to purge water, if you do not hinder the encreaſe of it: which you cannot do except you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh the Liver, and bring it to its former temper.</p>
                     <p>Among the chief Strengtheners is Cinnamon Water; of which you may give one Spoonful every morning, and before Supper.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="344" facs="tcp:49088:166"/>But <hi>Galen</hi> in his Eight Book <hi>Kata Topous</hi> commends the Electuary called Cyphoides by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabians from the Wine whereof it is made, of which you may give half an ounce in the morning, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Hollerius</hi> it is thus made,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Curans clenſed half a pound: boyl them in old Sack to the conſiſtence of a Pultis, ſtrain them after they are pounded, and then ad of the conſerve of Roſemary flowers, Citron barkcandied, and Cinnamon, of each one dram: the Pouder of Aromaticum Roſatum, Diamargariton cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum, and Diacinamom, of each two ſcruples: Lignum Aloes half a dram<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Saffron half a ſcruple: mix them for a ſoft Electuary.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Opiates preſcribed for the Obſtruction of the Liver are here very profitable.</p>
                     <p>The Conſerve of Sea Wormwood is very good, made of one part of the Leaves and three of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar with which <hi>Matthiolus</hi> in his Chapter of Wormwood ſaith ſome have been Cured.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Poterius</hi> makes an Opiate of Conſerve of Roſes, Specificum, Somachium, and Crocus Martis, and Oyl of Vitriol, by which only Medicine he ſaith he hath Cured Dropſies. The Specificum Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machium, is Antimony fixed.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of men in Dropſies lieth much in their drink: therefore there muſt be care of that, that he drink ſparingly, and endure thirſt as much as may be: for it is known that many have been Cured only with abſtaining from drink and eating of dry meats without other means: For Drink let him take Elicampane or Wormwood, Juniper, or Steeled Wine, or let him uſe the aforeſaid Steel Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines. <hi>Avicen</hi> forbids men in a Dropſie to ſee Waters. But if you fear too much Heat or Dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or if the Patient be Abſtemious, he may uſe the Decoction of Juniper, of Guajacum, or Saſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaphras, or of Madder, which provokes urin very much, either alone, or with white Wine: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he muſt abſtain from Drink (as we ſaid) and yet there is great Thirſt, it muſt be aſſwaged by Fits with waſhing the mouth with ſteeled Water and Vinegar, or with often chewing Maſtich or the like; for it wil draw water to the mouth, not only (as ſome think) out of the head alone, but from the Stomach and Cavity of the Abdomen, and therefore it will do much good.</p>

                     <p>Although the things aforeſaid are chiefly uſed, yet ſomtimes they are not neceſſary, namely, when the Dropſie comes in a hot and dry Conſtitution from hot cauſes which diſperſe the natural heat, as in vehement Chollerick Feavers, for then cold things for the Liver mixed with warm Openers are beſt, ſuch as are uſed in continual Feavers: And the Magiſtral Syrup above mentioned made of the Juyce of Roſes, Succory, and Agrimony.</p>
                     <p>For ordinary Drink give a Decoction of Succory Roots and Calcitrapa, or white Chamelion, which is not unpleaſant; or of other Openers, but in a greater quantity than above, which may quench thirſt, aſſwage the heat of the Liver, and moiſten the drineſs thereof: It is not amiſs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this Doctrine by a famous example (though it be allowed by <hi>Avicen, Trallian,</hi> and others) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſeems ſtrange to ſome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and is of great Conſequence: <hi>Baptiſta Montanus</hi> reports, <hi>Conſ.</hi> 263. in theſe words; <hi>I ſaw</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in Venice a certain Predicant Frier that was cured of an Aſcites and Tympanites: there were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with me many famous Phyſitians; namely,</hi> Papienſis, Eugubinus, Trincavella, <hi>and others: He had (as I ſaid) an Aſcites with a Tympany, and a Conſumption with a Hectick Feaver; therefore we were bound both to dry and moiſten: therefore we were in a great contention; I was willing that he ſhould drink much, but things that Open, becauſe he had many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p>THe Inflamation of the Spleen is of the ſame Nature with that of the Liver: only it differs in this; That it ſeldom comes from pure, but from Melanchollick Blood.

                     <p>Theſe ſigns are greater or leſſer, according to the divers mixtures of Humors. For if Choller be mixed with Melanchollick Blood, the Urine is more red, the Mouth bitter, the Thirſt greater, the Feaver ſtronger and worſe every third day; great watchings, and ſomtimes do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

with Flegm, the Color is pale, the Feaver and Thirſt is leſs, and the pain leſs: But if the Blood be only Melanchollick, the hardneſs is greater, the color is black, and ſomtimes the Urine, and there is other ſigns of Melancholly predominating.</p>
                     <p>The Prognoſtick is almoſt the ſame with that of the Liver inflamed, but leſs dangerous, becauſe the Liver is the nobler Part. If it kill not the party, either it ends in a Criſis, or it is diſſolved or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purated, or grows hard and turns into a Scirrhus. A good Criſis is when the left Noſtril bleeds, or when there is a purging by Stool or Urine.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of this Diſeaſe, is the ſame with that of the Liver: only obſerve theſe Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, You muſt open the left Arm in this, and not ſo often as in the Inflamation of the Liver, becauſe the Liver being the Fountain of blood, wants greater Evacuation. That which is reported of the Salvatella Vein to diſcharge the Spleen ſo properly, is but a conceit, and is now out of uſe: you may better take blood out of the Liver Vein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> called Baſtica.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, You muſt apply thoſe Topicks, or outward Medicines now to the left ſide.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, You muſt not take ſuch care in the uſe of binding Medicines outwardly, becauſe the Spleen is not ſo noble a part, and needs leſs ſtrengthening.</p>
                     <p>Other things are to be taken out of the Cure of the Inflamation of the Liver.</p>

                     <p>SOmtimes the Spleen is pained without Feaver or hardneſs; and this comes from wind which doth not only ſtretch the ſubſtance of the Spleen, which is almoſt inſenſible, but the Membranes that covereth it.</p>
                     <p>It is eaſily diſtinguiſhed from the Inflamation by the Feaver, and hardneſs being abſent, but hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Chollick, becauſe the Colon is juſt under and over the Spleen: yet the pain of the Spleen is weighty, and in one place; but the pain of the Colon is ſtretching, ſharp, and movable, and runs about the whol Belly.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of this Diſeaſe, is with Clyſters that are Carminative, or that expel wind with conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient purging, and with Emollient and Diſcuſſing Fomentations mixed with Vinegar: As alſo with Liniments made of Oyl of Lillies, Chamomel, Capars, and Wormwood, with a little Spike and Vinegar.</p>
                     <p>If the pain remain after the uſe of theſe, apply a Cupping-glaſs to the left Hypochondrion, if there be no ſuſpition of the Inflamation or Defluxion.</p>

                        <hi>Chap. 3.</hi> Of Obſtruction, Tumor, or Puffing up of the Spleen.</head>
                     <p>THe Spleen is no leſs ſubject to Obſtructions than the Liver, but more, becauſe it receiveth thicker and fouler blood, which is more eaſily contained in its Veins, or inſenſible Paſſages, by reaſon of the ſoftneſs and looſneſs of the part, which is more fit to receive thick Humors. And when thick Humors ſtick in the ſubſtance of the Spleen, it makes a Tumor, and an Inflamation in the part. And if the Humor by long continuance grow thick and hard, it breeds a Scirrhus; but as long as it is moiſt with Flegm, it is like an Oedema or flegmatick Tumor, which is moſt uſual with them who live in Marſhy moiſt places, or who live upon cold Diet. But if this Tumor be ſoft and looſe, it is called ſimply an Inflamation, or puffing up, the cauſe whereof, is partly flegm, and partly wind. They are commonly called Splenitick people who are thus afflicted.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes of the Obſtruction of the Spleen, are the ſame with them of the Liver, and this or that part is, as it is more or leſs diſpoſed to receive them: Somtimes both Liver and Spleen are affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted together; for a groſs Humor can hardly be in one part, but ſome of it muſt be carried to the other.</p>
                     <p>The Obſtruction of the Spleen is diſtinguiſhed from the Obſtruction of the Liver, from the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of the part; for there is a heavineſs in the left Hypochondrion, and ſomtimes pain, eſpecially after running o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="349" facs="tcp:49088:168"/>This Diſeaſe is ſtubborn and of long continuance, by reaſon of the ſoftneſs and looſneſs of the part, which cannot therefore eaſily diſcharge the humor; and if it laſt long and be not Cured ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, it turns into a Scirrhus.</p>
                     <p>The Cure is the ſame with that of the Obſtruction of the Liver, by adding ſome things which do more properly reſpect the Spleen, and are fitter to prepare and purge Melancholly.</p>
                     <p>The Pills of Ammoniacum which follow, are to be added as moſt excellent, and to be uſed often,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the beſt Ammoniacum diſſolved in Vinegar of Squills one ounce: the extract of Aloes half an ounce: Cryſtal of Tartar one dram: Myrrh and Saffron, of each half a dram: Maſtich, Benjamine, Salt of Aſh, and Wormwood, of each one ſcruple: with Oxymel of Squills make a maſs of Pills. The Doſe is half a dram twice in a Week, with Purging between.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In Apozemes and other Opening Drinks, Oxymel ſimple, and of Squills, or Sea Onyons may be very wel diſſolved, to cut and diſſolve powerfully the groſs and earthy humors.</p>
                     <p>Of all other Medicines thoſe which are made of Steel are the beſt to open the Obſtructions of the Spleen.</p>
                     <p>Alſo you may give Steeled or Ironed Waters for ordinary Drink, which are known to leſſen the Spleen (as <hi>Celſus</hi> ſaith) by this, becauſe Beaſts that are brought up at Smiths houſes have little Spleens.</p>
                     <p>To the Fomentation put Vinegar inſtead of white Wine, which wil make them peirce better, which is requiſite in a groſs humor.</p>
                     <p>Moreover <hi>Galen</hi> Commends Vinegar exceedingly in the Diſeaſes of the Spleen, uſed both inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and outwardly.</p>

                     <p>There is an Excellent Cataplaſm made of Green Tobacco; boyled in Oyl, and White Wine.</p>

                     <p>THe matter of the Spleen cauſing obſtruction by continuance grows thicker, and makes a Scirrhus: And ſince the Scirrhus of the Liver and Spleen are both of one Nature, whatſoever we have ſaid of the Scirrhus of the Liver, may be here alſo uſeful.</p>
                     <p>The Knowledg alſo of the Scirrhus of the Spleen is the ſame with that of the Liver, but only the hardneſs is on the contrary ſide.</p>
                     <p>It is Diſtinguiſhed from a Windy Tumor; becauſe there is more Heavineſs in a Schirrhus, than in a Windy Tumor, which yeildeth to the Finger, and maketh a Noiſe; al which are not in a Scirrhus.</p>
                     <p>If it come only of Melancholly, there wil be evident ſigns thereof; but if it be mixed with Flegm, there is apparent in the whol body a Phlegmatick evil habit.</p>
                     <p>The Prognoſtick alſo is the ſame with that of the Liver; only this of the Spleen is more eaſily Cured; becauſe the leſs Noble the part is, the ſtronger Medicines may be Applied without Danger.</p>
                     <p>And Laſtly, The Cure is the ſame with that mentioned in the Scirrhus of the Liver.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe it is to be done by degrees, from mild to ſtronger Medicines: firſt you muſt uſe thoſe Remedies which we ſaid were good for the Obſtructions of the Liver and Spleen: and among the Chalybeat Medicines there commended, the Principle is the Pills of Steel, made with Amoniacum, and other things mentioned in the Obſtruction of the Liver.</p>
                     <p>Pills of Aloes, Ammoniacum, and Mercurius dulcis, are the beſt among the Medicines for the Scirrhus of the Liver.</p>
                     <p>But this following Opiate is the Medicine wil Cure, if it be not incurable:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Gum Ammoniack, Opopanax, and Bdelium, of each two drams: diſſolve them in white Wine: ſtrain and boyl them, then ad of confectio Hamech, and Diaphaenicon, of each two

drams: double Catholicon half an ounce: Pilulae foetidae two drams: make an Opiate, of which let him take half an ounce with twenty grains of Mercurius dulcis for many daies together, and ſo the Tumor and hardneſs will vaniſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And beſides what was ſaid concerning the Liver, you muſt obſerve theſe following Precepts in in this Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Becauſe Blood-letting is much queſtioned, we reſolve that it may be good in the beginning. But it is good for nothing when the Diſeaſe is old.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The dead or blind Nettle called <hi>Galiopſis,</hi> or <hi>Pliny</hi>'s Arch-angel, is commended by <hi>Solenander</hi> and <hi>Fonſeca,</hi> for a ſpecial Remedy; the Italians call it the Spleen Herb: this is given boyled in Wine, the quantity of an ounce, or one dram in Pouder, with Wine or other convenient Liquor or Decoction, with moſt admirable ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Beſides the Fomentations there mentioned, <hi>Aquapendens</hi> in his Chyrurgery, commends the fomentation of the Belly, with a Spunge dipped in Time Water, and ſqueezed; and with that he ſaith he hath cured the Scirrhus of the Spleen and Dropſie.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Beſides the Oyntments afore mentioned, <hi>Amatus Luſitanus</hi> commends this following as admirable, by which he ſaith he cured a Scirrhus of the Spleen; and he ſaith that he had it from the Phyſitians of <hi>Ferraria.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Common Oyl three pints: the Marrow of an Ox bone one pound: freſh Butter half a pound: the Juyces of Briony and Sowbread, of each one pint: boyl them gently till the Juyces are almoſt conſumed. Add to the ſtraining, yellow Wax eight ounces: the Pouder of Ceterach or Spleenwort, Capar barks, Tamarisk, and Agnus Caſtus ſeeds, of each three drams. Mix them into an Oyntment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus it is deſcribed by <hi>Amatus;</hi> but there is too much for one Patient, therefore you may leſſen it thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Common Oyl three ounces: Ox Marrow one ounce: freſh Butter half an ounce: the juyce of the Root of Briony and wild Cucumers, of each one ounce and an half: boyl them as afore, and add one ounce of Wax, and of the pouder of Ceterach: Capar and Tamarisk Barks, and Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Caſtus ſeeds, of each two drams.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, The Cataplaſms following are excellent:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Roots of wild Cucumers one pound: Mallows and Violets, of each three handfuls: boyl them till they are ſoft, beat them and ſtrain them: then add of the Oyl of Capars and Tama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risk, Vinegar of Squills a little: make a Cataplaſm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>ſowr Leaven two pound: Boyl it in equal parts of Oyl and Wine to a Pultiſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beſides the Plaiſters mentioned in the Scirrhus of the Liver, theſe are very good:</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Hemlock four handfuls: Ammoniacum half a pound: Infuſe them in Vinegar eight daies: then boyl them til the Ammoniacum be diſſolved: then ſtrain them through a linnen cloth, and boyl the Liquor again a little while, and with Wax and Oyl of Almonds, make a Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Juyce of Mallows, Creſſonis, the Stalks and Roots of Fern, of each two ounces: Gum Ammoniack four ounces: With a little Vinegar, firſt diſſolve them with a gentle fire, then boyl them, and ſtrain them: then boyl them again to the conſiſtence of a Syrup, and with one ounce of Oyl of Capars, and a little Wax, make a Sparadrap for the Spleen, to be renewed every third day.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aquapendens</hi> in the place cited, ſaith, that he cured many with this Plaiſter, which is made of two parts of Ammoniacum diſſolved in Vinegar, and one of the Juyce of Tobacco; one of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zin of the Pine-tree, Turpentine, and Juyce of Danewort; one of Oyl of Capars, and a little new Wax in the Form of a Cerat.</p>

                     <p>ALthough all the parts beneath the Ribs, called Hypochondria, are affected in this Diſeaſe, yet its thought the Spleen is moſt, becauſe it receives the Melancholly, and therefore it is fitly placed among the Diſeaſes of the Spleen.</p>
                     <p>This Diſeaſe comes of Preternatural Melancholly, and other aduſt Humors, eſpecially Blood, or Choller, or Natural Melancholly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="351" facs="tcp:49088:169"/>This Melanchollick Humor is not pure by its ſelf, but commonly mixed with others, as Choller, Flegm, and Water, from whence come the diverſity of Symptomes, which hereafter ſhal be mentioned. Theſe Humors breed in the Spleen, eſpecially when it is diſtempered with heat, and alſo in the Liver: hence it is that they draw meat and drink to themſelves, which is not concocted, that which is thin of the Chyle ſooner than that which is thick: and then the thicker part for want of ſomthing to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it, ſtaies in the Meſeraick Veins, and the longer it ſtaies, the thicker it grows, and ſomtimes is burnt: and afterwards coming to thoſe parts, it is not well concocted.

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and being too much, as in the ſtoppage of the Terms and Hemorrhoids, which continuing long in the Veſſels is burnt, and turned into Melancholly.</p>
                     <p>It may alſo come from the Stomach not well concocting, but turning it into a parched Crudity, from which thoſe evil Juyces are bred in the Liver, and the Spleen. And <hi>Galen,</hi> 3. de loc. affect. cap. 7. following <hi>Diocles,</hi> thought the proper ſeat of it was in the Stomach, becauſe in this Diſeaſe there are commonly ſigns of an ill Stomach: But it is more probable that the Stomach ſhould be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted ſecondarily from the Liver or the Spleen, as we will cleerly ſhew hereafter.</p>
                     <p>Theſe evil Humors are gathered into the Veins and Arteries, which are in the bottom of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, eſpecially in the great branches of the Gate Vein, the Spleen Veins, and thoſe of the Meſentery, Caul, and Belly, in which they have often great and grievous ferventations or workings; from whence ſtinking Vapors are ſent to the Brain, Heart, and Midriff, which cauſe thoſe divers Symptomes in thoſe parts, which we ſhall after mention.</p>
                     <p>Alſo the Humors are contained in the Bowels, eſpecially in the Spleen and Sweet-bread, and the Glandles of the Meſentery, the ſubſtance of which parts is foft, and like a Spunge, and therefore is more ready to receive them, and harder to caſt them forth. Beſides, the Glandles which are d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through the Meſentery, to be a prop to Veins and Arteries, and to hinder leaſt they ſhould be preſſed by the Guts being full, or by any other thing: If theſe ſwell much, they do preſs upon the Veſſels, and hinder the paſſage of the Humors, whence come Obſtructions in thoſe paſſages.</p>
                     <p>Boyes and yong men are little ſubject to this Diſeaſe, by reaſon of their moiſt temper unfit to breed Melancholly: but men often, becauſe the Humors are burnt by heat in youth; and when that heat decaies, and the thin parts are exhaled, there is a great encreaſe of Melancholly.</p>
                     <p>The Antecedent and principal Cauſes of this Diſeaſe, are firſt Meats of evil Juyce, and hard of Concoction, which are fit to breed Melancholly; as brown Bread, or unleavened, or cruſty, Pulſe, Cheeſe, hard Eggs, and fried Meats, Water Fowl, Beef, Veniſon, Hairs, and all Salt and ſmoaked Meats, and many other things of hard ſubſtance.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Great Paſſions of long continuance, eſpecially Sadneſs, are very powerful to breed this Diſeaſe becauſe they diſperſe the Spirits, by which means the Concoction is weakened, and ſo there is great Crudity, which being burnt by the hot Bowels turn into Melancholly.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Idleneſs, by which the Excrements are retained, eſpecially if there be much ſtudy and watching; hence it is that learned men, and ſuch as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Laſtly, The ſtoppage of the Terms and Hemorrhoids, both in reſpect of their quality and quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty produce it: For when Melanchollick, Salt and burnt Humors, uſed to be diſcharged by thoſe waies, if they are ſtopped they return to the Hypochondria and cauſe this Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>The Knowledg of this is taken from the Symptomes which follow, and they are many, becauſe almoſt all parts of the Body ſuffer thereby when it is high: We ſhall reckon them up, admoniſhing firſt, That all do not happen to all Patients, but ſome to one, ſome to another, according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of the Humor, and the part affected.</p>
                     <p>Firſt therefore, the Stomach commonly ſuffers, not principally, as <hi>Galen</hi> from <hi>Diocles</hi> ſuppoſed; but ſecondarily: When Blood coming from the Branches of the Gate Vein, to nouriſh the Stomach is not good; from whence the Stomach being ill nouriſhed, doth ill concoct, and turns its Meat into corruption. Hence comes a circular Evil, when the Liver and Spleen ſend evil Blood to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and the Stomach breeds evil Chyle to return to them, of which they make bad blood.</p>

                     <p>Somtimes the Matter in the Stomach boyleth, and fermenteth; from whence comes wind, which doth not only ſtretch the Stomach, but the parts adjacent, and make the Heart ſo ſick that ſomtimes

the Patient ſwooneth. Somtimes the Wind is ſent out upwards and downwards, and by inſenſible tranſpirati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>, or the Matter cauſing them is vomited forth.</p>
                     <p>Yet you muſt obſerve that al that is vomited out is not bred in the Stomach, but is ſent from the Spleen and other parts to it: for ſomtimes the humors vomited are ſo ſharp that they ſet the teeth on edg, and theſe are ſent by the ſhort veſſel from the Spleen to the Stomach.</p>
                     <p>In ſome there is blood ſo ſent, with Melancholly and other evil Humors, which is caſt forth part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upward, and partly downward; as we ſhewed at large in the Vomiting of Blood.</p>
                     <p>In this Diſeaſe there is often belching and noiſe beneath the ribs, by reaſon of the abundance of Wind made of thoſe Crude Humors: hence it was wont to be called the windy Diſeaſe. Now, how Wind is bred of Melancholly, we ſhewed in the Tympany.</p>
                     <p>Somtimes pains ariſe in the Stomach and Hypochondria, of the ſame Wind, which reach to the Back and Loyns, ſo that you would think it the Stone of the Kidneyes, eſpecially if the Urine be thick and red, as uſually it is.</p>
                     <p>The Belly is often bound, becauſe the Meat is turned into clammy Matter, which ſticks to the Guts, which the expulſive Faculty cannot caſt out without help of Medicines, and therefore the Patients are conſtrained to take Purges and Clyſters often.</p>
                     <p>Somtimes there is a Flux of the Belly, if the Humors grow ſharp, and have in them much Choller or burnt Melancholly.</p>
                     <p>There is a heat in the Hypochondria, and a certain Inflamation inward, ſomtimes in one ſide, ſomtimes in another, from hot Humors contained therein, eſpecially when they are moved by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or outward means; ſo that the Face will grow hot and red from thoſe vapors; and ſomtimes there is an Ephemeral, or Feaver, for a day, by thoſe vapors ſent through the whol Body.</p>
                     <p>The Urine is ſomtimes thick, ſomtimes thin. Thin, when thick Humors ſtop the paſſages through which it is as it were ſtrained, thick, red, and troubled, by reaſon of the mixture of the thick Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is very ſalt, and therefore is called (<hi>Materia Tartaria</hi>) and it lies at the bottom of the Urinal like a thick Sediment. Or ſome part of it ſticks like red Sand to the ſides, which makes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fear the Stone without cauſe, becauſe this ſame is not bred in the Reins, but in the Liver, from a burnt and ſalt Humor, and you may know this, becauſe it diſſolves between the Fingers like Salt, which will not when it comes from the Reins.</p>
                     <p>Somtimes there is a Palpitation, or beating of the Heart, by reaſon of the vapors aſcending, which while it labors to expel, make it move violently; and then the Patient thinks himſelf in great danger.</p>
                     <p>Somtimes there is a beating in the left Hypochondrion, when hot Humors are there; from whence vapors ariſe, and make the Pulſe or Syſtole and Diaſtole of the Arteries greater; ſo that both the Patient and the ſtanders by may feel it, which is chiefly after heat with Anger, motion, or drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of much Wine. This beating is chiefly in the Coeliack Artery, which is the chiefeſt in that part. In an old Diſeaſe, it is ſomtimes conſtant; and this ſignifies an Habitual and incurable Diſeaſe. An Aneuriſm ſomtimes followeth this great breathing, from the enlarging of the Coeliack, or ſome other Artery, and from the hot blood in them, which being very thin and full of many hot Spirits, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally dilateth and ſtretcheth the Arteries while there is an Aneuriſm, ſuch as <hi>Fallopius</hi> obſerved, <hi>Lib. de tum. preter naturam, cap.</hi> 14. in an old woman, who being opened had an Aneuriſm in her Belly, into which he put his fiſt. From which, mark by the way, the great providence of Nature, which fearing the breaking of an Artery through too much enlarging, hath made the coat of it as hard as a bone, as <hi>Fallopius</hi> obſerved in the ſame place. Alſo <hi>Paraeus</hi> in his ſixth Book, Cap. 28. tels the like ſtory of an Aneuriſm, found not in the Belly, but the Breaſt, in the Venal Artery, which was ſo ſtretched that it could contain his ſiſt; and alſo the inward Tunicle thereof was like a bone. And we have ſeen the like about two yeers agone, namely, an Aneuriſm in the Breaſt by the dilatation of an Artery, which would hold the fiſt of a Boy of fifteen yeers old; and the Tunicle thereof was grown like a Griſtle.</p>
                     <p>The evil vapors that aſcend from the Hypochondria, produce many Symptomes: for being ſent to the Pallat and Tongue they dry thoſe parts, and cauſe a thirſt: when they go to the Lungs and Midriff, they cauſe ſhortneſs of breathing; when to the Membranes of the Brain, Head-ach; when to the Brain, noiſe in the Ears, dimneſs of Sight, Giddineſs, Fear, and Sorrow, and divers Melanchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Phanſies. And if they be malignant, and very ſharp, they cauſe an Epilepſie, or Falling-ſickneſs: if they come to the Nerves, Convulſions: and if they be ſtupifying they cauſe a Numbneſs, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard Palſey, Coma, and Apoplexy, if they get into the Brain. But if theſe vapors be hot and dry, they dry the Brain, and cauſe watchings, troubleſom ſleep, and frightful Dreams: and at firſt, though they ſleep well after Supper til midnight, afterward they wake, ſome three or four hours, and ſome ſleep again about three or four a clock, others not at all. The reaſon whereof is this: Becauſe while the Chyle is carried to the parts that ſerve for the ſecond Concoction, then the evil Humors lying in the Veſſels, are ſtirred, and ſend up vapors, which being ſent by the Veins and Arteries to the Head,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:49088:170"/>
cauſe watching, and if they be quickly diſcuſſed, they ſleep again; but if they continue long, they watch the other part of the night.</p>
                     <p>We have formerly ſpoken of all theſe Symptomes, and we ſay again, That all are not in all men, but more or ſewer, according to the variety of the Humors, and parts affected.</p>
                     <p>This alſo is to be marked; It is not Eſſential to Hypochondriack Melancholly, that ſtretching, hardneſs, pain. and ſwelling, ſhould be in the Hypochondria, becauſe the cauſe is for the moſt part in the Branches of the Gate Vein, and Arteries adjoyning, and ſends from thence vapors to the Heart and Brain. Oftentimes there is ſtretching in the Liver and Spleen, which ſignifieth, That the Humors ſtick in thoſe parts: but if there be no ſtretchings, it is a ſign that the evil Humors lie in the Veins of the Meſentery, Caul, Sweetbread, and Stomach. Theſe proper Symptomes ſhew that the Stomach is affected with ſowr belchings, and ſtinking, or loathing, vomiting, want of concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſomtimes flux of the belly.</p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſtick: This Diſeaſe is not deadly for the moſt part, but of long continuance, many times the whol life, therefore it is commonly called the diſgrace of Phyſitians, becauſe they do ſeldom cure it; and if the Patient ſeem to be cured, it returns again in a few months: it is alſo called the Scourge of Phyſitians, becauſe they who have it are continually asking new Med<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The Flux of the Hemorrhoids doth good in this Diſeaſe, if it be moderate; but if it continue long it is dangerous.</p>
                     <p>A thick Urine is better in this Diſeaſe, than a thin and watery, which ſhews that the thick Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors are detained in the Body. Black Urine without a Feaver, doth often Cure this Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>Its good in this Diſeaſe to have a looſe Belly, and bad to be bound. Alſo Vomiting, if the Patient be refreſhed thereby, is profitable; but if it continue long, it is dangerous.</p>
                     <p>A Giddineſs, and continual pain in the Head in this Diſeaſe, ends in an Epilepſie, Blindneſs, or Apoplexy.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of this Diſeaſe, is in three things chiefly: firſt in opening Obſtructions: ſecondly in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the diſtempers of the Bowels: and in diſcharging of the peccant humor, not omitting ſtrengtheners: For which a wiſe Phyſitian may uſe theſe following.</p>

                     <p>When he goes forth of the bath, let the Region of his Liver be anointed with the Cerat of Sanders, or Oyntment of Roſes waſhed in Oxycrate.</p>
                     <p>After his laſt bath, let the Hemorrhoids be provoked with ſharp Suppoſitories, or with rubbing the Anus with Fig Leaves, or with a rough linnen Cloth; and with two or three Horſ-leeches apphed to the moſt apparant places, take away five or ſix ounces of blood. And this muſt be done every Spring and Fall, and ſomtimes once a Month.</p>
                     <p>They who are uſed to have the Flux of the Hemorrhoids, if it hath been long ſtopped, ſo that they wil not appear, muſt have a Cupping Glaſs applied.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Or inſtead of the Syrup, you may give Pils, eſpecially in Winter, ſuch as were mentioned in the Obſtruction of the Liver; or if you fear they are too hot, you may make theſe following:</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>If you cannot conveniently give often Purges, it is good every other day to give a Clyſter to revel vapors, and draw forth ſome part of the Humor: for if they go deep into the Guts, they take away the greateſt part of the filth from the Meſeraicks. We knew a Noble Man, who being long troubled with this Diſeaſe, was cured by often Clyſters, when other Medicines did nothing.</p>

                     <p>You may make Lozenges thus:</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Or you may make them more pleaſant thus:</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Amber-greece alone, given five or ſix grains at a time every day with Wine or Roſe Water, doth cheer the Spirits and the Natural Heat, and much rejoyce the Heart.</p>
                     <p>Some Authors do much commend the uſe of Bezoar ſtone againſt all Melanchollick Diſeaſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it doth much ſtrengthen the Heart, and you may give five or ſix grains in Roſe Water, or other Liquor.</p>
                     <p>After the Body is well purged, if it be Spring or Summer, you may give Whey for fifteen or twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty daies, which will open the Obſtructions of the Bowels, and amend the hot diſtemper.

                     <p>You muſt proportion the quantity according to the ſtrength of the Stomach. For if it can eaſily paſs through the Veins, being ſomwhat open, and be ſent forth by ſtool and urine, it is good to give it in great quantities, as Mineral Waters preſcribed in the hot diſtemper of the Liver, with this Caution, That you ſtrengthen the Stomach with Baggs, and other things hereafter mentioned, and give every day at evening a Cordial ſtrengthening Opiate. Inſtead of Epithimum, you may mix with the Whey, the juyce of Succory, Borrage, or of any other proper cool Herb, thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Goat Whey four or five pints: the juyce of freſh Lemmons four ounces: the new juyce of ſweet Apples ſix ounces: Conſerve of Roſes or Violets, or white Sugar, one ounce. Clarifie theſe with whites of Eggs. Let him take every morning three or four more Cups thereof, if his Stomach will bear it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In Bodies that are very lean, after the Obſtructions are a little opened, you may give Aſſes Milk with Sugar of Roſes; and if there be rumbling in the Hypochondria, a little Aromaticum Roſatum, or Diarrhodon Abbatis wil do very wel.</p>
                     <p>But your ſharp and Vitriol Mineral Waters, are beyond all Medicines, which by correcting the diſtemper of the bowels, do powerfully open Obſtructions, eſpecially the warmeſt, which do make the Humor thin, and clenſe it.</p>
                     <p>There is great diſpute among Authors concerning drinking thoſe Waters. Some (with <hi>Sennertus</hi>) do allow it, becauſe they receive Vertue from their Minerals, and do thereby both clenſe the paſſages, and ſend forth the filthy Humors which ſtick to them by ſtool and Urine: they warm the Stomach, and ſtrengthen the Liver and Spleen: And we may rather fear that theſe Waters wil hurt by the uſe of them external than internal, by heating and drying. Others (with <hi>Claudinus</hi>) do altogether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them, by reaſon of their drying quality. Others (with <hi>Montanus</hi>) do neither altogether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject them, nor wholly approve of them; they ſay they are good, by reaſon of the coldneſs of the Stomach, which is alwaies in this Diſeaſe, and by reaſon of Obſtructions. But in regard the Liver and Spleen are hot, they wil have them defended with the cool Oyntment of <hi>Galen.</hi> And alſo the Loyns, for then (ſaith he) the water will not hurt, becauſe it ſtaies longer in the Stomach, and cold places, but only paſſeth through other parts. We ſuppoſe that the uſe of them is convenient, if the Stomach being cold have much thick and clammy flegm in it, and if the heat of the Liver be not very
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:49088:172"/>
great. Which part is not like to ſuffer, if the aforeſaid Oyntment be not only given, but alſo cool Broths after the Waters; and after they have been uſed enough, cold and moiſtening baths for ſome daies.</p>
                     <p>Medicines made of Steel, uſe to be of great Vertue to open theſe Obſtructions, ſuch as are mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Obſtruction of the Liver, and of the Spleen, avoiding thoſe which do heat and dry much. In hot bodies you may give Steel prepared with Brimſtone or Vinegar, with Conſerve of Borrage and Succory, made in the form of an Opiate.</p>
                     <p>For dainty folk, the Syrup of Steel afore mentioned in the Obſtruction of the Liver and Spleen, is excellent; or the Froth which remains in the Glaſs after the Evaporation of the Wine which hath been often ſteeled, mixed with the aforeſaid Conſerves.</p>
                     <p>But Salt or Vitriol of ſron goes beyond all Medicines, becauſe it opens Obſtructions, ſtrengthens the Bowels, and qualifies their heat. The Doſe is from twelve to twenty grains, with a fit Liquor, Syrup, or Conſerve. But becauſe it is diſpleaſing to the taſte, I uſe to make it into Pils with the Mucilage of Gum Tragacanth. You muſt uſe it long, and therefore get a great quantity, which is not eaſie to be got after the way that <hi>Beguinus</hi> and others make it. We will ſhew you the eaſie way of making it, which few men know.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Oyl of Vitriol, or of Sulphur, half a pint: the Spirit of Wine one pint: Put them in a new Iron Pan that is clean, and cover them well; within fifteen daies of them there will be a Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like gathering, which you muſt ſet in the Sun to dry it throughly, ſomtimes ſtirring it with an Iron Spatula: In Winter you may dry it upon a gentle fire, or in a Hot-houſe. Let the Salt being well dried, be kept in a cloſe Glaſs; for if it be expoſed to the Air, it eaſily turneth moiſt. Alſo the Pills that are made thereof, of Tragacanth, muſt be hardened with the Pouder of Tragacanth, and after put in a Glaſs, otherwiſe they will grow moiſt. You may continue this Medicine for a month or two, not only without hurt, but with great profit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fonſeca</hi> commends theſe Pils following, which he cals <hi>Diatartarum,</hi> for opening Obſtructions by degrees, and purging Melancholly gently, and for allaying it.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of the Pouder of Senna, and Salt of Tartar, of each one dram: Pouder of Cinnamon half a ſcruple: with Syrup of Lemmons make a Maſs, of which give three Pills made of half a dram one hour before Supper, to give him two or three ſtools, for Salt of Tartar hath great Vertue to allay black melanchollick Humors; for it draweth to it ſelf by certain propriety ſowr things, as you may perceive when it is mixed with Vinegar, or Spirit of Vitriol, whoſe ſowrneſs it taketh away: For we muſt know, that</hi> Fonſeca <hi>by Salt of Tartar, meaneth Cryſtal of Tartar. Yet you may as well infuſe your Senna with the Salt of Tartar, and ſome drops of Spirit of Vitriol in ſome conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Liquor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To open the ſame Obſtructions, ſome commend the Decoction of China, as we ſaid in the Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Spleen; which a wiſe Phyſitian may do with good ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>Some commend the Juyce of VVormwood thickened into the form of a Pill, given either by its ſelf, or with Gum Ammoniacum; and after that preſently, Oxymel made of the Decoction of Aſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Roots and Liquoris.</p>
                     <p>Others ſay, That Hypochondriack Melancholly hath been cured with the Decoction or Wine of Wormwood taken thirty or forty daies together.</p>
                     <p>The Juyce of Bugloſs is excellent, not to open Obſtructions as Wormwood, but to qualifie the Melanchollick Humor. Therefore they give two ounces thereof with two drams of Sugar, and as much Wine as of both, for ten or twelve daies every morning.</p>
                     <p>The principal thing for this Cure, is to keep the Body alwaies ſoluble: Therfore the Patient muſt have ſome familiar Medicines, which he may often uſe before meat, ſomtimes one, ſomtimes another, leſt he grow weary of them. For this he may take the Magiſterial Syrup, and the aforeſaid Pils, and thoſe which were pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>cribed for a coſtive Belly. To which he may add (out of <hi>Montanus</hi>) Venice Turpentine, which he orders to be ſwallowed in the quantity of an Acron, three hours before dinner, once, twice, or thrice in a week: for beſides that it looſeneth the belly, it alſo clenſeth the Stomach, opens Obſtructions, provokes Urine, warms the Stomach, and doth not heat the Liver, but doth it good by opening and clenſing it.</p>
                     <p>For his ordinary Drink let him uſe Water wherein Gold hath been quenched, or the infuſion of Tamarisk, Agrimony, Burnet in thin Wine, either alone, or made Phyſical in Vintage time with the Roots of Bugloſs, Borrage, with a little white Sanders and Roſemary Flowers.</p>
                     <p>The Decoction of the Sweet Bryar Root, is commended for ordinary Drink; for it openeth and ſtrengtheneth all natural parts.</p>
                     <p>The Decoction of <hi>Lignum Nephriticum</hi> doth open the Obſtructions of the Bowels without any manifeſt alteration. But ſteeled Water is more uſual. All which Waters and Decoctions, you may alſo mix with Wine.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="357" facs="tcp:49088:172"/>While in the internal Medicines mentioned or any of them are uſed, you muſt apply External, as Fomentations, and Oyntments to the Hypochondria, ſuch as are preſcribed for the Obſtructions of the Liver and Spleen, making Choice of the Cooleſt.</p>
                     <p>You muſt alſo apply ſtrengthners to the Stomach, becauſe that part doth alwaies ſuffer in this Diſeaſe; therefore you may uſe thoſe Fomentations, Oyntments, and Emplaiſters mentioned in the Diſeaſes of the Stomach: Alſo thoſe Internal which wil not inflame the Liver; and eſpecially the Digeſtive Pouder to be taken after meat: in a Fit when the Vapors ariſing from the Hypochondria do trouble the Heart, Brain, and other parts, and produce great Symptomes, as Swoonings, Palpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Tremblings, Convulſions, Head-ach, and the like; you may uſe thoſe things which are given in Swooning, or the Mother; but among the reſt Laudanum uſed wiſely, doth wonders.</p>

                        <hi>Chap. 6.</hi> Of the Scurvy.</head>
                     <p>THe Scurvy is uſual in the North, in moſt places thereof Common, but almoſt unknown in the South; ſo that al Writers that have Practiced in theſe Parts, have never mentioned it: and we may wel leave it out, becauſe in our Preface to this Book we promiſed to meddle only with the uſual Diſeaſes of the Spleen; but Experience hath taught us, That our Country is not altogether without it, for though it be not in every Symptom the ſame with that of the North, yet it hath enough to confirm it to be the ſame: for the aforeſaid Authors ſay that one Symptome is ſufficient to diſcover it; we have ſeen many Symptomes of it in many people, but becauſe it is not familiar here, and al our Phyſitians ſay we have it not, we would not abſolutely cal it a Scurvy, but we thought it better to cal it a Scorbutical Diſeaſe, ſuch an one as comes next to it, though it be not a true Scurvy.</p>
                     <p>For the Scurvy is nothing elſe but an Hypochondriack Diſeaſe, having a peculiar degree of Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity from which more Symptomes ariſe than in the Hypochondriack Diſeaſe: this malignity comes from the putrefaction of Melancholly, not of every kind of melancholly, for it is often corrupted, from which other Diſeaſes ariſe and not the Scurvy, as a Quartan Ague <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

And eſpecially Elephantiaſis comes from a peculiar malignity in a Melanchollick Humor, and ſo doth the Scurvy, and yet theſe two Diſeares differ ſo much, that none can tel their divers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of malignity.</p>
                     <p>Divers Symptomes common to both, do ſhew a great likeneſs of the Scurvy and Hypochondriack Melancholly: for al they which were mentioned in the former Chapter, are found in this Diſeaſe, as crudities and want of Concoction in the ſtomach, often ſpitting, flegmatick, ſharp, and ſtinking vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitings, noiſe in the Hypochondria, belchings, breaking of Wind downwards, vomiting of blood, and purging of blood, pains from wind under the ribs and in the ſtomach, ſomtimes Coſtiveneſs, and ſomtimes Looſeneſs, heat in the Hypochondria, beating of the Left ſide, Urine now thin, than thick, heart beating, thirſt, drought of the mouth, ſhort breath, head-ach, noiſe in the ears, dimneſs of ſight, giddineſs, ſorrow and ſadneſs, and divers dolings, convulſions, falling-ſicknes, numbneſs, coma, wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings, troubled ſleep, and terrible dreams: The Reaſons of al which were ſhewed in the Chapter above, and they may agree with this of the Scurvy.</p>
                     <p>But if any Symptomes appear beſides theſe, which are not found in that, nor mentioned by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, nor belong to another Diſeaſe; you may conjecture that it is the Scurvy: The Chief are theſe, which are not al ſound in one Patient; but one of them is ſufficient to ſhew that the Diſeaſe is ſuch.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt moſt remarkable Sign is in the Gums, Mouth, and Teeth, in the Gums redneſs, itching, and putrefaction, and ſomtimes bleeding and ſtink, which are ſomtimes in the Palate, Jaws, and Teeth, which are looſe and black.</p>
                     <p>The Second, which is an evident Sign alſo, is Spots in the Legs which at firſt are Red, and after Purple, blue, and black: Somtimes there are in the Legs broad ſpots, black or blue, or both; theſe come from the ſerous filthy part of the blood which is unfit to nouriſh the body, and therefore is ſent by nature out of the Veins to the Skin, by the Nauſioſis of the Veins, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaies of Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, and this happens often in the Shins and Legs, becauſe nature uſeth to ſend the worſt Humors
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:49088:173"/>
to the moſt ignoble and remoteſt parts; ſomtimes when there is more plenty of matter you ſhal find them in the back, arms, neck, and face.</p>
                     <p>The third ſign is ſhortneſs of Breath, and ſtraightneſs of the Breaſt, which comes commonly from thick vapors, ariſing from the Hypochondria, that get to the Midriff, as alſo from Tumors and ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings by wind of thoſe parts that preſs upon the Midriff, eſpecially from the Twelling of the Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread, which commonly in this Diſeaſe is fulled with groſs Melancholly: Hence the Patients com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain not of their Breaſt, but of the part affected, whereby they feel the weight, and by reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Breath is ſhort, as <hi>Eugalenus</hi> noted well, who was much acquainted with this Diſeaſe, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Obſervations therein: yet he knew not the cauſe of this weight, namely, the ſwelling of the Sweet-bread; nor doth any that write hereof make mention of it. Yet we obſerved it in My Lord <hi>Audeyer,</hi> Preſident of the Senate of Gratianopolis, whom we thought had the Scurvy, as you may reade in his Hiſtory, at length, in our Obſervations, Cent. 3. Obſ. 85. For being very lean, we did eaſily perceive with our fingers, a hardneſs in the Sweet-bread; and by handling of the part, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that all his ſhortneſs of Breath and ſtraightneſs came from thence.</p>
                     <p>The fourth ſign, is Lazineſs, and heavine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s of Body, eſpecially in the Legs, which comes from wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and foul Humors, which come through the Veins to the Muſcles, and the whol Body.</p>
                     <p>The fifth ſign is in the Urine, which is divers, as in Hypochondriack Melancholly; but in this they ſomtimes differ, becauſe they are cleer and red like a Lye, from the plenty of ſalt Humors. The redneſs is higher and inclining to black, by how much the more ſalt humor there is. As in a Lixivium ſomtimes the Urine is very thick, with a red thick ſediment, like the Pouder of Bricks, and ſomtimes this Humor is ſo much, that it cauſeth burning and piſſing by drops, eſpecially in them who have this Diſeaſe from ſtoppage of the Hemorrhoids; and after it is ſetled, the third or fourth part of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinal is filled with thick and black filth, which makes ſome think it to be the Stone or Ulcer of the Bladder.</p>
                     <p>Somtimes the Urine varieth without manifeſt cauſe; to day thick, to morrow thin; now pale, then yellow, or red.</p>
                     <p>The ſixth ſign is from the Pulſe, which is now weak and unequal, leaping, or formicans, that you would wonder he ſhould live with it; anon it is great and hard, without Inflamation. And this is to be obſerved, That in time of fainting and ſwooning, with which he is often troubled, his Pulſe is greateſt and ſtrongeſt. Which comes from the Heart contending to caſt out thoſe vapors with which it is oppreſſed.</p>
                     <p>The ſeventh ſign, is pain in divers parts: in the Thighs heavy, and ſomtimes ſtretching; ſomtimes <hi>Oſtokopos,</hi> or at the bone; ſomtimes in the Shins, Ankles, Soals of the Feet, in the taps of the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, in the Hips, Knees, and other Joynts, or parts to which the Salt Humors flow; ſomtimes in the Belly, like the Chollerick Chollick; and it comes from theſe Humors flowing upon the Caul: theſe in the Arms, Thighs, and Legs, are like thoſe of the Pox, and may wel deceive a Phyſitian in <hi>France,</hi> where the Scurvy is rare, and the Pox common.</p>
                     <p>But they may be thus diſtinguiſhed; The pains in the Pox are between the Joynts and if they ſtay long, make knots, and there are, or have been then alſo other Symptomes of it, as running of the Reins, Ulcer of the Yard, Bubo, and the like, or Uncleanneſs with Women. But the Scurvy pains ſeize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on al parts indifferently; and then there are other ſigns of it, or at leaſt a Melanchollick Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and the Matter is certainly known, if the Patient wil truly ſay that he hath not been with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Women. Which cauſed our ſuſpicion in a Magiſtrate, who had a long time great pain in his Feet, Shins, and Thighs, and was brought very lean, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o that you would have thought that he had the Maraſmus, or Conſumption: And when no Medicines for a long time would do him good, we from his Melanchollick Complexion, and other ſigns, eſpecially becauſe he le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Somtimes thoſe pains remain in the Hypochondria, ſomtimes in the Loyns, ſo that they are weak, and can ſcarcego. Hence this Diſeaſe is called <hi>Lumbago.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Somtimes the pains are like the Stone, and the Urine is very red or black; and if you do not dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently obſerve, you will think they are bloody, and that it comes from the Reins wounded by the Stone, when it is from a ſcurvy ſalt Matter in the Spleen, and parts adjacent, ſent into the Urine.</p>
                     <p>Some have Head-ach, and heat at nights, if they caught this Diſeaſe from ſtoppage of the Hemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoids, by reaſon of the vapors which aſcend, and all the night after they are as in a Feaver all over their Bodies, which the next morning vaniſheth by ſweating.</p>
                     <p>They have often the Tooth-ach, without any evident reaſon or cauſe; and it is not in one place, but movable from one Tooth to another, making them looſe, and they again fix of their own accord, the pain and tumor being diſcuſſed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="359" facs="tcp:49088:173"/>Somtimes the pain of the Scurvy is in the ſides, imitating the Pleuriſie; from which it is eaſily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed, becauſe it is without a Feaver, at leaſt a ſtrong one; the breath is not hindered, there is no Cough, no ſpitting, nor is the pain conſtant, but coming by fits.</p>
                     <p>Alſo it will be in the Joynts; and we muſt declare how it is diſtinguiſhed from a true Arthritis, or Joynt-gout. The pain of the Joynts in the Scurvy, is not fixed and conſtant in the ſame place, but runs from one Joynt to another, either on the ſame, or on the contrary ſide; ſomtimes it vaniſheth, and then returns; ſo that he which now ſeems free, and in perfect health, is ſuddenly taken with pain, ſomtimes with ſwelling, ſomtimes without. But a true Joynt-gout ſeldom changeth the place.</p>
                     <p>The Joynt Scurvy hath this peculiar diſtinction: It is for the moſt part joyned with a ſmal Palſey, by reaſon whereof the Patient can hardly move the part affected; and when the Paſſey ſeizeth or returneth, the pain doth ſo alſo.</p>
                     <p>The eighth ſign is from the divers hinderances of Motion, they have a baſtard Palſey; the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples whereof we laid down in our Obſervations: and it is diſtinguiſhed from a true Palſey, becauſe this is conſtant; but in the Palſey from the Scurvy, he that yeſterday could ſcarce ſet one foot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore another, can now ſtand, and walk with a little help, and it may be preſently after he cannot move at all: and ſomtimes the motion is trembling, and with Convulſion, which doth not happen in a true Palſey. And this kind of Palſey cometh from a filthy kind of Matter or vapor, which gets in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Nerves and Muſcles. And if the Matter be ſharp, it cauſeth trembling and Convulſion by pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Nervous parts.</p>
                     <p>And Convulſions are not only in ſome peculiar part, but ſomtimes in the whol Body like an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilepſie, by a windy or watery matter full of ſharpneſs, and malignity, which is ſent to the Brain, which being diſcuſſed doth give eaſe, and gathered again, maketh new Convulſions.</p>
                     <p>Alſo in this Diſeaſe there is a Contraction of the Members, ſomtimes of all; ſo that the Patient cannot move one Joynt; ſomtimes of one, and that principally in the Leg, when the Tendons which are made to move the Leg grow hard and ſtiff in the Hams. This contraction comes by reaſon of the ſalt Humor that flows with much moiſture to the Nerves and Tendons; and when the thin and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery part, through continuance of time is conſumed, the thick is dried and made hard; from whence come theſe contractions of Nerves and Tendons.</p>
                     <p>Somtimes there is a contraction in the Gullet, ſo that the Patient can ſcarce ſwallow, and is in fear of ſtrangling. And this comes from aſtringent vapors, which contract the Oeſophagus, or Gullet.</p>
                     <p>The ninth ſign, is the Flux of the Belly, either with, or without blood. The ſimple Flux which is without blood, is diſtinguiſhed from others, in that the Excrements are thicker, and more than the quantity of meat that is taken; when a common Flux is more thin, and of Humors only.</p>
                     <p>The Flux of blood in this Diſeaſe is diſtinguiſhed from a Dyſentery, becauſe it is without pain of the belly, and it is thick blood which is ſent into the Guts by the Meſeraick Veins. Somtimes the Hemorrhoid Veins do receive that filthy blood, and ſend it forth: but if this flux of the belly conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues long, the Vein<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The tenth ſign, is a ſtinking Breath, which is common to all in the Scurvy, as <hi>Eugalenus</hi> witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, ſo that they which ſtand by cannot endure it, but muſt turn aſide their Noſe.</p>
                     <p>The eleventh ſign, is often ſhivering, with none or little heat following it.</p>
                     <p>The twelfth ſign, is an intermitting Feaver, which ſomtimes they have, which are unlike the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ordinary Agues of Feavers: for in them the Pulſe is weak, ſlow, and unequal, eſpecially in the declination; but in the height it is commonly great and hard. Beſides, at the firſt coming there is ſuch a twitching in divers parts, eſpecially the Legs, that they ſuppoſe their fleſh to be torn; and ſomtimes they have convulſive motions therewith. And though ſomtimes this Ague is a Quotidian, Tertian, or Quartan, yet ſomtimes the fits are diſorderly, coming once it may be, or twice in a month, without certainty.</p>
                     <p>The Thirteenth Sign is Tumors in divers parts; ſomtimes hard, ſomtimes ſoft like bladders, and ſomtimes like an Eryſipelas, or red Tumor.</p>
                     <p>The Fourteenth Sign is Atrophy or Conſumption; which is ſo great in this Diſeaſe ſomtimes that they are nothing but skin and bones like a Sceleton or Anatomy; eſpecially after long ſickneſs, which comes from the evil blood; ſo changed from its natural Condition that it cannot be made like unto the parts which ſhould nouriſh.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eugalenus</hi> propounds many other Signs of the Scurvy, and <hi>Sennertus</hi> with others: ſome whereof are Common to many other Diſeaſes, which we will Conceal, leaſt they breed Confuſion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="360" facs="tcp:49088:174"/>And though (as we ſaid before) the Scurvy is not ordinary in France, as in Poland and other Northren parts, and almoſt unknown; yet if any in Practiſing Phyſick ſhal obſerve al the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes of Melancholly he ſhal find ſome inclining to the Scurvy, in whom ſome of the former Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes proper to the Scurvy wil appear.</p>
                     <p>As to the Prognoſtick: This Diſeaſe is hard to be Cured, as al other that come of Melancholly, and here much more hard, becauſe of the malignity in the Melancholly which doth more cruelly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow the body, and wil not obey the greateſt part of Medicines.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo dangerous becauſe it many times brings a Conſumption or Dropſie, and deſtroyes others by ſudden death, by an Apoplexy, Swooning, and other acute Diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>Yet ſomtimes they who have ſeemed deſperate have been Cured, and oftener in this Diſeaſe than in any other: And we have ſeen ſome brought to a Conſumption by long pain, and bloody Flux (which by many circumſtances we conclude to be from the Scurvy) to have been perfectly Cured.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, The Pulſe is deceitful, eſpecially in the Fits; it wil be ſo quick, ſmal, and unequal ſomtimes that the Patient ſeems to be at deaths door; yet after his Fit he wil riſe from his bed, and is as formerly; As we peculiarly obſerved in a Dutch Schollar, unto whom we being ſent for in the time of his Fit, thought that he would preſently die; but the next day we ſaw him ſeemingly in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good health; and when we had examined the Circumſtances of the Diſeaſe, we Concluded that he had the Scurvy, which he brought out of his own Country where it is very uſual.</p>
                     <p>The ſame Cure is to be uſed in this Diſeaſe as in Hypochondriack Melancholly: becauſe as we ſaid at the firſt it comes from the ſame Humor more differing from its natural ſtate; therfore for the moſt part it needs ſtronger Medicines.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe this is a general Rule in Phyſick, That we alwaies begin with the weakeſt Medicines, and ſo proceed to ſtronger, if the former will not cure: It will be good in this Diſeaſe to appoint the whol courſe of Cure for Hypochondriack Melancholly, becauſe a ſtubborn diſeaſe requires a long courſe; and if that will not root out the Diſeaſe, let us then uſe the Medicines more ſpecifically proper: Aud it will not be amiſs to mix ſome ſuch with the other at the beginning.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Specifical Medicines are called <hi>Antiſcorbutica,</hi> or Medicin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Moreover, they have a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain preſervative and oppoſing Vertue againſt the poyſon of the Scurvy which is in the Melanchollick Humor.

Hence it is that we directed the Cure againſt Hypochondriack Melancholly to be uſed here: Thoſe are, Carduus, Ceterach, all the Capillar Herbs, Hyſop, Germander, Bettony, Agrimony, Borrage, Bugloſs, Elicampane, Aſarum, Ditch Dock, Polypody of the Oak, Capar, Aſh, and Tamarisk barks, Flowers of Elder, Tamarisk, and Dodder of Time.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Any Authors are very ſhort in the explaining of the Diſeaſes of the Meſentery, Sweet-bread, and Caul; and the moſt of them have left them out, becauſe they are hard to be known, and for the moſt part only from Diſſection of dead Bodies; as appears by ſtories in <hi>Schenkius, Sennertus,</hi> and others. Yet they are very ordinary and uſual: from whence <hi>Fernelius</hi> ſaith, That oftentimes there are cauſes of many Diſeaſes in the Meſentery: as of Choller, Melancholly, Diarrhoea, Dyſentery, evil Habit, Conſumption, Faintneſs, of lingering Feavers, Vomitings, Chollicks, Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, and Impoſthumes. And <hi>Sylvius</hi> called the Meſentery, the Mother of many Diſeaſes: by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhe is called the Phyſitians Nurſe. We may ſay the ſame of the Sweet-bread and Caul; for they are ignoble parts, and as it were ſinks of the Body, to which the noble Members do ſend their Excrements. And although theſe parts (as all other) are ſubject to all kinds of Diſeaſes, Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary, Organical, and Common, and many Symptomes ariſe from them; yet we will only ſpeak of thoſe which are moſt in practice, and comprehend this Book in five Chapters.

                     <p>THeſe Obſtructions in the Meſentery, come of the ſame Cauſes which are mentioned in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of the Liver and Spleen; but they happen more eaſily, and more often, by reaſon of the ſtraitneſs of the Meſeraick Veins, and eſpecially of the Milky Veins, which carry the Chylous Matter to the place of the ſecond Concoction: and when that Chylous Matter is filled with crude and
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:49088:175"/>
thick juyce it comes to paſs that not having a free paſſage, it ſticks in thoſe little Veins and makes Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions. Alſo the Meſeraick Veins are ſtopped by thick Humors ſent from the Liver, Spleen, and other parts, and there continuing till they grow thicker, ſo that ſomtimes they cauſe a Scirrhus. With theſe Humors ſomtimes groſs Vapors are mixed, which uſe to be the cauſe of great Symptomes. To the Obſtruction, or rather making narrow of theſe Veins, we refer compreſſion, which comes from the Glandles which are ſpread through the whol ſubſtance of the Meſentery: for when theſe grow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond meaſure, as in thoſe who have the Kings Evil, or Struma, they compreſs the Meſeraick Veins, and hinder both the paſſage of the Chylus, and of the Blood.</p>
                     <p>The Signs of theſe Obſtructions are to be divided into three kinds, as we did in the Obſtructions of the Liver; namely, into ſuch as ſhew the Diſeaſe, the Part affected, or the Cauſe.</p>
                     <p>The Signs of the Diſeaſe (that is) of the Obſtructions lying in the Hypochondria, and alſo the Signs of the Cauſes are the ſame with the Obſtruction of the Liver and Spleen, and are from that Chapter to be taken. But thoſe Signs which properly ſhew the peculiar Diſeaſe of the Meſentery, are ſtretching, and reſiſtance in the middle of the Belly, and under the Stomach, and about the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel; a weight in the ſame parts, and ſomtimes a dull pain, and ſomtimes a moſt ſharp, when wind is contained in thoſe parts; ſomtimes there is pain in the back, becauſe the Meſentery is tied to that part: there is rumbling in the Belly, belching, and vapors flying to the Head, from whence come divers Symptomes: and laſtly, all thoſe which uſe to happen in Hypochondriack Melancholly, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie Obſtruction of the Meſentery, becauſe that alſo proceeds, and is maintained by the ſame Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſtick: This Diſeaſe of its ſelf, is not dangerous, becauſe an ignoble part can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure great evils without danger of death: moreover, you may apply ſtrong Medicines for the Cure, which being well adminiſtred, do commonly bring about the deſired effect; except Hypochondriack Melancholly riſe from thence, which uſeth to be called the ſhame of Phyſitians, by reaſon of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Nature of the Melanchollick Humor. But becauſe this part hath not exquiſite ſence, and the Obſtructions do not alwaies greatly diſturb the Patient, they are often neglected, and become the cauſes of other moſt dangerous diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of this Diſeaſe is the ſame with that of the Obſtruction of the Liver, and you muſt fetch it from the Chapter treating thereof.</p>

                        <hi>Chap. 2.</hi> Of the Inflamation of the Meſentery.</head>
                     <p>WHen the Meſentery, as I ſaid, is as it were the ſink into which the Noble Parts do ſend their ſuperfluous Excrements, which afterwards are ſent forth by Nature, either by Vomit or Stool; as you may ſee in ſome who ſend abundance of Humors forth at divers times by Vomit and Stool: if thoſe Evacuations be hindered by ſtoppage of the waies by which they are made, or by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other cauſe, thoſe Humors which are there detained, ſtaying long in the part, do get a preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral heat, from whence come putrefactions, inflamations, divers Feavers, and impoſthumes. But an Inflamation is peculiarly made, when blood heaped up in the Meſeraick Veins, by the opening of ſome branch is ſent into the ſubſtance of the Meſentery: but becauſe by reaſon of Obſtructions it is chiefly gathered in thoſe Veins, therefore all the cauſes of Obſtructions may be referred to the Cauſes of Inflamation.</p>
                     <p>For the making of this Inflamation, that ſharpneſs and gnawing of the Humors gathered together, do much conduce, a fall or ſtroak upon the Belly, the weakneſs of the attractive concoction, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive faculty of the Liver; too much heat of the body, or inordinate uſe of cooling things; the critical motion of Nature in malignant Diſeaſes, or ſmal Pox, by which it ſends the peccant Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors into this ſink; a Diarrhoea, or Dyſentery ſuddenly ſtopped.</p>
                     <p>The ſigns of the Inflamation of the Meſentery are, a lingering Feaver without Thirſt, and great Symptomes, want of Appetite, a ſence of ſtretching and heavineſs beneath the Stomach, without great hardneſs, and which is not felt but by the hand preſſing of it, and without pain, worth the ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of, becauſe the part is of dull ſence; Chollerick ſtools, which commonly hath thin matter, without pain, ſomtimes pure, ſomtimes mixed with Excrements.</p>
                     <p>If the Meſentery be only inflamed, all the aforeſaid Symptomes are milder: But if the Liver or Spleen, or Guts, are alſo inflamed, all the Symptomes are ſtronger: And beſides, the ſigns of the aforeſaid parts affected will appear, which are to be taken out of their proper Chapters.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe the Inflamation and Impoſthume of this part, are very hard to be known if they be alone, by reaſon of the dull ſence of the part, and becauſe it performeth no action in the body, whoſe hinderance may be perceived; but only ſerveth for the diſtribution of the Chylus and the Blood: therefore they are rather to be diſcovered by conſequence, than directly, and according to artificial
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:49088:176"/>
conjecture; namely, when there is a Feaver and other Symptomes, and no ſign of the Liver, Spleen, or Guts diſtempered. A half Tertian Ague ſheweth that the Guts are inflamed with the Meſentery; which <hi>Spigelius</hi> obſerved to come commonly from the Inflamation of theſe parts. Alſo this Difeaſe is diſtinguiſhed from the inflamation of the Muſcles of the Belly, becauſe the Tumor and pain is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged according to their proportion, and they are commonly long, or over the whol belly, and more in the outward parts, ſo that they are perceived by the leaſt touch, and they uſe to bring great pain, and a Feaver.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, This Diſeaſe is to be diſtinguiſhed from the Humors of the Midriff, which have been, as yet, known to few Phyſitians: for in them there is alwaies great difficulty of breathing, removing of the Hypochondria, a Pulſe hard and ſmal, without any ſence of Tumor in the Hypochondria. And if the Tumor come of a hot cauſe, a ſharp Feaver, great pain, doting, and Convulſions do follow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which Symptomes never happen when the Meſentery is only inflamed.</p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſtick: This Diſeaſe is very dangerous; for it either ends in an impoſthume, or there follows a rottenneſs, and corruption of the Meſentery. Oftentimes the Matter of the Diſeaſe is ſent by Nature another way, and yet is not clean taken away, whence the Diſeaſe returns, and continues for many yeers, ſomtimes till death, now with a Feaver, then a Chollick, or Infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of the Inflamation of the Meſentery, is not unlike to that of the Liver and Spleen, and therefore you muſt peruſe that.</p>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>igns in the former Chapter, it is a ſign that the Inflamation could not be diſcuſſed, but ſuppurated and turned into an Impoſthume. But when an Impoſthume comes from evil Humors remaining long in the Meſentery, and at length putrefying, it is hard to know it; ſo that many Authors who have written Obſervations upon ſuch kind of Impoſthumes, ſay, that they never were known, but after death, when the Bodies were open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For although for the moſt part, they may be known by the touch, yet ſomtimes they lie ſo deep, that they cannot be touched, and the part being dull in ſence, that they will not be diſcovered by pain. But becauſe they come divers waies, they muſt be thus diſtinguiſhed.</p>
                     <p>If the Impoſthume of the Meſentery, hath a viſible Tumor, it is firſt to be di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ew an Inflamation; but if it follow an Inflamation, it can no other waies be diſtinguiſhed than by hardneſs &amp; continuance; for if the ſigns of Inflamation have continued twenty or thirty daies, it is a ſign that it is turned into an Impoſthume. It is diſtinguiſhed from a Scirrhus by hardneſs, which is great in a Scirrhus, but in an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſthume there is ſome kind of ſoftneſs, as alſo by the want of pain altogether; for in an Impoſthume there is alwaies ſome pain, eſpecially if it be preſſed hard. Moreover, this Tumor is diſtinguiſhed from the Tumor of other parts, by the Scituation thereof, as we ſaid before of the Inflamation of the Meſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. But if the Impoſthume lie in the Meſentery without any viſible Tumor, there can be no certain ſign, but by an artificial conjecture we may ſuſpect, namely, if there be loathing of Meat, or vomiting without manifeſt fault of the Stomach, and a great fulneſs after little Meat, wearineſs of the whol Body, and fainting without manifeſt cauſe, if the Belly be unaccuſtomarily bound, or looſe, and void ſtinking Excrements, and ſomtimes bloody, without ſuſpicion of a Dyſentery. To theſe you may add great watchings, and if they ſleep they faint, and have great Sweats. And though ſomtimes there appear neither Feaver nor pain, yet there is commonly an obſcure one; of which, if there appear no manifeſt cauſe, we muſt conjecture that it comes from this Diſeaſe, eſpecially if any of the aforeſaid
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:49088:176"/>
ſigns be joyned there with; as alſo if the Abdomen be violently preſſed, the Patient will perceive ſome inward pain: it is true, that by violent compreſſion you may cauſe pain in ſound places; but if you perceive more pain in one part than in another, after all parts have been preſſed, and when that part is alwaies moſt pained, and the more by preſſing, you may ſtrongly conjecture that the impoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hume is there.</p>
                     <p>If at length there come forth Matter, then the Impoſthume will be manifeſt. Commonly it is voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by ſtool of divers ſorts according to the diſpoſition of the part affected, and of thoſe adjacent.</p>
                     <p>Hence one while the Matter is pure and white in great plenty, without ſence of pain, when it is ſent by the Meſeraick Veins into the Guts, ſomtimes when the Impoſthume is in the thick and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Guts, the Matter is mixed with the Excre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ents, ſomtimes it is ſent to the Reins, and caſt forth by Urine; ſomtimes being ſent in great quantities between the Peritonaeum, and the Muſcles of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen, it falls into the Cavity of the Belly by breaking of the Peritonaeum, or breaks outwardly by an Impoſthume, ſo that a great quantity of Matter flows from the Navel, and ſomtimes Worms there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, through the corruption of the Meſentery. And that which ſent forth by ſtool (which is the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual) is ſomtimes white and laudable, as was ſaid; ſomtimes mixed with blood or water, ſomtimes black blood, and ſtinking, ſomtimes other black Matter, or of divers colors. But whether this puru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Matter come from the Meſentery, Liver, Spleen, or other part, it is known by the proper ſigns of every part affected.</p>
                     <p>When the Impoſthume is broken, and the Matter floweth, it is certain that there is an Ulcer in the Meſentery, which ſomtimes is quickly cured, and ſomtimes it is of long continuance, and brings rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs upon the whol part, and a Gangrene.</p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſtick: The Impoſthume of the Meſentery is dangerous; for if it continue long in the part, as it often happens, it breeds filthy rottenneſs, or a Gangrene, or brings the Patient into a Conſumption or Dropſie. If it break, and the Ulcer be not quickly cured, but gets an evil condition, it hath the like event, a Gangrene, Conſumption, or Dropſie. Somtimes when the Impoſthume is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and very ſtinking Matter is ſent into the Cavity of the Belly, the Patient dies ſuddenly. The Scirrhus, or hard Tumor of the Meſentery is leſt dangerous, and if it be new will admit of a Cure; but if it be old, it brings the Patient to a Dropſie.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of theſe Diſeaſes, is to be varied according to the diverſity of them. And firſt, an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſthume bred requires opening and evacuation, and it muſt be ſoftened with opening and purging Medicines, ſuch as are laid down in the Obſtructions of the Liver and Spleen, not omitting outward Softeners and Looſeners, Fomentations, Cataplaſms, and Liniments, which do make the Matter of the Impoſthume thin, and open the paſſages that the Matter may better be voided.</p>
                     <p>After the Impoſthume is opened, you muſt clenſe the Ulcer and heal it; for which purpoſe the Remedies mentioned in the Cure of the Ulcers of the Stomach, Liver, Reins, and Womb, are very good; of which a wiſe Phyſitian may take his choyce according to the divers diſpoſitions both of the Bodies, and the Diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>And a Scirrhus of the Meſentery is cured with the ſame Medicines, which are ſet down for the Cure of the Scirrhus or hard Swelling of the Liver and Spleen.</p>

                        <hi>Chap. 4.</hi> Of the Diſeaſes of the <hi>Pancreas,</hi> or Sweet-bread.</head>
                     <p>THe Ancient Anatomiſts knew no action of the Pancreas, or Sweet-bread, but the uſe only<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> namely, to prop the Veſſels, leaſt they ſhould be in danger of breaking, and to be inſtead of a Pillow to the Stomach, leaſt when it is full it ſhould be hurt by the hardneſs of the Vertebrae or Back-bone. But the Modern Anatomiſts have aſcribed very great action unto it; namely, the firſt preparation of the Chyle, and clenſing of it, ſo that it may be brought to the Liver more pure; which the milky Veins ſeem to confirm, becauſe they are diſperſed through the Pancreas. Beſides, in the middle of it there is an open paſſage which goes to the Guts, by which it is probable that the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Chyle are purged; therefore the Pancreas hath its Diſeaſes, which hurt the whol Body, eſpecially Obſtructions and Tumors, as the Meſentery hath; namely, when the Chylous Matter is crude and thick, and is brought to it from the Stomach, not ſufficiently digeſted, and when it doth not freely flow from it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Riolanus</hi> obſerved a Scirrhus of the Pancreas, in <hi>Auguſtine Thuanus,</hi> that wrote the Hiſtory of his Times moſt elegantly in Latin; who when he had for four yeers, among other Symptomes, a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs continually in his Stomach, eſpecially when he walked or ſtood ſtill, without Swelling or hardneſs in the Hypochondria, had a Pancreas as big as his Liver, after he was dead, hard and Scir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus, full of knots like Pidgeons Eggs.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe the Pancreas is covered with the Stomach, its Tumors are ſcarce to be felt; and this is
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:49088:177"/>
the cauſe becauſe there is no mention commonly of them, and they have been found only after death: Yet you may make a handſom Conjecture of them, from what <hi>Riolanus</hi> obſerved in <hi>Thua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> namely, If there be a ſence of weight or heavineſs in the Stomach, and no Tumor or hardneſs in the Hypochondria; and other ſigns of Obſtructions than are mentioned in the Obſtructions of the Liver, Spleen, and Meſentery. To which you may add pain, and other Symptomes of the Stomach, by reaſon of its neerneſs, ſhortneſs of breath, by reaſon of the compreſſion of the Diaphragma; By which ſigns we ſuppoſe that the Lord <hi>Audeyerius,</hi> Preſident of the Senate of Gratianopolis, had a Scirrhus of the Pancreas, and we could perceive it by touching, by putting our hand deep to the ſides of the Stomach about the middle, becauſe he was lean; and we found a hardneſs there, which being touched, pained him: the ſtory whereof, is at larger related in our 81. Obſervation, Cent. 3. And in the knowledg of the Scurvy we obſerved (which none that ever wrote thereof did) That in all Scurvyes there is a Tumor of the Pancreas, becauſe you may find a ſtraightneſs, oppreſſion, and weight in the Region of the Stomach: And this Sign is laid down for a cleer one by <hi>Eugalenus, Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nertus,</hi> and others.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome ſtories in Authors, of Impoſthumes found in the Pancreas, which were not diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red while the Patients lived. But by the Symptomes they had they may be partly known; as ſome like thoſe of the Scirrhus; to which you may joyn theſe, a lingering Feaver, which is the companion of almoſt all inward Impoſthumes, much watching, ſhort ſleep, and after it, pain, ſwooning, and cold ſweats.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of the Obſtruction, Scirrhus, and Impoſthume of the Pancreas, is the ſame with thoſe of the Liver, Spleen, and Meſentery. There you may fetch Medicines from the Chapters concerning them.</p>

                     <p>BEcauſe the Omentum is a ſoft part and fat, fit by reaſon of its looſneſs to receive Humors that come from other parts: It is ſubject to divers Diſeaſes, as the Meſentery and Pancreas: And theſe are not deſcribed by Authors, becauſe they can ſcare be ſeen in living men, but only by Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy, as you may ſee in ſome Stories in our Obſervations. <hi>Veſalius</hi> ſaith that he ſaw in a Body o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, an Omentum ſo ſwoln that is weighed five pounds, when in its Natural condition it would weigh ſcare half a pound. <hi>Rouſſetus</hi> in <hi>lib. de partu Caeſareo,</hi> reports that in <hi>Paris</hi> there was found a great Impoſthume in the Omentum. <hi>Riolanus</hi> in his Anthropographia, ſaith that he ſaw an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum in a Noble Youth of ninteen yeers of age, ſo full of kernels, by which it received abundance of filthy Humors, the Meſentery and Pancreas being impoſthumated, and the Spleen almoſt conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. We alſo ſaw a Scirrhus Omentum in a Fryar of <hi>Montpelior</hi> all over the lower part of the Belly, and four fingers thick; it was of the color of the Spleen, ſo that it was probable that it was cauſed by Melancholly from thence, becauſe he was of a Melanchollick temper, and the paſſage is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry open by the branches of the Spleen Veins, to the Omentum; by which branches (as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> teacheth, the water in a Dropſie is brought from the Spleen to the Omentum, from which by degrees it diſtils into the Cavity of the Abdomen.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe the ſwelling of the Omentum can by no means be diſtinguiſhed from that of the Meſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, therefore we cannot appoint a diſtinct knowledg. It is true, that the Tumors of the Omentum are eaſier known at the firſt touch, becauſe it is immediately under the Peritonaeum; but the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentery is ſo united to it, and the Muſcles of the lower Belly, that they are ſent forth by ſuppuration through the Navel, or other external parts.</p>
                     <p>Yet this Difficulty of Knowledg, doth not hinder the Cure, becauſe the ſame Medicines ſerve for all Tumors that are alike in all the parts of the belly: but the Cure is worſe to be made in the Omen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, becauſe it hath not fit way, as other parts have for the purging of its ſelf.</p>

                     <p>THat is called <hi>Dolor Nephriticus</hi> which doth afflict the Ureters or Reins; the common people call it the Stone-Chollick, becauſe of the great affinity it hath with the Chollick, ſo that it is hard to diſtinguiſh them, as you ſhall ſee in the Diagnoſtick, or Signs.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſe of this Pain in manifold, but chiefly the ſtone or thick flegm. A ſtone continuing in the Reins, cauſeth either little or no pain, becauſe the ſubſtance of the Reins hath little Sence: but if it fall upon the Head of the Ureters, or get into the paſſage, and diſtend it, and cannot be brought to the Bladder by reaſon of its greatneſs, then it cauſeth grievous pain. But groſs flegm faſtened upon the Ureters, doth diſtend them, and cauſeth the Nephritical pain.</p>
                     <p>The leſs ordinary Cauſes are, thick blood fixed in the Ureters, or thick Matter coming from the Kidneyes, or other parts; ſomtimes wind gets into the Cavity, and cauſeth great pain.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="368" facs="tcp:49088:178"/>There are many Controverſies in Authors about the ſtone, which is the chief and uſual cauſe of the pain of the Reins, which we ſhall not accurately declare, but only touch thoſe things which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to declare its Nature and Cauſes.</p>
                     <p>And firſt, they doubt under what kind of Diſeaſe they ſhould reckon the ſtone; <hi>Galen</hi> placeth it among the Diſeaſes in number, of thoſe things which are wholly beſides Nature, as alſo the Worms. For though a Diſeaſe in number properly doth reſpect living parts, whoſe number being encreaſed or diminiſhed, maketh an organical Diſeaſe; yet thoſe things which are preternaturally added to the number of thoſe things of which the Body is compounded, ought to be referred to the Diſeaſes in number, ſo that ſomtimes the bare qualities are ſomtimes referred to Diſeaſes in number; when they do immediately hurt the actions, as yellowneſs in the Eye of one that hath the Jaundice, a noiſe in the Ears, and a bitter taſt upon the Tongue.</p>
                     <p>Oftentimes the ſtone is reckoned among Cauſes of Diſeaſes, as it breeds Obſtruction or Diſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>It may alſo be placed among the Symptomes, thoſe that are voided or retained: for if it be retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Kidneys, Reins, or Bladder, when it ſhould be voided, it is to be reckoned among thoſe things that are preternaturally retained: but when it is voided, it is to be reckoned among thoſe that are voided wholly againſt Nature.</p>
                     <p>But there is more difficulty about the cauſe of the ſtone, both material and efficient. <hi>Galen</hi> and his poſterity, thought that flegm was the material cauſe of the ſtone, which is thick and ſlimy, fit to be hardened, and (as they ſay of late) faeculent, ſlimy, and Tartarous, and heat the efficient, which drieth and hardeneth that matter, and at length turneth it into a ſtone Which Doctrine is oppoſed with ſtrong Reaſons.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, If it ſhould come of a ſlimy and thick flegm, then it would often be bred in the Brain and the Stomach, in which ſuch flegm doth chiefly abound. Neither will it ſuffice to ſay that there is not ſufficient heat in thoſe parts to harden it; becauſe according to the Doctrine of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> a gentle heat by a continual action is ſufficint to congeal; and hence is the reaſon why old men do more often breed the ſtone, when yong men have hotter Kidneys; becauſe the matter of the ſtone lies longer in old mens Reins, by reaſon of the weakneſs of the expulſive Faculty, and ſo it's longer concocted by the heat, and at length hardened.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, From <hi>Ariſtotle, 2. meteor. cap. 4.</hi> they which grow together by heat, are melted by moiſture, as Clay. But the ſtone is never diſſolved with water. Neither doth it hinder to ſay that a ſtrong heat makes ſuch a Concretion or growing together, that it cannot be diſſolved by moiſture, as in Bricks. For firſt, in Man there is not ſo great a heat; then the not diſſolving of Bricks with Water is not becauſe of the ſtrong heat they had, but rather from the diſpoſition of the Clay; for Clay made of common Earth, although it be baked in a Furnace, wil never be hard as a Brick, but alwaies be diſſolved with moiſture.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, From <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the place mentioned, the heat that makes concretion muſt be dry. But there is a continual flowing of moiſture into the Reins and Bladder, therefore ſuch a drying and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening cannot be in thoſe parts.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Stones bred in Rivers and Fountains, in which there is no heat, and in ſome Dens and Holes that are very cold, the water that fals turns into a ſtone; from whence ſtrange ſhapes do ariſe. Therefore we muſt find another cauſe beſides heat, and another Matter beſides clammy and glutinous Flegm.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Flegm made hard is like Chalk, and is brittle, as you may ſee in the knots of the Joynts. But ſome ſtones are like flints, which they cannot be from Flegm: nor is there ſo much heat in mans Body to make it ſo.</p>
                     <p>This ſlimy flegm hath deceived the Phyſitians of all Ages, which is found in the Urine of many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, and they thought it to be the immediate Cauſe: But they were out. For firſt, In the ſtone of the Kidneys ſuch Urines are ſeldom made, but often in the ſtone of the Bladder. But if this were the matter of the ſtone it would be alike in both. Therefore this Matter depends eſpecially upon the proper Diſeaſe of the Bladder, for it is an Excrement of it diſtempered. The diſeaſe of the Bladder is this: we have ſeen in the Bodies of them who have died of the Stone in the Bladder, and who voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded much of that matter, that the bladder grew fleſhy, as thick as ones finger or thumb, ſo that it fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the whol Cavity, and lay next to the ſtone till by ſtopping the Urine it killed the Patient. But in thoſe who made thin cleer Urine, their bladder was not altered. The Reaſon of theſe accidents are taken out of <hi>Hipp.</hi> Aph. 66. Sect. 5. If there be no Tumor in great and evil wounds, it is evil. And <hi>Galen</hi> gives the Reaſon becauſe there is a ſuſpition that the Humors which ſhould come by reaſon of pain to the wound, are gone to ſome noble part. Moreover, it is Natural to all parts; as <hi>Galen, lib. de diff. febr. cap. 11.</hi> that they which are ſtronger, ſend that which hurteth them to the weaker, nor do they ceaſe ſo doing till it come to the weakeſt. So when the part wounded is very weak, and therefore fit to receive Humors, if they come not thither, it is a ſign that other parts are very weak,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:49088:178"/>
which cannot ſend, and that others are weaker than the wounded, to which the humors are carried. Not only the bad Humors are carried to the wound, but alſo good blood, which Nature ſends to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh it. All theſe things are in the bladder that hath the ſtone. A great uneven ſtone, or ſharp, hurts the Tunicle of the Bladder; hence comes pain and weakneſs. And Nature to help it ſends more than uſual blood, and the ſtronger parts ſend their ſuperfluiteis. Theſe the bladder concocteth as much as may be into its ſelf, and ſo groweth thicker. But when it cannot take in all, eſpecially the evil Humors, hence come many foul Excrements, which from the Nature of the part turn ſo fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick. But in them who have clear Urine, either the ſtone hurteth not, which cauſeth the attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or ſome other parts are weaker than the bladder, to which the humors flow.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe this Doctrine doth deſtroy an old Opinion, we will confirm it by a cleer Example of the Womb. The Womb is Membranous, as the bladder: but in Women with Child it is rleſhy and thick; ſo that in the laſt months it is two fingers thick; becauſe Nature all the time ſends much blood to it to nouriſh the Child; which when the Child doth not wholly conſume, ſome part of it is taken into the Womb: and ſo it encreaſeth. The ſame is in the Bladder, though Preternaturally (which in the Womb is Natural) that when much blood comes to it, it coverts it into its ſelf, and grows thicker. But if without being with Child, the Womb be diſtempered and made weak, then Humors ſuperfluous from other parts come to it, which when they cannot be taken into its ſubſtance, turns to the Whites. And that flux is a proper Excrement of the Womb, as the flegm is of the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. The ſame thing is in the Reins, though not ſo often; as when by a ſtone in them there is pain and weakneſs, Nature ſends much blood and humors to them, which when they cannot be turned into the ſubſtance of the part, they are turned into a ſlimy Excrement, which is voided in abundance; and this vulgar Phyſitians take for Matter or Pus, which is only flegm, or mixed with a little Pus, as when by the grating of the ſtone there is an Ulcer.</p>
                     <p>Some Modern Writers being converted with the aforeſaid Reaſons, have made a Juyce, which will turn into a ſtone to be the material cauſe of the ſtone called <hi>Succus Lapideſcens;</hi> and the efficient to be <hi>Spiritus Lapideſcens.</hi> They call the former a certain Humor naturally proper to turn into a ſtone: And this they deſire to prove by the breeding of ſtones in the Earth, which are by many Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors ſaid to come of Waters and things caſt there into to be hardened preſently; ſome Waters in Caves to be made Stones, and ſome part of the Wine groweth to the Veſſel, called Tartar; and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines that are cleer, when they are cold grow to the glaſs. And although the peculiar fitneſs of the Matter to be thus turned, is not ſufficiently known; yet ſome ſay they have found it out, ſaying that it is of Salt mixed with Earth. Some Salts do grow hard in the Sun, and are eaſily diſſolved in Water; and if they be joyned with Earth like themſelves, by the force of the efficient cauſe they may be ſtones. So we ſee in Wines turned to Tartar: but Tartar calcined goes all into Salt, which ſhews that it is chiefly made of Salt. So in Urines that have much Salt, eſpecially in thoſe which have ſlimy matter, we ſee a tartarous Matter cleaving to the glaſs. This Salt Matter, which is mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Urine, comes from Meat and Drink ſo affected, and they are caſt forth in a ſound Body, nor are they retained in the Reins when the efficient Cauſe is abſent.</p>
                     <p>We have called the efficient Cauſe, <hi>Spiritum Lapidiſicum,</hi> or a Spirit that makes a ſtone: <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> calls it a ſtony diſpoſition, which is in the Reins commonly Haereditarily. But we like the foremoſt Title beſt. For firſt, ſome have ſtones which have them not Haereditarily if they eat or drink things that breed them, becauſe in them there is both the Material and Efficient Cauſe; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Hermets impute the Efficient Cauſe of ſtones to their proper ſeeds, which in a Matter right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpoſed, produce their form.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, Many Hiſtories ſhew that Stones come from a Stone making Spirit, of Men, Beaſts, and other things turned into Stones by a Breath or Spirit out of the Earth. So in <hi>Aventinus,</hi> lib. 7. <hi>Annal. Bavar. an.</hi> 1343. that more than fifty Country men and their Cows, were turned into Stones. And ſo ſaies <hi>Ortellius</hi> in his Deſcription of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> of whol Heards of Cattel. So alſo <hi>Camerarius</hi> reports of a South wind that bloweth ſome times of the yeer, in the Province of <hi>Chilo,</hi> in <hi>Armenia,</hi> by the blaſts whereof, whol Troops of Horſes are ſuddenly turned into Statues of Stone, and ſtand in the ſame rank and file in which they were.</p>
                     <p>This Stone making Spirit, is not only in the Reins of thoſe which have this Diſeaſe, but alſo in the Juyce of thoſe things that are eaten and drunk ſeparated from them; ſo that ſomtimes both come together: Hence it is that ſome that eat but any Meats that incline to the breeding of the ſtone, do preſently produce it, becauſe there is a Stone-breeding diſpoſition, or Stone-making Spirit in their Reins. But if their Reins be free from this Spirit, ſuch meat will not breed ſtones, becauſe their ſtone-making force is not ſtrong enough without the aſſiſtance of the Reins to convert that matter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſtone. On the Contrary, if the ſtone-making power be greater in the meats that are taken, and they are often eaten, ſtones will be bred, although the Kidneys have no ſuch diſpoſition or ſtone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making Spirit. So we ſee in divers places, where the Water or Wine are full of ſtone-making juyce,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:49088:179"/>
the greateſt part of the Inhabitants are ſubject to the ſtone; as we may ſee in <hi>Ovid</hi> concerning the Thracians, in theſe Verſes:</p>
                     <q>
                        <lg>
                           <l>The Thracian Waters, all things Marble make,</l>
                           <l>Their Guts turn Stone that inwardly them take.</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q>
                     <p>And contrary, If there be that ſtone-making vertue in the Kidneys, it makes ſtones of any nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though never ſo wholſom. So about three yeers ſince, I ſaw one who for three or four months voided more than twelve little ſtones every day by Urine, when all that while he kept his bed, very ſick, and fed only upon Broth and Panadoes.</p>
                     <p>The Antecedent and Primary Cauſes, either reſpect the ſupply of Matter for the ſtone, or the conſtitution of the Reins, by reaſon whereof the ſtones do more eaſily grow.</p>
                     <p>The Stomach, Liver, Spleen, and Reins, do much cauſe the breeding and heaping up of Matter for the ſtone; chiefly the Stomach, if it do not wel concoct, there is a crude Chyle brought to the Liver; and from thence impure and Earthy Juyces are ſent with the Serum or Water into the Reins. A hot liver doth bake the Chylous Matter, and makes it fit to breed a ſtone; as alſo being too cold it makes crude blood moſt fit for the ſame purpoſe. A Spleen weak or ſtopped, or otherwiſe diſturbed, doth not ſufficiently purge the droſſie part of the blood, but ſends part of it to the Reins, which will more eaſily be turned into a ſtone. And laſtly, the Reins beſides their conjunct cauſe, which is a ſtony diſpoſition, are an Antecedent Cauſe in two reſpects; namely, in reſpect of their Temper, and of their Form. In regard of their hot Temper, they more violently draw the Stone-making Matter, and thicken it more: but in reſpect of their Form, they are an Antecedent Cauſe, if the Emulgent Veins are more looſe, ſo that that thick and Tartarous Matter may be more eaſily received into the Reins; or if the Ureters, and thoſe Veſſels that ſend the ſerous Matter to them, be too narrow, ſo that the thick Matter hath not a free paſſage, but is retained in the Reins.</p>
                     <p>Thick and ſlimy Nouriſhment doth chiefly afford Matter for the Stone, ſuch as are full of Salt, as Beef, Pork, Hairs, Geeſe, or things dried in the Smoak, or poudered, as Salt-fiſh, Shel-fiſh, Eeles, Pulſe, Cheeſ, and all Milk meats, hard Eggs, Cheſnuts, Pears, Quinces, Medlars, unleavened Bread, and Rice; thick Wine, ſharp or black, or new Wine not purged, ſtanding Waters, and ſuch as are full of ſtone-breeding Juyce.</p>
                     <p>To theſe add very hot Meats, as Pepper, Ginger, Garlick, Onions, old ſtrong Wine, which makes the Liver and Reins too hot, too ſtrong Diureticks, which carry the Matter that will cauſe the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe too violently to the Reins; thick Garments, Down Beds, Baths, inordinate Lechery, which is a great Enemy to the Reins, violent Exercue, eſpecially after meat, too much feeding, or long fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, great anger, and other paſſions.</p>
                     <p>The Signs of the Stone taken by themſelves, are equivocal, and common to other Diſeaſes: but if you conſider them all together, you may have certain Knowledg by them.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt Sign, is a fixed pain about the Loyns, ſomtimes heavy when the Stone is faſtened to the ſubſtance; which being of a dull ſence, hath a weighty pain; but as often as the Stone gets into the Head of the Ureters, then it cauſeth a ſharp and pricking pain, and this is called the Nephritical pain, or pain of the Reins, and it continueth while the ſtone is there; neither will it ceaſe to torment the Patient till the ſtone get into the Cavity of the Bladder, or turn back into the hollow of the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes.</p>
                     <p>The Second Sign, is bloody Urine, which comes from the opening or corroſion of the Veins which are diſperſed into the ſubſtance of the Reins, which comes from the rubbing of the Stone that ſticks in the ſubſtance; but if there be but little blood voided, being mixed with Urine it looſeth its color, ſo that the Urine looks like a Lye. This Sign is not alwaies, but ſomtimes depends upon other cauſes. But when it doth appear, it is one of the chief, which diſtinguiſheth the Stone from the Chollick. It uſeth to be cauſed by riding, much walking, and other violent exerciſe; for then the ſtone if it be rough and ſnaggy, being removed from its place, doth cut and tear the tender Fleſh of the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes.</p>
                     <p>The Third Sign, is thin Urine, water-like, and little, in the beginning of the fit; after which ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times followeth a total ſtoppage, if both Ureters are ſtopped: but when the fit is paſt, and the ſtone that was fixed in the Ureters is fallen into the bladder, there comes forth much thick troubled Urine, with a ſandy Sediment.</p>
                     <p>The Fourth Sign, is often voiding of ſand and ſtones. Concerning voiding of a ſtone, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, That if the Patient voided any formerly, though never ſo ſmal, when he had a fit, it is moſt certain that the Diſeaſe is the Stone. But concerning Sand we cannot ſpeak ſo infallible; for we may ſee many all their lives time void Gravel, and never be troubled with the ſtone; for ſand comes often from aduſtion of Humors in the Liver and Veins, and it ſticks to the ſides of the Urinal, and goes not to the bottom, as that which comes from the Reins. Beſides, if you rub it between your fingers, it diſſolveth, and is like Salt, when the other will not yeeld to the fingers, and will not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve. And finally, becauſe this Sand is ſalt, it is diſſolved in hot Urine, nor will it appear while the
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:49088:179"/>
Urine is ſo; but when it is cold it grows together to the ſides of the Urinal, not unlike the Cryſtal of Tartar; which being diſſolved in warm water, when it grows cold, congealeth and ſticks to the ſides of the Glaſs; ſo the Nature of them both is very like.</p>
                     <p>The Fifth Sign, is a ſtone voided, and this is moſt certain: For if any former Sign, though equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal do appear, and a ſtone be voided, you may be certain of the Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>The Sixth Sign, is a numbneſs of the Thigh on the ſame ſide that the Back is pained of: for the ſtone being great, doth oppreſs the Nerve which is in erted into the Muſcles of the Loyns, under the Reins, called by the Anatomiſts <hi>Pſenas,</hi> and thoſe Muſcles go to the Hip for its motion ſuch a numb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is perc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ived by ſitting upon the Thigh, through the compreſſion; or in the Arm by long leaning thereon.</p>
                     <p>The Seventh Sign, is the drawing in of one ſtone, on that ſide where the pain is: For the Kidneys and Ureters being provoked with the greatneſs of the pain, do vehemently contract themſelves, and then the Spermatical Veſſels and all the parts adjacent are alſo contracted, and theſe Veſſels do raiſe up the ſtone which is joyned to them, ſo that it ſeems ſomtimes to be fixed to the Groyn. And this retraction or drawing in of parts reacheth to the bladder and Guts: For in great pain the belly is bound, and Urine ſtopped; ſo that then Purges will not work by reaſon they are hindered by that Contraction.</p>
                     <p>The Eighth Sign is, loathing and vomiting by the connexion of the Kidneys with the Stomach, by the Membrane that comes from the Peritonaeum, and by the Nerve of the ſixth Conjugation, two branches whereof reach from the Stomach to the inward Tunicle of the Kidneys. Therefore when thoſe ſenſible parts in the Kidneys are pulled, the Stomach conſenting, is ſtirred up to exclude that which hurteth; and firſt it ſends out Flegm, then yellow Choller, after green, if the evil continue, becauſe through long pain and watching the blood is altered in the Veins, and that part which is moſt diſpoſed for it, is turned into green Choller.</p>
                     <p>Finally, The Nephritical pain is ſo like the Chollick, that <hi>Galen</hi> himſelf was deceived in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing of them, as we ſhewed in the Diagnoſis or Knowldg of the Chollick: where alſo we laid down ſigns by which we may diſtinguiſh them, which we ſhall not need to repeat.</p>
                     <p>The Signs afore mentioned are equivocal, and one of them can ſcarce give a certain knowledg. Some Authors mention others, which are more equivocal and uncertain, but joyned with others they help the knowledg of the Diſeaſe, therefore it will not be amiſs to mention them.</p>

                        <hi>Hipp.</hi> Aph. 34. Sect. 7. ſaith, <hi>They who have bubbles in their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine, have an old Diſeaſe in the Reins.</hi> For theſe bubbles come from thick Humors full of groſs vapors, which are either bred in the Reins, or ſent from other parts to them, that matter is proper to breed the ſtone, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be preſently cured, therefore the Diſeaſe is long. <hi>Galen</hi> in his Comment upon this Aporiſm, ſaith that the mouthes of the Arteries which come to the Reins, are opened by the ſharpneſs of the Urine, and thence comes a Spirit which being mixed with the Urine, maketh bubbles. But it is not probable that ſuch a groſs Spirit that will remain ſo long, ſhould come from the Arteries, and Urine being cold may long time ſo continue, as we ſee many bubbles many hours ſwimming thereupon. And alſo when the Arteries are opened by the ſharpneſs of the Urine, blood will alſo come forth. And the mouthes of the Veins having thin Skins, would be more eaſily opened, and ſo there would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo blood mixed with the bubbles.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hippocrates</hi> alſo Aph. 76. Sect. 4. ſaith, <hi>They who void little bits of fleſh, and things like hairs, with a thick <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine, do it from the Reins.</hi> The bits of fleſh come from the Ulcer of the Reins, of which we ſhall ſpeak hereafter: but theſe thrids or hairs are ſaid by <hi>Galen,</hi> in his Commentaries, to come from thick and crude flegm, made long and round by the extraordinary heat of the Reins. Yet <hi>Galen</hi> confeſſeth, 6. loc. aff. cap. 3. that after a long ſearch he was ignorant of the cauſe of their length. <hi>Avicen</hi> ſaith that theſe thrids grow long in the veſſels of the Reins, or others; for in regard theſe are taken away by Diureticks, and the Patients acknowledg pain in the Reins, it is credible that they receive their form from thence. <hi>Actuarius</hi> doth directly ſay they come from the Ureters: For when the Reins abound with flegm, it goes with the Urine into the Ureters, and ſticking to them and growing thick by heat, it gets a long ſhape like a thrid or hair. But <hi>Fernelius</hi> writes that thoſe hairs come from the Paraſtatis or kernels, from his Obſervation, in which they grow long like hairs from the matter of the ſeed, which by force of the Diſeaſe flowing down by degrees, grows thick by heat, and that they appear much in thoſe who have lately had a filthy Gonorrhoea, and in thoſe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who have the Whites, or a foul Womb, and in that Urine which they make next after they have known a man. Others ſuppoſe, that thoſe thick Humors of which thoſe filaments or hairs are made, are firſt bred in the Veins, but take their form in the narrow paſſages of the Reins, through which, as through a ſieve, they turn ſmal, and after they deſcend into the Ureters, in which they grow dryer, till they are ſent into the bladder, neither can they be broken by reaſon of their toughneſs. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the cauſe is, ſince the beſt Authors do agree that theſe hairs breed of thick flegm in the Kidneys,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:49088:180"/>
or come to them from other parts, it is certain that they may turn into a ſtone, if there be an efficient cauſe fit to produce it. And therefore this may be a probable ſign of the ſtone.</p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſtick. The ſtone of the Kidneys is very dangerous, for it uſeth to bring great evils; as Inflamation, Exulceration, great Pains, Watchings, dejection of ſtrength, Feavers, ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings of Urine, and the like dangerous Symptomes.</p>
                     <p>If this Diſeaſe be Haereditary coming from the Parents, it is incurable.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith that the Diſeaſes of the Reins are hard to be cured in oldmen, Aph. 6. Sect. 6. The Stone of the Kidneyes in old men is difficult, if not incurable.</p>
                     <p>If the pain of the Kidneys continue many daies, and cannot be cured with any Medicines, there is danger of death, and it is neer at hand when they are cold externally, and have a cold ſweat in the face. Urines that are firſt thin, and after thick, and have ſand at the bottom, do ſignifie that the fit is towards an end.</p>
                     <p>A Stone joyned with an Ulcer in the Kidneys, is incurable: for thoſe things which break the Stone, do exaſperate the Ulcer.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of the pain of the Kidneys, and ſtone ſticking in them, or in the Ureters, is by enlarging of the paſſages, and relaxing them by throwing forth the ſtone, and any other thing that hurts them, by removing or taking away the antecedent cauſe, and by taking away the pain. Which you may do with theſe Medicines.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Marſh-mallow and Lilly Roots, of each one ounce: Mallows, Violets, Pellitory, Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot, of each one handful: Lin-ſeed and Fenugreek ſeed, of each half an ounce: fat Figgs, ſix: Chamomel and Melilot Flowers, of each one pugil: boyl them to a pint. Diſſolve in the ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Caſſia, and Diacatholicon, of each ſix drams: Oyl of Lillies and Violets, of each one ounce and an half: freſh Oyl two ounces: make a Clyſter to be given preſently.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Afterwards open the Liver Vein of the right or left Arm, and take away eight or nine ounces of blood, according to the ſtrength and fulneſs of the Patient. Phlebotomy is very neceſſary to prevent Inſlamation, which uſeth to come from continuance of pain.</p>
                     <p>After blood-letting, give this Clyſter.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the flowers of Chamomel and Melilot, the tops of Dill, Pellitory of the wall and Rue, of each half a bandful: Annis, Fennel, and Cummin ſeeds, of each half an ounce: Make a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cootion to one pint; in which diſſolve Diaphoenicon half an ounce: Turpentine diſſolved with the Yolk of an Egg one ounce: Oyl of Dill and Scorpions, of each three ounces.

                     </p>
                     <p>To mollifie more, and aſſwage the pain after your Laxative, you may make one of Oyl thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Oyl of Dill and of Chamomel, of each half a pound: Oyl of ſweet Almonds two ounces: Oyl of Rue one ounce: mix them for a Clyſter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At the ſame time appply a Fomentation to the part pained, made of the Decoction of the firſt Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, with Annis ſeeds and Fennel ſeeds, Oyl and Water, with Spunges.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Oyl of Scorpions compounded two ounces: freſh Butter, Hens Greaſe, Oyl of Lillies, and of ſweet Almonds, of each one ounce. Make a Liniment to be uſed after the Fomenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

                     <p>Or this Cataplaſin:</p>

Make a Cataplaſin, which you muſt put between two thin linnen cloaths, and apply warm to the Belly, according to the length of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>reters, and heat it as often as it grows cold.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You may alſo apply one either made of Pellitory alone, or with Eggs fryed in a Pan with Oyl of Chamomel, bitter Almonds, Scorpions in a cloth.</p>
                     <p>Or make it of Onions ſhred and fryed with Hogs Greaſe, or the Oyls aforeſaid, with five or ſix warm Eggs applied.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe in this Diſeaſe, there is abundance of crude Humors, after Clyſters (which muſt ſtill be repeated as the pain cometh) you may give a purging Medicine, eſpecially in form of a Bolus, leſt it be eaſily vomited up, becauſe theſe Patients are commonly ſqueazy ſtomached.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Caſſia new drawn with Oyl of ſweet Almonds one ounce: Diaphoenicon three drams: Pouder of Rhubarb one dram: with the pouder of Liquorin and Tragacanth, make a Bolus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the Patient cannot ſwallow a Bolus, diſſolve purging things in the Decoction of Mallows.</p>
                     <p>But you muſt diligently obſerve that you muſt not give a Purging Medicine before the pain be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed. For when the pain is great, a ſtrong Purge ſeldom works, becauſe then all the parts contract themſelves, and refuſe to help the Medicine.</p>
                     <p>But at that time you may give a Vomit, by which the plenty of Humors may be abated, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion is made from the part affected; and often Nature of the ſelf, when the pain is urgent, doth endeavor the ſame, and after it finds eaſe.</p>

                        <pb n="373" facs="tcp:49088:180"/>A gentle Vomit which will alſo aſſwage pain, may be made thus:</p>

                     <p>The day after you have opened the Arm, you may open the Ham or Ancle Vein on the ſame ſide, for that will derive the Humor, and the Patients find much eaſe thereby. Which Rule is given us by <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> 6. Epid. Part. I. Aph. 6. and by <hi>Aetius,</hi> lib. 11. cap. 5.</p>
                     <p>And if the Diſeaſe laſt long, you may open the Hemorroids; according to <hi>Hipp.</hi> Aph. 11. Sect. 6. who ſaith, That it is good for Melanchollick men, and ſuch as have the ſtone, to have their Hemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoids bleed. From the ſame branch of the Spleen there are Veins which go to the Reins, bladder, and Hemorrhoids.</p>
                     <p>If the pain be not aſſwaged by Fomentations, Liniments, and Cataplaſms aforeſaid, put him into a Bath made of the Emollent Decoction, with white Wine added, for it aſſwageth pain, at leaſt while the Patient ſits therein; but you muſt not uſe it much leaſt it take away ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly, When the pain is very great with watching and weakneſs, you muſt give Narcoticks, and put two drams of Philonium Romanum, or five or ſix grains of Laudanum in a Clyſter, or three or four grains at the mouth, or one ounce of Syrup of Poppies in a convenient Julep.</p>
                     <p>After theſe Topicks have been uſed, in a long pain, it is good to apply a Plaiſter of Melilot, malax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Oyl of Chamomel and Dill.</p>
                     <p>This pain uſeth to be bred with ſome of theſe Medicines, and with repeating Purges (if they be needful) or giving Caſſia often. But if after the uſe of them it continue, it is moſt certain that they are great ſtones which ſtop the Ureters, which muſt be ſent out by Diureticks, which wil break them. But you muſt firſt begin with the mildeſt, leſt by ſtrong and ſharp you inflame the Blood and the Reins. And you muſt conſider the habit of the Body: For a full Body will endure things that do more pierce and make thin; but a ſlender, leſs.</p>
                     <p>There are abundance of this kind in Authors, that diminiſh, break, and expel the ſtone, but we wil give you only the moſt choyce.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>You may ſooner make a Julep of Saxifrage Water, and Syrup of Violets, with fifteen or twenty drops of Spirit of Vitriol.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Concerning Juyce of Lemmons you muſt note, That it muſt be uſed warily, for being given of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and much, it maketh Exulcerations in the Stomach, from whence cometh the Flux called <hi>Lienteria.</hi>

                     <p>The Aſhes of burnt Egg-ſhels from half a dram to an ounce given in white Wine, doth powerfully expel the Stone that ſticks in the paſſages of the Ureters.</p>
                     <p>Goats blood prepared is commended of all Authors, old and modern, as the beſt Medicine to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the ſtone. The Doſe is from half a dram to a dram.</p>
                     <p>The Water of Goats Blood diſtilled in a Glaſs in Balneo Mariae, doth wonders. But you muſt feed the Goat one month with Saxifrage, burnt Juniper berries, Parſley, and other Diureticks, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Drink.</p>

                        <hi>Hartman</hi> commends the Urine of a Goat in theſe words as a wonderful Remedy: <hi>In the ſtoppage of the Reins by a greatſtone, or when the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>reters and Bladder are ſtopped by ſtones ſent thither, ſo that one drop cannot be voided, it is excellent if you take the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine of a Goat taken out with his Bladder while he is yet alive, and drink and apply his Paunch and Guts to the Belly and Privities, for ſo the ſtone will be preſently conſumed without hurt to the Veſſels, and the Patient cured.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Pouder of Millepedum, or Sows, is excellent to diſſolve the ſtone, and we will teach the uſe thereof in the ſtone of the Bladder.</p>

The Chymiſts brag much of their Salts: among which the beſt is, Salt of Bean Cods, or Stalks, half a dram whereof, with white Wine works very well.

                     <p>And firſt, if there be a Plethora or fulneſs, or the Reins and Liver hot, it is good to open a Vein, Spring and Fall, a Clyſter or gentle Purge being firſt given: And then to purge the Matter away which is proper to breed the ſtone before it come to the Kidneys, which you may do by a Vomit twice or thrice in a month, to thoſe which eaſily vomit.</p>

And the reaſon why Turpentine often uſed doth not hurt as other Diureticks, in my Judgment is this; Becauſe it looſeneth the Belly withal; ſo that thoſe groſs Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, which by other Medicines would be carried to the Reins, are ſent out by ſtool.</p>
                     <p>But commonly Turpentine is uſed ſeldom, as other Diureticks, either alone, or with other Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, thus:</p>

But when we fear the Inflamation of the Guts, we ordered them to abſtain from Wine, and gave them Chicken Broth with cold Herbs and Juleps. Therefore we put fat Flegmatick men into them once a day in the morning, having firſt anointed their Reins and Liver with ſome proper Oyntment, and bound them with doubled linnen cloaths, that the Excrements might be received from the Pores o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.

                     <p>ALthough we ſhould ſpeak of theſe Diſeaſes of the Reins in order, yet becauſe the Stone in the Kidneys and Bladder a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e of the ſame Nature, and what hath been ſaid of the one, may agree with the other, we ſhal ſpeak next of the Stone in the Bladder.</p>
                     <p>The Material and Efficient Cauſe is the ſame of both: only this Difference there is; That Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are moſt ſubject to the Stone in the Bladder, and Men to that in the Kidneys. The Reaſon of which, is given by <hi>Galen,</hi> 6. Epid. Sect. 3. becauſe thickneſs of Urine, which Children often have by Reaſon of their gluttony, is diſſolved by their gentle heat; neither doth it ſtay in the Reins by the help of the Expulſive Faculty of the Reins, which is ſtronger in that age; but being fallen into the Bladder, there it ſtaies longer, becauſe children given to play and ſleep, piſs more ſeldom. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, their Urine is not ſo ſharp, neither doth it provoke the expulſive faculty of the Bladder, while the quantity is burdenſom, and ſo the dregs remain becauſe the Paſſage is very narrow; beſides, the bladder being ſtretched by the plenty of Urine cannot ſo exactly contract it ſelf to empty out all the Urine, but ſome remains in the bottom, which is thick, and fit to breed the Stone. On the contrary, old men do often piſs forth that Matter which is in the bladder, and their paſſage is larger; but the thick humor remains in the Reins, becauſe it is clammy, and cannot be diſſolved by their weak heat, or ſtrain through by reaſon of its dryneſs. Hence <hi>Hippocrates in Coacis,</hi> ſaith that the Stone in the bladder is not bred after fourteen yeers of age, to three ſcore, except it was there before.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fernelius</hi> mentioned a new Opinion of the Stone, breeding in the Bladder, ſaying, That every ſtone in the bladder, had its beginning from the Kidneys, and grows afterwards in the bladder: For when in a fit of the ſtone, it fals from the Reins, if it be great, it ſtaies in the Bladder, and by getting new Matter it encreaſeth by degrees. For he affirmeth that in grinding of ſome ſtones taken out of the Bladder, he found as it were a Kernel which fel from the Reins of another color and ſubſtance, and that he never knew any that had a ſtone in the bladder, who was not formerly vexed with pains in the Reins. But this Opinion is caſt off by divers very good Authors, who by their Experience have found the contrary, and have taken many ſtones from the bladders of children, which have been wholly of the ſame color and ſubſtance within. And common Experience teacheth us, that Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren have the Stone in the Bladder, who never had pain in the Reins, which would be otherwiſe if the ſtone came firſt from the Reins. It is true, that in men many times ſtones fall from the Kidneys into the Bladder, and encreaſe by the addition of new Matter; but we deny that it is alwaies ſo, and we conſtantly affirm, that many ſtones have taken their beginning in the bladder.</p>
                     <p>The knowledg of the ſtone in the bladder is difficult, eſpecially in the beginning, when it is little; but when it is great it is evident. But we ſhall diſcover it as much as we can by Art.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt Sign is, pain in the neck of the bladder, which is worſe towards the end of piſſing, and reacheth to the end of the Yard, like that which is in difficulty of Urine from Inflamation, called <hi>Dyſuria,</hi> and it is ſcarcely at firſt diſtinguiſhed from it, but when other ſigns appear.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:49088:184"/>
                        <pb facs="tcp:49088:185"/>
                        <pb n="379" facs="tcp:49088:185"/>
The Second Sign is, Itching in the Yard, which makes the Patient ſcratch it often.</p>
                     <p>The Third Sign is, Weight in the Peritonaeum, or inward covering of the Guts, and all about the Pecten where the Hair groweth, with a heavy pain, when the ſtone is great.</p>
                     <p>The Fourth Sign is, When there is a great ſtone there is great ſtoppage of Urine, with pain like women in travel, and dropping of water, and often endeavoring to pils.</p>
                     <p>The Fifth Sign is, Stoppage ſuddenly in time of piſſing, by reaſon of the ſtone falling to the Orifice of the Bladder.</p>
                     <p>The Sixth Sign is, Eaſier making Water lying upon the back, becauſe it puts the ſtone from the Orifice to the bottom of the bladder.</p>
                     <p>The Seventh Sign is, Often ſtanding of the Yard, which comes from ſtoppage of Urine, and of the Inflamation of the bladder by the ſtone rubbing againſt it.</p>
                     <p>The Eighth is, An often deſire to go to ſtool, which follows the deſire of piſſing, by reaſon of the conſent of the Sphincter Muſcles of the Anus and Bladder; for when one is provoked, the other is provoked, becauſe they have branches from the ſame Nerve.</p>
                     <p>The Ninth is, The Patient cannot reſt in a place, but ſhakes his Leggs, and if the ſtone be great he can ſcarce ſtand upright, ride, or walk in rough places; for then the mouth of the bladder is much afflicted with the ſtone.</p>
                     <p>The Tenth is, That the Patient is helped by no Remedy, but worſe commonly; for all Medicines that go through the paſſages of the Urine, either do bring new matter, and encreaſe the evil, or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry away the flegm, which being about the ſtone made it leſs offenſive, but being bare, doth grate the inward Tunicle of the bladder.</p>
                     <p>The Eleventh Sign is, When the Patient is in pain of the Reins, and after a fit uſeth to void ſtones which cauſed it, but now voideth none as formerly, it is a ſign that the ſtone cauſing the pain is ſent to the bladder, and there remains, where by degrees it encreaſeth, and cauſeth the aforeſaid Symptomes. Therefore if any after ſuch pain, voids no ſtone, and after a time begins to be ſtopped from making urine, it is very probable that there is a ſtone in the bladder.</p>
                     <p>The Twelfth Sign is from <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> Aph. 79. Sect. 4. <hi>They who make a ſandy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine have a ſtone in the Bladder.</hi> Which Aphoriſm hath troubled many Wits. <hi>Galen</hi> in his Commentary thereupon, ſaith, that it is manifeſtly lame, and defective, becauſe <hi>Hippocrates</hi> left out half of it; for whether the ſtone be in the Kidneys or Bladder alwaies the Urin is ſandy. And <hi>Hippocrates</hi> himſelf contradicts this Aphoriſm, <hi>Lib. de internis Affectionibus,</hi> where he reproveth the old Phyſitians that ſuppoſed ſand in the Urine to be the ſign of the Stone in the Bladder. <hi>Cardanus</hi> in his Comment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame Aphoriſm, ſaith, That he voided for thirty yeers, firſt red, then white ſand, every day in abundance without any ſuſpicion of the ſtone either of the Kidneys or Bladder; and he further ſaith, that there are ſcarce one in ten who doth not void Gravel, yet few there are that are troubled with the ſtone in the Kidneys, and fewer with that in the bladder. The Spaniards void much Gravel, and yet are not ſubject to the ſtone.</p>
                     <p>We diſtinguiſhed of ſand in the former Chapter, which may ſignifie the ſtone: But we ſaid it was an equivocal ſign. For that ſand is ſomtimes ſent forth by the ſtrength of the expulſive faculty, and is not kept in the Kidneys and Bladder any while. And if this ſand did ſhew the ſtone more ſurely, yet it would never declare that of the Bladder only. And therefore that Aphoriſm, as the words are is falſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Beverovitius</hi> and <hi>Salmaſius,</hi> have greatly contended about this Aphoriſm (both Learned men) and good to open dark Sentences) and they have written both whol Volums of the ſame. It is not our intention to ſtay long upon it, determining this one thing for an end of all Controverſies; That the Opinions of Authors, which at firſt ſeem contrary to Truth and dayly Experience, are alwaies to be taken in that ſence which is moſt conformable to Truth, although the words will not bear it, which in ſuch a caſe are to be thought to be added by ſimple fellows in the Tranſlation, or the whol Sentence to be put in by them; as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith often of ſome of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his Sayings, That they are thruſt in by others, when they carry not the weight and Majeſty of <hi>Hippocrates.</hi> And the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of <hi>Beverovitius</hi> concerning ſand in the Urine, ſeems not to be according to the mind of <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,</hi> nor to be of great uſe in Practice. Firſt, it ſeems not to agree with <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> who in his foregoing Aphoriſms, takes ſigns from things contained in the Urine; and following his matter in hand, ſaith, That Sand in the Urine, ſignifieth the ſtone of the Bladder. But <hi>Beverovitius</hi> inverts the Sence, and ſaith that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> is to be underſtood of Sand, which formerly uſed to be voided, that if they ſubſiſt, that is, be retained in the Bladder, and be no more ſent forth, it is a ſign that the Sand ſo retained is turned to a ſtone in the bladder. This Interpretation, as I ſaid, doth agree with <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his Intention, and it nothing avails for Practice: for they who uſe to void gravel, have ſome time of intermiſſion, in which there is not a ſtone bred in the Bladder. Nor hath it much weight that <hi>Beverovitius</hi> obſerveth, That <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his other Aphoriſms, where he laies down the ſigns to be taken from the things contained in the Urine, doth not uſe the word <hi>Subſidentia,</hi> or ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

or falling down; but the Word Excretion, or voiding. As for example, they who piſs matter or blood, with thick and branny Urine, &amp;c. But here he uſeth the word that ſignifieth ſetling, to ſhew that he meaneth ſomthing elſe. But we bringing all things to Practice, ſay that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in this Aphoriſm, could not uſe a word which ſignifieth only ſending forth, or Excretion becauſe he ought to diſtinguiſhe that ſand which ſignifieth the Stone, from that which doth not. This Sand as we ſaid in the former Chapter, ſettles in the bottom of the Urinal; but other Sand doth only ſtick to the ſides; and therefore <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> that he might diſtinguiſh them, ſaid well. They whoſe ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy matter ſettleth; for others which do not ſettle, are not a ſign of the ſtone in the bladder.</p>
                     <p>But that we may bring this Aphoriſm to Truth, and Practical uſe, we ſuppoſe that the Opinion of <hi>Johannes Zechius,</hi> is the beſt; who makes it a proper ſign of the ſtone of the bladder, and there is great uſe of the Aphoriſm in Phyſical Practice, when by al other Interpreters, it is made unprofitable. And that <hi>Zechius</hi> may be honored by them who have not his Works, we think it work our labor to repeat his words, which are in his Book of Conſultation, 58. Conſult. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Aph. 79. Sect. 4. ſaid thus, which was never underſtood yet, either by</hi> Galen, <hi>or any other. They whoſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine hath a ſandy ſettling or ſediment, have the ſtone in the bladder. Which Sentence, if we ſhould take it according to</hi> Galen, <hi>woudl be falſe, becauſe we obſerve that many men do piſs ſand all their lives (whereof I am one) without any ſuſpicion of the ſtone in the bladder. From whence I cannot but wonder at</hi> Galen, <hi>and all the reſt after him, that they ſhould either not underſtand ſo uſeful an Aphoriſm (which I can ſcarce beleeve) or by reaſon of its ambiguity paſs it by. The whol difficulty is in the ſignification of the word</hi> [Sabuloſa] <hi>in Greek called Pſammodea:</hi> Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates <hi>would have nothing underſtood thereby but thick gravel mixed as it were with fat Earth like Clay or ſnot in the bottom of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rinal; a certain ſign of a great ſtone in the bladder. But becauſe there is nothing conſtant in man, it is not to be admired that ſome that have this Diſeaſe have not this ſign; as when the ſtone is ſmal, as we obſerved m Cardinal</hi> Paleotus. <hi>Now the cauſe of this muddy Excrement hath ſhewed in another place.</hi> So far <hi>Zechius;</hi> but where he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the cauſe of it we could never find. But we plainly ſhewed it in former Chapter, when we ſaid that this ſnot-like matter is the proper Excrement of the bladder diſtempered, when it cannot concoct the great quantity of blood, and ſuperfluous humors which are ſent thither, and turn them into its ſelf, but turns them into that conſiſtence like ſnot; and this evil diſpoſition of the bladder comes from the ſtone therein. Let that be peruſed, for it maketh much for the underſtanding of what hath been ſaid.</p>
                     <p>But there ſtill remaineth one difficulty, for ſome have dayly flegmatick, ſlimy matter in their Urine, and yet are free from the ſtone in the bladder. And <hi>Cardanus</hi> reports of an Auguſtine Monk called <hi>Leo,</hi> that ſhewed him often ſo much congealed flegm in the bottom of the Chamber pot as was bigger than a Gooſe Egg, and yet he had not the Stone. To this doubt we anſwer, That the ſlimy matter that comes from the bladder, is to be diſtinguiſhed from that which comes from other parts, becauſe that which comes from the bladder, is more clammy and glutinous, ſo that it ſticks faſt to the bottom of the Pot or Urinal, and cannot be ſhaken off when the Urine is powred forth; but that which is from other parts doth ſo cleave, but comes preſently forth with the Urine; Experience hath taught me this, which hiterto no Author ever yet obſerved. This clammineſs comes from the Nature of the Bladder, which is a Membrane, and apt to produce this glewineſs, as you may ſee Glew is made of Membranous Skins of Beaſts.</p>
                     <p>This tough glutinous Matter, I ſay, comes from the evil diſpoſition of the bladder, which is cauſed by the ſtone there, and we can thus prove it beſides what hath been ſaid; Becauſe we have known a Child twelve yeers old, that had a ſtone in the Bladder, and piſſed continually a glutinous matter that cleaved to the bottom of the Glaſs. And after the ſtone was cut forth, he voided the ſame for a month, but afterwards none at all. Which cleerly ſhews that that Matter comes from the evil diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Bladder, which could not preſently be cured after the Bladder was cured, that matter appeared no more, which ſhews that it came from no other part but the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                     <p>For a Concluſion of this, let us take notice, That whenſoever this ſlimy matter appears with all the aforeſaid conditions, there is a ſtone in the Bladder; but when it doth not appear, it doth not follow that there is no ſtone, for it often happeneth that the ſtone is ſmooth, or little, and ſo doth not hurt the bladder, and then the Urine is alwaies cleer. This is a true ſign, that there is a ſtone when it appears; but when it is abſent, it is not a ſign of no ſtone.</p>
                     <p>Nor would this Objection, or rather Cavil, become a wiſe man, becauſe from our Obſervation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, we proved that ſuch matter might be voided by Urine, and yet no ſtone in the bladder, for it was cut forth. It is ſufficient that either a Stone was lately there, which was the cauſe of this Diſeaſe; and ſo this kind of Matter ſignifieth, either a Stone there now, or lately hath been there.</p>
                     <p>The laſt ſign is by tryal with the Catheter, and putting the finger into the Anus, which operation
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:49088:186"/>
muſt be uſed to take away all doubt; for the moſt part it doth: for ſomtimes the Stone is covered with ſlimy matter, ſo that the Cutters themſelves are deceived thereby. But the Catheter is more uncertain than the finger, by which you may not be certain of the Stones being there, but of the form and bigneſs of it.</p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſtick of this Diſeaſe: It is alwaies painful and dangerous; painful, becauſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly very ſmal ſtones can paſs through the Neck of the Bladder.</p>
                     <p>The great ones, if like flint, cannot be diſſolved; if ſoft like Chalk, or brittle, they may be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with long uſe of powerful Medicines, which for the moſt part the Patients wil not ſtick to, and therefore they are ſeldom cured; therefore there is often cutting, which how terrible it is, dayly Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience wil declare, becauſe many die under the Operation. Hence <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his Oath, commands his Diſciples that they uſe it not, but leave it to men of that Profeſſion only. But in Women, the Operation is leſs dangerous, becauſe their Paſſage for Urine is wider, and it may be done without cutting, only by enlarging the part.</p>
                     <p>The way of Cure is the ſame with that of the Kidneys, firſt Evacuation of the antecedent matter, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion, and hindering of the breeding of it: and let the Matter conjunct, or the Stone it ſelf, be dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, worn away, or diſſolved; for which there are good Medicines in the Chapter aforegoing.</p>
                     <p>Of which, the diſtilled Water of Onions is moſt excellent, by which continued twenty daies we ſaw a ſtone bigger than a Bean thrown out of the Bladder.</p>
                     <p>But the beſt Authors and Experience teach, That things taken at the mouth cannot diſſolve the Stone in the Bladder. Hence it is that we commonly refer them to the Cutter. But becauſe there are many ſtories of men cured by ſuch Medicines, we wil ſpeak of the chief, that every one may try them, if he pleaſe, before he go to the terrible Chyrurgion. Somtimes the Stone is ſo ſoft and newly congealed that it is not impoſſible to diſſolve it; but hard flinty ſtones cannot.</p>

                        <hi>Horatius Augenius,</hi> Tom. 2. Epiſt. Med. Lib. 9. Epiſt. 8. <hi>I</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>have twice ſeen the ſtone broken in the Bladder. Once by chance I had the ſame of one Janetus a Printer at</hi> Rome <hi>in cure, whom I purged that he might be cut with more ſafety. For he had tried all the Venetian and Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentine Phyſitians. But when nothing did him good, be ſent for the Prieſt to conſult about his ſoul, and reſolved to be cut. The Prieſt being a Jeſuite, and hearing his Confeſſion, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his Diſeaſe, told him a Medicine, of which he had made tryal in himſelf and others. He tryed, and was cured in the space of nine daies. The Medicine was this:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Pouder of Hog-lice or Sows, one dram, or four ſcruples at the moſt: Aqua vitae half an ounce: red Peaſe Broth, nine or ten ounces. Let him take it five hours before dinner.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I cured one of eighteen yeers of age, of a hot and dry complexion, by taking away ſome part of the Aqua vitae, and gave it him but every other day, and at other daies of Bean and Strawberry Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of each five ounces, with ſix drops of Oyl of Vitriol, and one ounce of the Julep of Violets to cool him, thus:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the pouder of Sows prepared, one ſcruple: Aqua vitae two ſcruples: red Peaſe Broth eight ounces. Mix them, and give it ſix hours before meat.</hi> Thus <hi>Augenius.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <hi>Sennertus</hi> in his Chapter of the Stone in the Bladder, tels a famous ſtory of <hi>William Lauremberg,</hi> Profeſſor of <hi>Roſtoch,</hi> who being old, and troubled with the ſtone, was unwilling to be cut, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſought for other Remedies. Firſt he tried the famous Water againſt the Stone, which is ſo much prized by Princes, which is thus made:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Salt of white Tartar one ounce: Parſley Water one pint: Mix them, and ſtrain them with a brown Paper; and with Orange peels make it yellow. He uſed alſo the Indian Jewel, called in Spaniſh, Igiada, which is moſt famous for breaking the Stone; but both to no purpoſe. Therfore be deſired to make tryal of the Medicine of Sows, which</hi> Horatius Augenius <hi>ſaith, cured two yong men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In imitation of whom, after general Phyſick, and good Diet, he took of Sows one ſcruple; the Spirit of Juniper two ſcruples; red Peaſe Broth ten ounces: which he took in the morning; but the firſt and ſecond time he found a ſtraightneſs in his Breaſt, and a fainting, ſo that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to take one dram of Treacle with the Potion; and ſo uſed it fifteen daies: but all this while he voided no gravel. And then he added other things, and made it thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>prepared Sows two ounces: a Hares and Goats Blood prepared, wild Roſe Flowers, and purple Violet ſeeds, of each one ounce: Species Lithontribi, two ſcruples: mix them for an Antidote, of which take two ſcruples: the Diuretick Decoction ten ounces: the Spirit of Juniper two ſcruples.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which Medicine after he had taken it the ſecond time at five a clock in the morning, four hours after he felt a great pain under the <hi>Os Publis,</hi> about the Neck of the Bladder: A little after he made a little Water, and therewith ſome thin red things like ſcales of fiſhes; which though they ſeemed to be ſlimy, yet when they were touched turned to ſand. So that it plainly appeared that they were the outſide of the Stone.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="382" facs="tcp:49088:187"/>By the continuance of this Medicine, every fourth or fifth day he voided the like ſcales, and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times bigger pieces, eſpecially when he uſed a ſweet bath. But when the neck of the bladder was wounded by the fragments and the ſtone, he uſed Medicines to aſſwage pain; and by the uſe of theſe Medicines, was in ſeventeen months cured. The Decoction was.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Liquoris four ſcruples: Roots of Marſh-mallows, Couch-graſs, Reſt-harrow, of each half an ounce: Winter Cherries twenty: red Peaſe ſix ounces: Raiſons one ounce: the four great cold Seeds, of each one ſcruple: Barley two handfuls. Boyl them in Winter Cherry Water, Reſt-harrow, Strawberry, and Bean Flower Water, of each one pint and an half: to the ſtraining add of the Syrup of Marſh-mallows four ounces.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Sows are thus prepared:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>live Sows two pound; waſh them in Reſt-harrow Water: then drown them in Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Wine; then powr the Wine out, and put them in Glaſſes, the more Glaſſes the better, becauſe then they will dry better: Put theſe Glaſſes well ſtopt into the Oven when the Bread is drawn, that they may dry gently till they will pouder: then put ſome Spaniſh Wine upon this Pouder, as much as it will take in, and dry it again; do ſo thrice: and fourthly waſh it with this Liquor:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Straw-berry Water three ounces: Spirit of Vitriol half a dram: mix them Then dry it, and make it fine, and keep it in a Glaſs for your uſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beſides the aforeſaid, the uſe of the diſtilled Water of Goats blood, or of the Urin of a Goat new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſlain, which was formerly mentioned in the Stone of the Kidneys.</p>
                     <p>If the Stone cannot be broken with Medicines, neceſſity requireth the manual operation, though it be dangerous, leſt the Patient die with lingering pain. This requires a skilful and wel exerciſed Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, and that it may have good ſucceſs, as we have obſerved.</p>
                     <p>It is the Duty of the Phyſitian, before the operation to prepare the body by bleeding, purging, and diet, as the ſtate of the buſineſs requireth. And obſerve, that the taking away of a ſtone from a Woman hath no danger, becauſe it is done only by enlarging the Paſſage of the Urine, which in them is very ſhort.</p>
                     <p>If the Patient fear cutting, or want a good Chyrurgion, he may uſe aſſwaging Medicines leaſt the Stone ſhould cut and ulcerate the neck of the bladder, ſuch as are preſcribed for heat of Urine.</p>
                     <p>But if a ſtone faſtened in the neck of the bladder ſtop the Urine, it muſt be ſhaken back with lying upon the back with the leg up, and the body ſhaked; and then by a good ſomentation or bath, and with a Catheter, let the ſtone be ſent back into the bladder.</p>

                        <hi>Chap. 3.</hi> Of the Inflamation of the Reins and Bladder.</head>
                     <p>BEcauſe the Inflamation of the Reins and Bladder are cured with the ſame Medicines, therefore we will put them in the ſame Chapter, although the Signs are different, as ſhall be ſhewed.</p>
                     <p>This Inflamation is a Tumor of thoſe Parts, from the flowing of Blood or Choller unto them.</p>
                     <p>This is not very ordinary, becauſe the ſubſtance of thoſe parts is ſolid and thick; but ſomtimes it happeneth, becauſe the Kidneys are fleſhy and apt to receive blood: but the Bladder, though it be without blood, and ſpermatick, becauſe it receives blood for its Nouriſhment through the ſmal Veins, is without queſtion ſubject to Inflamation by too much blood; as other Membranes of the Brain, or Meninges, the Pleura, Mediaſtinum, and the like.</p>
                     <p>We ſaid that theſe Inflamations come from Blood or Choller, as when Flegm or Melancholly in the Blood make the parts thicker, becauſe they cannot pierce into their thick ſubſtance.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes of this Diſeaſe, are either from things Natural, not Natural, or Pretema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.</p>
                     <p>From Natural things, when there is a Natural Infirmity of thoſe parts from the Parents, or a great looſneſs of them, a great heat originally in them, by which they draw plenty of Humors: In Youth theſe conduce much to an Inflamation.</p>
                     <p>From things not Natural, as much Venery, which weakeneth thoſe parts, and draws much blood or other Humors to them; Gluttony, Drunkenneſs, and eating of Salt and Spiced Meats; great Paſſions of the Mind, lying upon the back in a ſoft bed, great Exerciſe, ſtoppage of ſome great E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>acuations, as of the Months and Hemorrhoids, or uſual bleeding at the Noſe, thoſe things which cauſe repletion and evil concoction, and drive the humors to the inward bowels.</p>
                     <p>From Preternatural things, as a ſtroak or wound upon the Reins, or about the Bladder; a preſſing or bruiſe of thoſe parts; conſtant Feavers, foulneſs of the Veſſels, or other parts that purge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:49088:187"/>
by Urine, as in a Pleuriſie, Empyema or impoſthume in the ſide, Obſtruction of the Spleen, breaking of the Meſentery, and the like. And laſtly, Diſeaſe of thoſe parts do cauſe Inflamation, as the ſtone, great pain, exulceration, heat of Urine, and ſtoppage thereof, or the like.</p>
                     <p>The Signs of the Inflamation of the Reins, are a weighty pain in the Reins, ſomtimes beating, if the place be affected where the Arteries are: And this pain extendeth to the parts adjacent, ſo that the Patient can neither lift himſelf up, not ſtand upon his feet, and ſcarce turn himſelf, and neither lie upon his ſide, nor his Belly, becauſe then the part inflamed will hang down; therefore he lies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies upon his back, and if he either neeze, or otherwiſe move his Body, the pain is encreaſed. He hath a numbneſs or pain in the Leg on the ſame ſide, by reaſon of the Nerve that goes from thence to it. He hath difficulty of piſſing by reaſon of the heat which is ſent to the Urine, and filth mixed with it coming from the inflamed part. The Urine is firſt thin and yellow but after red and thick; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e hath a conſtant ſharp Feaver, which is attended often with watchings, dotings, and other great Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes; alſo loathing and vomiting, by which he voids Choller, Flegm, and other Humors.</p>
                     <p>Somtimes the Gut Colon is inflamed, and if it be that part which is neer the Liver, it brings the like Symptomes: but here is the difference; In the Inflamation of the Reins, the pain reacheth to the ſhort Ribs, the Back, and Bladder; but that of the Colon tends more to the Belly, and there is a greater change of Excrements of the Belly, than in the Inflamation of the Kidneys.</p>
                     <p>But in the Inflamation of the Kidneys, there is a pain about the <hi>Pubis</hi> and <hi>Perinaeum,</hi> in which there is heat, and ſomtimes redneſs. There is conſtant heat of Urine, but that is ſtopped when the part ſwelleth, and ſtoppeth the paſſage.</p>
                     <p>The ſtraight Gut ſuffers by reaſon of its neerneſs; hence it is that there is often deſire to go to ſtool with burning, ſomtimes the belly is bound, when the Gut is ſtopped by the inflamed Bladder. There are alſo other common Symptomes mentioned in the Inflamation of the Reins, as a Feaver, watching, doting, thirſt, and the like.</p>
                     <p>There can be no good Prognoſtick in this Diſeaſe: For the inward Inflamation of the noble inward parts, do threaten continual danger of death. It is moſt deadly when a Convulſion or dotage follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, or the like great Symptome: and if there be a cold ſweat, death is at hand.</p>
                     <p>In the Inflamation of the Reins, if the Hemorrhoids follow, it is good.</p>
                     <p>If the Inflamation Suppurate, and the Impoſthume break, and go into the paſſage of the Urine, there is hope; but if it go by the Emulgent Veins into the Liver, and labor to get way through the Guts, it is dangerous.</p>
                     <p>A final Inflamation of the Bladder with a Sediment in the Urine that is white and equal, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth health.</p>
                     <p>An Inflamation of the bladder, is ſomtimes cured by an Eryſipelas, or Chollerick Humor ariſing in the Skin ſuddenly, and by making much Urine.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of both Inflamations of the Reins and Bladder, is made by revelling, deriving, cooling, and moderately repelling, by Anodines, Reſolvers or Ripeners, if need be, and the like: whoſe Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and way of uſing, ſhall be as followeth:</p>
                     <p>And firſt, Phlebotomy is very neceſſary in the Liver Vein, on the ſame ſide the pain is, twice, thrice, or four times, or oftener, if the ſtrength will bear it, til the defluxion ceaſeth, which you may know by the abating of the pain. But in the Inflamation of the bladder, the right ſide is to be choſen by reaſon of the Liver, from whence, as from a Fountain, the blood floweth to the part.</p>
                     <p>After much blood is taken away, and revulſion is made by the upper Vein, you muſt alſo open the inferior for derivation ſake, in the Ham or Ancle; as alſo the Hemorrhoids are to be opened, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if they be ſwelled.</p>
                     <p>Cupping-glaſſes with Scarrification, are alſo good for Revulſion, both above and beneath, and Frictions with ſtrong Ligatures of the extream parts, to draw the humors outward.</p>
                     <p>After, and before blood-letting, give a mollifying and cooling Clyſter that is a little looſening, and let it be of a ſmal quantity, leſt it oppreſs the Tumor, thus made:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Marſh-mallow Roots one ounce: Mallows, Violets, Lettice, of each one handful: ſweet Prunes four pair: Barley and Violet Leaves, of each one pugil: make a Decoction to eight or ten ounces. In the ſtraining diſſolve of Caſſia, or Diaprunes ſimple, one ounce: Oyl of Violets four ounces: two Yolks of Eggs: Make a Clyſter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Allay the heat of the blood with Juleps and Emulſions made thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Endive, Littice, and Purſlain Water, of each four ounces: Syrup of Pomegranates two ounces: Syrup of Water Lillies one ounce. Make a Julep for three draughts, morning and evening.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Sorrel Roots two ounces: Mallows, Plantane, Purſlain, and Endive, of each one handful: the tops of white Poppies half a handful: Annis and Lettice ſeed, of each one dram: Borrage, Violets, and Water-lilly Flowers, of each one pugil: boyl them to a pint and an half: then add four ounces of the juyce of Pomegranates.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="384" facs="tcp:49088:188"/>Take of <hi>ſweet Almonds blanched one ounce: freſh Pine-nuts half on ounce: Lettice, Sorrel, Purſlain, and Poppy ſeeds, of each three drams: beat them according to art, powering on by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, of Barley, Lettice, and Purſlain Water<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one pint and an half. Diſſolve in the ſtraining, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar of Roſes one ounce. Make an Emulſion for three Doſes, in which we leave out the great cold Seeds, becauſe being Diuretick they may draw ſomthing to thoſe parts, eſpecially in the time of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxion, but in the declination they may be uſeful. You may profitably add to the Emulſion, the Syrup of Poppies to ſtop the flux more violently.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Alſo the parts inflamed may be cooled by Clyſters, made of the Decoction of the Julep aforeſaid, with Oyl of Roſes or Violets two ounces.</p>
                     <p>In the beginning of theſe Inflamations, purging is not proper; for it is to be feared leſt the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors being moved, ſhould flow to the parts affected; ſo that if there then be a great flux of the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is to be ſtopped for that cauſe. But when the Inflamation is a little allayed, and the diſeaſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth, a Purge made of gentle things may be good, as of Manna, Caſſia, Rhubarb, Tamarinds, Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prunes ſimple, Catholicon and Syrup of Roſes with a Decoction of Lettice, Purſlain, and other coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling things preſcribed in the Juleps. Or you may make a Bolus of ſome of them.</p>
                     <p>Out wardly, All the time of the Diſeaſe, you muſt apply cooling things that gently repel, as moiſt Epithems of the Water and Juyce of Plantane, Sorrel, Endive, Nightſhade, Roſes, with a little Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, red Sanders, and Camphire. Liniments alſo of Oyl of Roſes and Olives, Violets, Cerat of Sanders, white Oyntment, or Populeon alone, or mixed with a little Vinegar, which you muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the parts aforeſaid, every hour cold.</p>
                     <p>Or you may make a Liniment of an Egg wel beaten, with a little Oyl and Roſe Vinegar.</p>
                     <p>Or you may make that which is excellent, of Oyl of Roſes, with Vinegar and Juyce of Knot-graſs, or Purſlain; to which add, if you pleaſe, a new Yolk of an Egg. Let theſe be applied cold upon a Cloth.</p>
                     <p>If the pain be very violent, it is not amiſs in theſe Epithems and Liniments, to mix a little Opium or Saffron.</p>
                     <p>Alſo you may make a Cataplaſm of Barley Meal, with Juyce of Endive, Purſlain, and Nightſhade, with Oyl of Roſes and Populeon. But this muſt be often changed leſt it grow hot.</p>
                     <p>Three things are to be diligently obſerved:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That you uſe not Coolers too long, leſt the Matter be kept from breathing forth, and the Tumor grow hard or ſcirrhus.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, In the Inflamation of the Bladder, you muſt uſe leſs aſtringents and coolers, leſt you ſtop the Urine, which Symptome alone, is very uſual and dangerous in this caſe.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Cataplaſms in the Inflamation of the Bladder, are leſs neceſſary than Oyntments and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niments, becauſe they burden the part, ſo that it is more hard to dilate it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>After you have uſed Coolers a ſhort ſpace, and often bleeding, when the defluxion is ſomwhat ſtopped, you muſt uſe Softeners and Diſſolvers; ſuch are, Fomentations of the Decoction of Marſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mallow Roots, Mallows, Violets, Pellitory, Lin-ſeed, Foenugreek, Mallows, Cotton-weed, with Mehlot, Chamomel, Roſemary flowers, and Roſe Leaves to ſtrengthen the part.</p>
                     <p>Then apply a Liniment of Oyl of Lillies, with a little Oyl of Chamomel.</p>
                     <p>Among the Diſſolvers and Anodines together, there is none better than the Cataplaſm made of Crums of Bread, made thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>white Bread Crums one pound; boyl it in Goats Milk to a Pultiſs: then add three Yolks of Eggs; four ounces of Oyl of Roſes: half a ſcruple of Saffron: make a Cataplaſm, change it often. You may add a little Opium and Campbire if the pain be very great.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the Inflamation of the Bladder, if you fear a Gangrene, you may make a ſtrengthening Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſm of Bean Meal, and Orobus Meal, or Lupines boyled in Wine.</p>
                     <p>When the greateſt part of the Inflamation is abated, then you muſt uſe Decoctions and Liniments which do only diſſolve, that the reliques may be conſumed.</p>
                     <p>In the whol time of the Cure, you muſt have a ſpecial care of great Symptomes, as the Feaver, pain, watching, ſtoppage of Urine, and belly; of the ſtomach and other parts.</p>
                     <p>And as for the Feaver, pain, and watchings, it is moſt certain that the things mentioned to evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and alter, do much for the mitigation of them. But to them you may add Epithems, Liniments, and Roſe Vinegar, ſuch as uſe to be applied to the Region of the Liver, Heart, and Brain; and in time of neceſſity, Narcoticks both by mouth and Clyſter.</p>
                     <p>There are ſpecial Anodine Suppoſitories to take away the pain of the Bladder, or knots, made with Yolks of Eggs, and a little Opium, and juyce of Henbane, or the like.</p>
                     <p>If the Strangury or ſtoppage of Urine follow this Inflamation, you muſt cure them with Medicines taken from their proper Chapters.</p>
                     <p>If the Inflamation of the Reins cannot be cured by what hath been preſcribed, but it tendeth to ſuppuration, which you may know by the encreaſe of the feaver, pain, and other Symptomes; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:49088:188"/>
by trembling and vomiting, by greater weight about the part, eſpecially when the Patient lieth on his ſound ſide; you muſt help Nature with Cataplaſms of Roots and mollifying Herbs, Line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed, Chamomel flowers: To which being boyled and beaten, you muſt add Meal, Butter, Greaſe, or Oyls of the ſame vertues With which, if the Impoſthume break not preſently, and come forth by Urine, the Matter wil get into the Cavity of the Abdomen, whence wil proceed either ſudden death, or a Hectick Feaver. Somtimes the Tumor appears outwardly, and then you muſt open it either with a Potential Cautery, or an Inciſion Knife.</p>
                     <p>Somtimes thoſe Tumors grow hard, and ſcirrhus, when the Feaver is gone, and the pain remains with a greater ſence of weight, and a kind of numbneſs of the ſubject parts: And this is commonly incurable, and brings an evil habit, or a Dropſie. Yet you may try with mollifying, cutting, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting Medicines, ſuch as were mentioned in the Scirrhus of the Liver.</p>

                        <hi>Chap. 4.</hi> Of Piſsing of Blood.</head>
                     <p>BLood may come from divers parts to the paſſages of the Urine, and be mixed with it, and make it look like blood: but becauſe this happeneth but ſeldom, and we here treat only of the Diſeaſes of the Reins and Bladder, we ſhal ſpeak only of that bloody Urine which is made ſo from the defect of the Reins and Bladder. Blood flows from theſe parts, as from al the reſt (as we ſaid in Haemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhagy, Haemoptyſis, vomiting of blood, and Haemorrhoids) either by Anaſtomoſis, or opening of the mouths of the Veins, by Rixis, or Rupture, by Diabroſis or Corroſion, and ſeldom by Diapedeſis, or Rarefaction.</p>
                     <p>The uſual cauſes are much or ſharp blood, or a ſtone faſtened in the Reins: the Veins are often broken with plenty of blood; but Corroſion, or Anaſtomoſis, or opening comes from ſharpneſs: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo corroſion or tearing may come from the ſtone, when being fixed in the Reins or Kidneys through violent riding, or other exerciſe, it is moved ſo that it hurts the parts with its roughneſs.</p>
                     <p>Alſo other cauſes may break the Veſſels beſides repletion, as a fal or ſtroak, lifting, carrying, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement motion, and the like.</p>
                     <p>That Blood which is brought forth by Urine from Plethory, is not alwaies a Diſeaſe or Symptome, but ſomtimes for the good of the Patient, when Nature laies that which is burdenſom unto her by that means, as <hi>Aret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>us</hi> reports that ſome piſs blood at ſeveral times, and when they do not, they have the Head-ach, miſts before their Eyes, and giddineſs.</p>
                     <p>Alſo the Bladder may bleed if it be wounded by a ſtone, or corroded by a ſharp humor; but it is but little, becauſe it is membranous, and without blood; but if the Sphincter Muſcle be hurt, or the paſſage of the Yard, there wil be much blood, as in extraordinary Venery is ſeen often, eſpecially when the <hi>Proſtates</hi> are inflamed by a Gonorrhoea, or running of the Reins.</p>
                     <p>The Signs of this Diſeaſe are from the Kind of it, from the Part affected, and from the Cauſe.</p>
                     <p>The Kind of this Diſeaſe is apparent to the Sences, for it is eaſie to know when blood is mixed with Urine, for it is like the waſhings of fleſh, with ſmal clodders at the bottom; ſomtimes the Urine is like a Lye, when it ſtaies too long it the Bladder, by which means it grows black.</p>
                     <p>The place of the pain ſhews the part affected, for if it be in the Loyns, it ſignifies that the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys are affected; but if it be in the belly below the Navel, the bladder is the part ſuffering. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, if the blood comes from the Reins, it is mixed perfectly with the Urine; but if from the bladder, it is not mixed. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſheweth this Sign in two Aphoriſms, namely, in Aph. 78. Sect. 4. <hi>They who ſuddenly piſs blood without force, have a Vein broken in their Reins;</hi> and Aph. 80. of the ſame Section; <hi>If men piſs blood, or there be clots or drops in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine, and pain in the lower part of the Belly, the Pecten, or Perinaeum, theſe have their diſeaſe from the Bladder.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If it come from the ſtone, the ſigns thereof which are mentioned in its proper Chapter, wil appear; if they do not, you muſt conclude that it comes from too much blood or ſharpneſs thereof. The abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of blood wil be known by the ſigns of repletion, and ſharpneſs by the ſigns of Choller or Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly predominating; alſo ſalt flegm in the Urine wil make a great ſtoppage of Urine, and piſſing of blood; this hapneth often in old men that are very apt to be troubled with ſalt flegm. And the piſſing of blood from ſharp humors, is diſtinguiſhed from that in the ſtone, that in which there were firſt pains of the Reins, and voiding of ſtones; but not in the other whoſe Urine is cleer, with no ſtrange things therein, And the Diſeaſe proceeds not only from immoderate Exerciſe, which is ordinary to both cauſes, but alſo from the paſſions of the mind, when it comes from ſharp humors which are much ſtirred up by paſſions; ſo that they who are ſubject to this Diſeaſe after Anger and Sadneſs, or great diſturbance of the mind, uſe commonly to piſs blood.</p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſtick. A plentiful and often piſſing of blood is very dangerous; for it wil bring either a Conſumption or a Dropſie: And if it continue long, it may cauſe an Ulcer in that part from
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:49088:189"/>
whence the blood floweth; if much blood flow at one time, it wil cauſe a great ſtoppage of Urine in the Bladder, or ſome other evil Symptomes, as it encreaſeth therein, and grows evil qualified.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of this Diſeaſe is divers, according to the variety of the cauſe.</p>
                     <p>And firſt, if it come from blood abounding, or from ſharpneſs, it muſt be firſt cured with Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomy on the ſame ſide, often and little for the better revulſion: And by Cupping, Friction, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatures in the upper parts; and if blood flow violently, Cupping-glaſſes muſt be applied to the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondria.</p>
                     <p>For derivation, let the Vein of the Ancle be opened, and the Hemorrhoids.</p>
                     <p>When watery Chollerick Humors cauſe it, let them be purged with Medicines mentioned in ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of blood, often repeated at diſtance. To which alſo you may add theſe following, at your diſcretion.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Pouder of torrefied Rhubarb one dram: prepared Coral half a ſcruple: Goats Whey, or Plantane Water three ounces. Make a Potion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Caſſia newly drawn half an ounce: the Pulp of Tamarinds ſix drams: Eaſtern Bole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armenick half a ſcruple. With Sugar make a Bolus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After due Evacuations and Revulſions, or at that time, if need require<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you may uſe things to ſtop blood, and knit the Veins. And theſe are not preſently to be uſed at the firſt, left being ſtopped too ſuddenly it ſhould grow cloddy in ſome part. For this purpoſe the Juyce of Plantane newly drawn, is much commended, given four or five ounces in a morning and evening, which is good for any kind of bleeding. But if you fear it will cool the Stomach too much, you may boyl it a little with Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.</p>
                     <p>Sheeps Milk is much commended by <hi>Foreſtus,</hi> Lib. 24. Obſerv. 13. <hi>Often</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I have cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red piſſing of blood with only Sheeps Milk ſix ounces, and one dram of Bole-armenick.</hi> The ſame is an Experience of <hi>Gatinaria;</hi> who alſo commands that none do ſleep preſently, or exerciſe after it. Alſo <hi>Hollerius</hi> and <hi>Duretus,</hi> from <hi>Avicen</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> commend the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Alſo Decoctions of Knot-graſs, Horſtail, Purſlain, and Bramble tops, are good for this, adding the third part of the Juyce of ſharp Pomegranates or Quinces.</p>
                     <p>Or to allay the heat of the Blood, let him take the Apozeme following many times, morning and evening.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Lettice, Purſlain, Plantane, and Comphry, of each one handful: all the cold ſeeds, of each one dram: Jujubes three pair: Liquoris half an ounce: Water-lillies, Violets, and Roſes, of each one pugil: boyl them to a pint and an half. In the ſtraining diſſolve of Gum Traganth one dram and an half: Syrup of Violets and dried Roſes, of each one ounce and an half: Lapis pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nellae half an ounce: the Troches of Winter-cherries without Opium, half a dram. Make a Julep for four Doſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To thicken and ſtop the blood more, put one ounce of Syrup of Poppies thereto.</p>
                     <p>Alſo you may give the Pouders that ſtop blood, as of red Coral, Blood-ſtone, Bole-armenick, fealed Earth, either with the Apozeme, or with Roſe or Plantane Water.</p>
                     <p>If the Diſeaſe continue, give this Opiate:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Conſerve of Roſes, and Comphry Roots, of each two ounces: Sealed Earth, Bole-ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menick, Sanguis Draconis, red Coral, Blood-ſtone, and Troches of Amber, of each one dram: Hypocyſtis, or Conſerve of Sloes, Kermes berries, and Plantane ſeeds, of each one ſcruple: with Syrup of Poppies and Myrtles, of each equal parts: make an Opiate, of which let him take the bigneſs of a Cheſnut morning and evening, drinking after a little Plantane Water.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If it yet continue, it is good to give at diſtance the Decoction of Myrobalans in Whey, or the like.</p>

                     <p>For ordinary Drink, give the Infuſion of Maſtich wood in Wine, made thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>ſliced Maſtich wood one ounce: ſpring Water four ounces: Infuſe them in Balneo Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae very warm in a cloſe Veſſel. Keep the ſtraining for your uſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But becauſe clods of blood are often retained in the bladder, which beget grievous Symptomes, give warm Water and Vinegar, or Mallow Water and ſharp Vinegar warm. Let the Vinegar be ſo little that it is ſcarce taſted.</p>
                     <p>Apply Topicks to the Loyns that cool and aſtringe.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Snakeweed and Comphry Roots, of each one ounce: Plantane, Purſlain, Horſ-tail, Knot-graſs, and Sbepheards-purſe, of each one handful: Pomegranate peels half an ounce: Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and Myrtle berries, and Hypocyſtis, of each two drams: Acron Cups, red and yellow San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, of each one dram: red Roſes three pugils: boyl them in Smiths Water, and a little Vinegar.

                     <p>THe Ulcer of the Reins and Bladder, comes of three Cauſes; from an Impoſthume broken after Suppuration; from the ſharpneſs of Humors, ſuch as cauſeth piſſing of blood, which being vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and continual, doth ulcerate the parts, or from a ſharp ſtone that corrodeth them; the laſt is moſt uſual, the former ſeldom.</p>
                     <p>Among the Signs, the chief is voiding of Matter with Urine, which laſting long, doth ſhew that there is an Ulcer certainly in the Ureters. But whether the Reins, or the Bladder be affected, is known by the place of pain, whether it be in the Loyns, or neer the Privities. Moreover, If Matter come from the Reins, it is better concocted, white, thin, and not ſtinking, becauſe the body of the Kidneys being fleſhy doth better concoct; beſides, the Matter is more abundant, and more mixed with the Urine, which is voided like Milk, till after long ſtanding it ſettle to the bottom. That Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which comes from the Bladder, is little, and not much mixed with the Urine, not ſo wel concocted, but crude, of divers colors, and ſtinking; for that part being without blood, and having little heat, cannot concoct ſufficiently. But often pure Matter is voided without Urine, from the neck of the Bladder, and then there is a continual difficulty of Urine, and pain in that part, which is not in an Ulcer of the Reins but by fits.</p>
                     <p>When the Ulcer is in the Reins, ſomtimes much Blood is voided, which is hard to be ſtopped, and ſomtimes pieces of fleſh and matter, or blood, ſomtimes ſo big as they hardly paſs, and cauſe pain; but from the bladder come ſcales, or skins, or bran.</p>
                     <p>And from an old Ulcer of the Bladder that is callous or hard, there flows that ſnotty flegm which we ſpake of in the ſtone of the Bladder.</p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſtick: All inward Ulcers are dangerous, but theſe moſt, becauſe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant flux of Humors to theſe parts; for although the ſerous humor hath a clenſing quality; yet here being mixed with other qualities, it doth not as in its Natural condition; and if evil, ſalt, and ſharp humors are mixed therewith, they will make and nouriſh an Ulcer.</p>
                     <p>New Ulcers of the Reins and Bladder are curable, old not.</p>
                     <p>They are incurable in old men, ſomtimes incurable in yong men, with much difficulty.</p>
                     <p>Ulcers that come from the Stone, and are maintained by it, cannot be cured before it be taken out.</p>
                     <p>The pain and Symptomes which accompany the aforeſaid Ulcers, cauſe watchings, and conſume the Body.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="388" facs="tcp:49088:190"/>The Cure is by clenſing drying, and heating, as al other. For this purpoſe uſe theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, If there be a repletion, or inflamation in the part affected, let blood, firſt in the Arm, then in the Hand.</p>
                     <p>Then purge often, to take away the vitious humors that flow to the part affected, but with gentle things, as Caſſia, Manna, Syrup of Roſes, Agarick, Rhubarb, made into a Bolus; becauſe in a moiſt form being drunk, they quickly go to the Ureters, and encreaſe pain.</p>
                     <p>You may give this Opiate following:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Polypody of the Oak, and Liquoris, of each half an ounce: the four great cold ſeeds, of each one dram: Borrage and Violet flowers, of each half a pugil: Jujubes ſix pair, Damask Prunes three pair: ſmal Raiſons half an ounce: Senna one ounce and an half: Infuſe them all night in Barley Water; then boyl and ſtrain them: then diſſolve of Manna one ounce and an half; Caſſia three ounces: boyl them to an Opiate, adding in the end half an ounce of Rhubarb in pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Give one ounce at a time, once in a week, two hours before meat.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Caſſia two ounces: Manna one ounce and an half: the Mucilage of Fleabane ſeeds ſix drams: the four great cold ſeeds, of each one dram: the Juyce of Liquoris two drams: With Syrup of Roſes ſolutive make an Opiate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe Opiates wil be better if you put Mercurius dulcis to them, becauſe Mercury doth clenſe and heal al Ulcers both internal and external.</p>
                     <p>Turpentine is purging, and excellent in this Diſeaſe, becauſe it clenſeth the Ulcer. And you muſt give half an ounce thereof waſhed at once, with Pouder of Liquoris. But it is chiefly good when the Urine is thick.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Avicen</hi> commends Vomiting for this Diſeaſe, <hi>Cap. de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer. Renum, A Vomit</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is the beſt way to cure an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer in the Reins, becauſe it clenſeth and emptieth, and draweth the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors from the part.</hi> But <hi>Aetius</hi> in his Chapter <hi>de ſuppuratis Renibus; If</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>any man will take a ſtrong Vomit every month, he will happily cure the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer of the Reins, or any other evil that ariſeth from them.</hi> Many Modern Phyſitians follow theſe; ſome gave warm Oyl and Water one hour before meat: which only Medicine being often repeated hath cured this Diſeaſe, as they ſay. But <hi>Rondeletius</hi> wil have them vomit after meat, becauſe then men vomit moſt eaſily; and he gives warm Water and Oyl, and anoints the Stomach with Oyl of Lillies. But you muſt never give a Vomit, but to them that are eaſie to vomit; for otherwiſe it would Inflame the Ulcer.</p>
                     <p>After due Evacuations and Revulſions, you muſt uſe Clenſers. The chief is, Whey taken every morning in abundance; or thin Hydromel, ſix or eight ounces in a morning in ordinary drink, or the Decoction of Barley and Liquoris with Sugar, and give Water and Sugar for ordinary Drink. You may boyl in Hydromel, if you fear heat, the cold Seeds, Liquoris, and Mallows. Aſſes Milk doth not only cleſe with its Wheyie part, but heal with its cheezy part, but you muſt not give it in a Feaver, or you may make this following Decoction to clenſe and eaſe pain.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Marſh-mallow Roots half an ounce: Plantane, Agrimony, Maiden-hair, and Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, of each one handful: Mallows and Melone Seeds with their Husks beaten, of each half an ounce: Winter Cherries ſix drams: ſcraped Liquoris one ounce: Barley one pugil: boyl them to two pints. Diſſolve in the ſtraining three ounces of Honey, and two ounces of Sugar candy: make a Julep. Take eight ounces every morning for ten daies.</hi>

                     <p>Thoſe Medicines you give for the Reins or Womb, muſt be given in great quantities leaſt they loſe their vertue before they come there.</p>
                     <p>Inſtead of them al, you may uſe Mineral Waters of Allum and Iron, by the conſtant uſe thereof the heat is corrected, and the Ulcer mundified and healed.</p>
                     <p>Some commend the Decoction of China, Sarſa, or Saſſaphras, or of Guajacum given thirty daies or more together, with a ſecond Decoction thereof for ordinary Drink, and a thin drying Diet; and leaſt the Bowels ſhould thereby be too much inflamed, they give cool Broths at night, and anoint the Reins with cold Oyntments. And this courſe is taken to dry up the matter, to purge and clenſe, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in them that are flegmatick, or have the French Pox, and have neither Feaver, nor Flux of Blood.</p>
                     <p>But in any caſe you may uſe with more ſafety this following:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Sarſaparilla three ounces: Shavings of Maſtich Tree two ounces: Saſſaphras one ounce: Shavings of Ivory and Harts-horn, of each ſix drams: Jujubes and Sebeſtens, of each half an ounce: Lignum Nephriticum four ounces: Barley two ounces. Infuſe them twelve hours in five pints of spring Water: boyl them to three pints, for ſix draughts, to be taken twice in a day; aromatize them with two drams of Cinnamon.</hi>

                        <hi>Chap. 6.</hi> Of <hi>Diabetes,</hi> or extraordinary Piſsing.</head>
                     <p>DIabetes is a quick and plentiful ſending forth of Drink by Urine; after which there comes a violent Thirſt, and conſuming of the whol Body.</p>
                     <p>It is called Diabetes <hi>apo tou diabainein,</hi> from paſſing through, as Water through a Conduit pipe, which is called Diabetes. This Diſeaſe is alſo called <hi>Dipſacos,</hi> from the unquenchable Thirſt, and the Piſs-pot Dropſie, from the continual making of Water. It is ſeldom ſeen, for <hi>Galen</hi> in 6. de loc. aff. cap. 3. ſaith that he ſaw it but twice.</p>
                     <p>The next and immediate Cauſe of this Diſeaſe, from <hi>Galen,</hi> and al his followers, is held to be a hot diſtemper of the Reins, which makes them draw Water violently from the Veins, and ſend it to the Bladder being not able to contain it themſelves; the Veins being drawn dry, ſuck from the Liver; the Liver from the Guts and Stomach; hence comes a continual Thirſt after drink, which as ſoon as it is taken, it is forthwith carried from the Liver and Veins into the Reins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where by its quantity it ſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Some ſuppoſe that this cauſe is inſufficient, becauſe the hot diſtemper of the Reins is an uſual diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, but Diabetes is very rare; therefore there muſt be ſomthing elſe that is leſs uſual, namely, a ſharp or ſalt Matter in the Kidneys, either of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>holler or of Flegm, which doth continually provoke the attractive vertue of them; as in Chollerick Feavers there is a Thirſt which cannot be quenched, from the Chollerick Humor which is fixed to the coat or Tunicle of the Stomach, or from Chollerick Vapors ſent from ſome adjacent part into the Stomach, by the motion of ſome putrid Choller which lodgeth there. This Opinion is probable; but we think good to add thus much to it, That the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys alone are not affected in this Diſeaſe, becauſe Choller and other burnt Humors are firſt bred in the Liver; and therefore they cannot be in any quantity in the Kidneys, but the Liver muſt parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate of them. And if we may reaſon where Nature ſeems to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ilent, we can ſay that there is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous quality concurring for the producing of this Diſeaſe. For that kind of Serpent called <hi>Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacos,</hi> found in <hi>Lybia,</hi> when it bites any man, doth ſend into him ſuch a poyſon as begets an unquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chable Thirſt. The like kind of venom may be bred in our Bodies, by a peculiar corruption of ſome humors, which may cauſe ſuch a Thirſt; for <hi>Galen</hi> teſtifieth that divers kinds of poyſons may breed in our Bodies. And if ſuch a kind of poyſon may be bred in our Bodies as may cauſe a deteſtation of
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:49088:191"/>
Drink, as in <hi>Hydrophobia,</hi> in which the Patient cannot endure the ſight of Water, or any Drink, why may not then there be produced another poyſon, which hath the contrary quality, to cauſe a great and unquenchable Thirſt? And hence may be the reaſon why this Diſeaſe is ſo rare; becauſe this kind of poyſon is ſeldom bred, but Choller and Salt Flegm, and the Diſeaſes from thence, are ordinary. And as the Diſeaſe called Dogs Appetite, which is compared to this for the unſatiable deſire of meat, is aſcribed by the wiſeſt Phyſitians to an occult quality; ſo this unquenchable thirſt may be ſaid to come from a peculiar and hidden quality.</p>
                     <p>The Signs of this Diſeaſe are cleer from what hath been ſaid; as an extraordinary making of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, an unquenchable Thirſt, and a ſudden piſſing forth of what is drunk, a decay of the whol Body; for the moiſture which would nouriſh the Body, is piſſed forth with the drink. And though there be often a large Evacuation of Urine in ſharp Feavers, and other caſes, yet that is not to be called Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betes, becauſe the aforeſaid Symptomes, as great Thirſt and Conſumption of the Body are not joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therewith.</p>
                     <p>The Prognoſtick of this Diſeaſe is deadly, for it is incurable, except it be in the beginning thereof; for it preſently brings a Conſumption. In old men it is more dangerous; and when it comes after inordinate Lechery, or Agues.</p>
                     <p>The Cure is wrought by allaying the hot diſtemper of the Kidneys, and by ſtrengthening them by thickening the Humors that flow unto them, and by oppoſing the malignant quality thereof; all which may be done with theſe Medicines following:</p>
                     <p>In the beginning of the Diſeaſe while there is ſtrength, you may open a Vein, for to revel or pluck back, and cool the Humors; but it muſt be done divers times, and but a ſmal quantity of blood taken away. But if the ſtrength be decayed, or if this follow another Diſeaſe, Phlebotomy muſt not be.</p>
                     <p>You muſt give Mollifying and Aſſwaging Clyſters to draw forth the Excrements, made thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Lettice, Purſlain, Mallows, and Plantane, of each one handful: clenſed Barley, and red Roſes, of each one pugil: make a Decoction to one pint and an half.

                     <p>Sweating is commended by Authors, by which means the ſerous Humor is drawn outward. But it is to be miſtruſted, becauſe it is very like to purge by Urine, and encreaſe the diſtemper of the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els. But if it be uſed at any time, it muſt be of the mildeſt ſort, as of Roots of China, Sarſa, Endive, Borrage, Sorrel boyled in Water, or for thoſe who are conſumed, in Chicken Broth; but we think it ſafer to provoke ſweat by outward means; as by a vapor from ſome convenient Decoction in a wooden Inſtrument.</p>

                     <p>THe not holding of the Urine conſiſts in the hurting of the Retentive action of the Bladder, as Diabetes, or extraordinary piſſing, comes from the hurt done to the attractive faculty, and Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuria from the diſtemper in the Expulſive: ſo this comes from the diſorder in the Retentive Faculty of the Bladder. This comes ſomtimes to people awake, and then the Diſeaſe is worſe; ſomtimes to them aſleep, and then it is leſs, becauſe then the animal Functions are exerciſed leſs freely. And this in time of ſleep comes two waies, either from weakneſs and looſneſs of the Sphincter Muſcle of the Bladder, as in ſucking Children, weak people, and ſomtimes in them of yeers, or from the hurt of the Imagination: for many do piſs their Beds, either from too much drink, or from the exquiſite ſence of the Bladder, and the Urines ſharpneſs, with ſome conſent of their will, when they dream they are piſſing againſt a wall, or other place; and they are ſo accuſtomed to it, that it is done without any diſtemper either of the Bladder, or its Sphincter; nor are they to be cured with Medicines, but by change of their fooliſh Imagination, as Children by whipping; or in thoſe of yeers, by adorning thoſe places which they dream they piſs upon, with ſome coſtly things, and ſhewing them often.</p>
                     <p>The true cauſe of this is in the Sphincter Muſcle, which ſuffers either from its ſelf, or by conſent from other parts.</p>
                     <p>It comes divers waies by conſent, as when the whol Body is weak, and the vital heat ſpent, as in dying men, or when the whol Body, or half of it is taken with the Palſey, or thoſe branches of Nerves which come from the <hi>Os Sacrum</hi> to the Bladder: ſomtimes the looſneſs of the Muſcle comes from the pain only, and neerneſs to other parts affected, as in Women with Child, from the ſwelling and pain of the Womb, and in the great Diſeaſe of the ſtraight Gut.</p>
                     <p>The Sphincter Muſcle ſuffers divers waies by its ſelf, as when it is wounded, as in cutting for the Stone, or in deep Ulcers which hinder its contraction and ſhutting. But the chief and uſual cauſe is, a cold and moiſt diſtemper, which is moſt fit to weaken and make looſe the part. Which is produced of a cold and moiſt Native temper, Youth, old Age, Women, and the Diſeaſes of the whol Body, or ſome parts thereof, coming of a moiſt and cold diſtemper: to theſe you may add external cauſes, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten mentioned.</p>
                     <p>But here we may diſpute how contrary Effects may be produced of the ſame Cauſe: for <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> in Coac. ſaies that ſtoppage of the Urine comes of a cold cauſe, in theſe words; <hi>A ſtoppage of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine coming of cold is worſt of all;</hi> now not holding, and ſtopping, are contrary. We muſt anſwer that when a cold diſtemper doth only hurt or aboliſh the ſence of the Bladder, there may be a ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Urine, becauſe the Bladder cannot be ſenſible of provocation to expel Urine: but if the motive faculty which is in the Sphincter Muſcle be hurt, by reaſon of the looſneſs of it, the Urine can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be retained.</p>
                     <p>The Signs of this Diſeaſe, either ſhew this Diſeaſe to be by conſent, and theſe muſt be taken from the Diſeaſes before mentioned, which are apt to produce this not holding the Urine, which if you find, you may conclude that the diſeaſe comes from them: but if they be abſent, then you muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think yourſelf of the propriety of the Diſeaſe to the part, which will be eaſily diſcovered if it come from a wound and Ulcer, or the like Diſeaſe of the Sphincter: but if neither of theſe appear, you muſt conſider of the cold and moiſt diſtemper of the part; and this is known by the cauſes both inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and external, and by the effects which depend upon them, as ſoftneſs of the whol Body, white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,

                     <p>As for the Prognoſtick.</p>
                     <p>This Diſeaſe is incurable in old men, by reaſon of their great moiſtneſs, and the loſs of Vital heat, which cannot be repaired.</p>
                     <p>In an acute Feaver, involuntary Piſſing is very dangerous; for it comes either of a Delirium, or from a great deſtruction of al the Faculties, which followeth the extinction of the Natural hear.</p>
                     <p>In Children it is cured when they grow elder, and the ſuperfluous humidity is by degrees conſumed, and the parts that were looſe, are more knit: But if they be not cured before twenty five yeers of age, they are incurable.</p>
                     <p>The Cure is wrought by amending the cold and moiſt diſtemper, and looſneſs of the Sphincter Muſcle; but that which comes by ſympathy from other diſeaſes, muſt be cured by the removing of them: as alſo that which comes from Wounds, Ulcers, and other manifeſt Diſeaſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, depends upon the Cure of them. Therefore we ſhall lay down a way of Cure proper both for Children and men, provided that the Phyſitian be skilful in the choyce of his Medicines, to give the gentleſt to Children, and that he encreaſe and diminiſh the quantity according to the Patients age.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Here is little uſe of Phlebotomy, becauſe it comes from a cold diſtemper, and flegm; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept there be a general Plethory in the whol Body, being youthful.</p>
                     <p>But Purging is alwaies neceſſary in this Diſeaſe, made of things that purge flegm, mixed with ſome aſtringents that are not only Alterers, but Purgers, as Rhubarb, and Myrobalans, and the like.</p>
                     <p>After, to dry up the Matter that is ſlegmatick, and to knit the part, you may uſe Pouders, Opiates, and Phyſick Wines, and the like, made thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Cypreſs Nuts, and Myrtles dried at the fire, ſhavings of Ivory, Coriander ſeeds prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, red Coral, and Amber, of each two drams: Spodium, or burnt Ivory one dram, Cypreſs Roots<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Galangal, of each half a dram: With the Syrup of Citrons make an Opiate, of which let him take the quantity of a Cheſnut morning and evening. Drink after it a little red Wine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or you may give the aforeſaid Pouder from half a dram to a dram, with red Wine twice in a day, long after, and before meat.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Comfry Roots half an ounce: Cypreſs Roots, and Galangal, of each one dram: Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane, Horſ-tail, and Five-leaved Graſs, with the Roots, of each one handful: Cypreſs Nuts, Acron Cups, of each four ſcruples: Rue ſeed, Agnus Caſtus, Frankinſence, and Ivory ſhavings, of each half a ſcruple: red Roſes one pugil: red Wine four pints. Infuſe them twenty four hours, ſtrain them through an Hippocras Bag, adding of Cinnamon half an ounce: Sugar as much as is ſufficient to make a Claret, of which let him take three or four ounces twice in a day.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Many proper things are propounded by Authors, which do conduce to the Cure of this Diſeaſe. <hi>Galen</hi> in his Book of Local Medicines, and of things eaſie to be prepared, commends the Brain and Stones of a Hair burnt. Alſo a Snail burnt, with its ſhell given to Drink. The Modern Phyſitians give Hares dung, pouder of burnt Mice, the Hoofs of Hogs burnt, the aſhes of Date ſtones, roaſted Hazel Nuts, pouder of Egg ſhels. But above all are commended the Pouder of Agrimony, and the inward Skins of Hens Gizzards dried, given either by themſelves, or mixed together with red Wine.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Solenander</hi> witneſſeth that he ſaw happy ſucceſs in a Medicine invented by one <hi>Gilbert Holland,</hi> a Roman Phyſitian: He took the Throat of a Cock, and dried it at the fire til it would pouder. He gave it before ſupper in red Wine, or with Oxycrate, for ſome daies together.</p>
                     <p>In people of yeers, ſweating Decoctions uſed twenty daies together, are good to dry the Body, made of Guajacum, and Saſſaphras; or Stuphs, Hot-houſes, Brimſtone Baths, and thoſe of Niter.</p>
                     <p>For his Drink, let him take ſharp red Wine without mixture, or with a little Ironed Water.</p>
                     <p>They who can drink only Water, may take Ironed Water, or that in which Coriander ſeed, or a little Maſtich hath been boyled. Or laſtly, for the better aſtringing, let them take Water in which new Tiles have been quenched, and boyl their meat with the ſame. But they muſt drink but little, eſpecially at Supper. And let the Patient make water when he goes to bed, and be raiſed again at midnight, and in the morning for the ſame purpoſe, and this wil alter cuſtom.</p>

                        <hi>Chap. 8.</hi> Of ſtoppage of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine, and Strangury.</head>
                     <p>THe ſtoppage of Urine is called by Authors <hi>Iſchouria;</hi> but when little is voided, it is called <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gouria:</hi> although this word be larger, and comprehends all dropping of Urine; but if it be without pain, and the Urine come by drops, with ſtraining, it is a ſmal ſſchuria; but if it be with pain, it muſt be referred to Dyſuria, or ſcalding of Urine.</p>
                     <p>Therefore Iſchuria, or a whol ſuppreſſion of Urine, is two-fold, namely true, when the bladder is full; or Spurious, when the Bladder is empty, and not thing comes to it from the Reins.</p>
                     <p>A true Iſchuria comes of three Cauſes: The firſt is when the ſence is loſt in the Bladder, by reaſon of the Palſey, and obſtruction of the Nerve that comes to it, or by the everſion of the Spirits, by whoſe defect it comes, ſo that the Bladder feeleth no pricking to expel, as in doting, and ſleepy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond cauſe is a diſtemper of the Bladder, coming from internal or external cold cauſes, which dull the ſence of the Bladder, and weaken its expulſion.</p>
                     <p>The third Cauſe is the narrowneſs of the Neck of the Bladder, which will not ſuffer the Urine to paſs. <hi>Galen</hi> gives three cauſes of this, 1. <hi>de loc. affect. cap.</hi> 1. either the Muſcle is ſwollen by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamation, Scirrhus, or Impoſthume, or the like; or there is a little fleſh grown in the paſſage, by reaſon of a former Ulcer; or there is a hardneſs from ſome thick Humor of long continuance. Alſo the Paſſage is ſtopped by the Stone, by a Crude and Thick Humor, by a Clod of Blood or Matter.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, The Urine may be ſtopt by a Tumor in ſome part nigh to the neck of the Bladder, from the ſwelling of the Womb, from the Excrements in the ſtraight Gut, or from the Hemorrhoids growing big.</p>
                     <p>Somtimes it comes from the long holding of the Water, by which the Bladder is ſo ſtretched that it cannot contract it ſelf to expel Urine, by which ſtretching, the paſſage is ſtopt and contracted. Now the Bladder is filled by Urine too long detained, two waies. Firſt, when a ſound man by urgent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions in the Market, Senate, Church Banquet, Running, and the like, holds his Urine for want of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to void it, which ſtretcheth it ſo that it cannot again contract it ſelf; and the pricking of the Urine is not perceived by reaſon of its dull ſence from the diſtemper of the Nerves which come thither, when thoſe Nerves which are for the contracting of the Muſcle, are well and ſound, which <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith befel one 6. de loc. aff. cap. 4. when his Back bone was ſtrained.</p>
                     <p>That is called a baſtard Iſchuria, in which the Urine is ſtopped, and the bladder empty, becauſe no Water deſcends into it. There is a two-fold Cauſe why no Urine comes to the Bladder, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Kidneys do not draw that wherof the Urin is made, and ſend it down, or becauſe the Ureters wil not receive it, therfore either the attractive or expulſive Faculty of the Reins is hurt. The attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive or drawing Faculty is hurt by the Error of the Object, or in its ſelf. This is from a ſtrong di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, eſpecially cold, or from ſome ſtoppage in the Reins, or in the Emulgent Veins. Theſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions proceed from the Stone, thick flegm, or Matter that falls down thither. The obſtruction of the Emulgents comes ſomtimes from too much blood, or ſerous Matter; a Story whereof we have in our Obſervations, Obſerv. I. Cent. I.</p>
                     <p>By the fault of the Object, the attraction of the Reins is hindered, when the ſerum or water is ſpent, as in burning Feavers; or ſent to other parts, as in a Dropſie.</p>
                     <p>The Expulſive Faculty is hurt by the ſame Cauſes, namely, diſtemper, the ſtone, clods of blood, matter, or groſs flegm, or Inflamation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="395" facs="tcp:49088:193"/>The Ureters do not receive the Serum, nor ſend it to the Bladder, by reaſon of Inflamations, or Obſtruction by the Stone, a clod of Blood, Matter, or thick flegm, or by a compreſſion from ſome hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor in a part adjacent.</p>
                     <p>We muſt obſerve that both Kidneyes or Ureters are affected, for the total ſtoppage of Urine; for if one be open, the Urine may paſs.</p>
                     <p>The aforeſaid Cauſes, if they be violent, may make a total Obſtruction of Urine, which is called <hi>Iſchuria;</hi> but if they be ſmal, or remiſs, they make only an evacuation in part, which is called a Strangury; and both Diſeaſes come from the ſame cauſe, different in degrees.</p>
                     <p>A true Iſchuria is known by the weight and enlarging of the lower part of the belly, and by a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor in form like the bladder.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes are known by things aforegoing, or that accompany it: For if it come from too great a quantity of Urine, which hinders the Contraction of the Bladder, the Patient wil tel you how that he forbore to piſs by reaſon of long riding, or the preſence of ſome people of Honor, and that before he never had any diſtemper in thoſe parts. But if he hath had a Delirium, a Palſey, or the like, you may refer the ſtoppage to them.</p>
                     <p>The Stoppage which comes from Tumors of thoſe, or the adjacent parts, or other Cauſes before mentioned, wil be known by their proper Signs.</p>
                     <p>The ſtopping of the paſſage of the Bladder is known by a ſearing Candle put in, or a Catheter; which if they cannot pierce, but are ſtopped by the way, ſhew that there is a either ſtone, or a Caruncle, or a little Excreſcens of fleſh, or the like in the paſſage.</p>
                     <p>And theſe are to be diſtinguiſhed; for if it be a Stone, there was formerly a pain of the Reins, whether it came from the Bladder or Reins. If a Caruncle, there was a ſtinking Gonorrhoea, or run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Reins, or an Ulcer in the paſſage of the Yard that did long run.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly, If there be a Clod of Blood, or Matter, or Flegm, you ſhal ſee ſome part of it come out of the Yard, or it wil ſtick to the Catheter.</p>
                     <p>A Baſtard Iſchuria is hence known, There is neither extenſion, nor Tumor, nor weight about the Privities, but rather a kind of emptineſs thereabout; there is no deſire to piſs, no tickling in the bladder, and no Urine made, there went before the ſigns of the Stone in the Kidneys, or Ureters, or of Inflamation, or great fulneſs, or much drink was taken, which was not plentifully piſſed forth: whence the Veins might be ſwoln, or elſe there is a burning Feaver, or a Dropſie, which ſignifie the revulſion, and turning away of the Water or ſerous Matter.</p>
                     <p>As to the Prognoſtick. The ſtoppage of Urine is very dangerous, and if it continue above ſeven daies, it is deadly: for the Serum being retained in the Veins, doth oppreſs the Liver, infect the blood, and runs into the whol body, it brings danger of choaking, and being carried to the brain, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth a Coma, or kind of Lethargy.</p>
                     <p>The ſtoppage of Urine which comes from the back, being wounded, or by a fall, or ſtraining of the Vertebrae, or back-bone, is incurable.</p>
                     <p>If the Patient ſtink of Piſs at his mouth or noſe, it is deadly.</p>
                     <p>If a Tenaſmus or Needing follow a ſuppreſſion of Urine, it is death in ſeven daies. And alſo if the Hiccough follow upon it.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of the ſtoppage of Urine, whether it be total or partial, muſt be by aiming at the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. And firſt, that ſuppreſtion which is called ſpurious, and depends upon the Diſeaſes of the Reins or Ureters, is to be found in the Cure of the Inflamation, pain, or ſtone of the Kidneys; that which comes from the fulneſs of the Emulgent Veins, is to be cured by large bleeding, and Medicines that purge Water. A true Iſchuria is cured by things that take away the cauſe: and firſt, if it come from Inflamation of the bladder, or parts adjoyning, you may find Medicines for it in the Cure of the Infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the bladder.</p>
                     <p>But if it come from a ſtone in the neck of the bladder, you muſt uſe theſe Remedies fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, you muſt lay the Patient upon his Back with his Thighs lifted up, and then ſhake him ſoundly to make the ſtone return into the Bladder: And if this wil not do it, uſe the Catheter. But if the ſtone be in the paſſage of the Yard, and you muſt labor to get it out with your fingers, gently ſtroa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it to the end of the Yard; and you muſt put the Yard into warm Water or Milk, or the Patient into a Bath to open the Paſſage. But if you can neither get it out nor in, Practitioners ſay that you may bind the Yard on both ſides of it, and take it out by Inciſion.</p>
                     <p>The Obſtruction of the neck of the bladder, which comes from Inflamation, wil be cured with the proper Medicines againſt Inflamation. But in the mean while, if the Urine be there long detained, you may gently conveigh in a ſearing Candle dipt in a little Oyl of ſweet Almonds, avoiding the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theter, left it cauſe pain, and ſo encreaſe the Inflamation.</p>
                     <p>If the ſtoppage of Urine comes from a Caruncle, you muſt take that away. This is done by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Medicines conveighed thither with a Wax Candle, which muſt be done by a skilful hand. And if
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:49088:194"/>
the Caruncle ſwel and ſtop the Paſſage neceſſity wil conſtrain you to uſe the Catheter to draw away the Urine, although there be danger leſt the part diſturbed ſhould ſwel more. But you muſt firſt make uſe of Revulſions, by bleeding, vomiting, and Repellers to the Privities, to take away the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamation of the Caruncle, that way may be made for the Urine.</p>
                     <p>If ſuppreſſion of the Urine come from thick flegm, firſt it is good to purge with a Bolus made of Diaphoenicon and Rhubarb, and then to give Turpentine often with Pouder of Liquoris; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a Decoction of opening Roots, with Oxymel, or Syrupus Bizantinus; not omitting in the mean while, Clyſters, Fomentations, and Baths, that mollifie and open. And all thoſe things will be proper which were propounded for the diſſolving and expelling of the Stone.</p>

                        <hi>Chap. 9.</hi> Of <hi>Dyſuria,</hi> or Scalding of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine.</head>
                     <p>BY the word <hi>Dyſuria,</hi> we underſtand all painful piſſing, which the Modern Writers call Scalding of the Urine. Many Authors make it all one with the Strangury, becauſe there is painful piſſing; but they will have it differ from Dyſuria in this only, but becauſe in Dyſuria there is a greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Urine made, than in Strangury, which is therefore called piſſing by drops. But we had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Inſtruction ſake, call that Strangury which is piſſing little, without pain, and put them in one Chapter, becauſe they muſt be cured both the ſame way, and to treat here of all painful piſling under the name of Dyſuria, being they come all of the ſame Cauſes, and are cured by the ſame Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines.</p>
                     <p>The immediate Cauſe of painful piſſing, is a ſolution of continuity in the Sphincter Muſcle, or the paſſage of the Bladder: and therefore whatſoever can cauſe a wound in thoſe parts, may cauſe heat of Urine.</p>
                     <p>The moſt uſual Cauſe is ſharpneſs of Urine, ſomtimes without mixture of other Humors, which is cauſed by a hot diſtemper of the Bowels, or of the whol Body, or by eating of hot and ſharp Meats; but it often comes by mixture of hot and ſharp Humors, as Choller and ſalt Flegm. Somtimes mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter coming from the Reins or Bladder, being ulcerated, may cauſe ſuch a ſharpneſs of Urine. Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a white Humor like Milk comes plentifully forth with the Urine, and cauſeth ſcalding, which is commonly thought to be Matter from the Reins; but <hi>Sennertus</hi> denies it for this Reaſon, For if all the Reins were turned into Matter, they could not afford ſo much as is many times voided at once, every day for a week together. And he ſuppoſeth that it comes from an evil Concoction, firſt of the Stomach, then of the Liver, becauſe the error of the firſt Concoction cannot be mended in the ſecond, hence the Chylus, and then the Blood remains crude, not freed from its Salt and Tartar-like parts, which ought to be ſeparated in the firſt Concoction, and they being after ſucked into the Reins and ſent to the Bladder, cauſe pain in piſſing. He ſaith that he was brought to be of this Judgment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a Learned man, who was troubled ſome weeks with heat of Urine, which he voided plentifully with half an Urinal ful of ſuch white Matter, was (when nothing elſe could aſſwage his violent pains) cured only with drinking of Sack.</p>
                     <p>Alſo a ſtone in the Bladder, if it ſtrike againſt the Neck of it in time of piſſing, cauſeth pain; and alſo large Gravel which grates upon the paſſage of the Urine.</p>
                     <p>Alſo Inflamation, or Ulcer of thoſe parts, cauſeth heat of Urine, becauſe the ſence is more quick at that time, and though the Urine be wel tempered, it is troubleſom; as we ſee externally how the leaſt touch is offenſive to a ſore place. So in a Gonorrhoea, as long as the Paraſtates are inflamed, there is a continual heat of Urine.</p>
                     <p>The Knowledg of this Diſeaſe is evident, for the Patient is forced to roar ſomtimes with pain. But you muſt diſtinguiſh the Signs of the Cauſes thus:</p>
                     <p>If it come from ſharpneſs of Urine, it wil be thin and high colored, ſomtimes like fire, or there wil be a viſible mixture of Choller, Flegm, or Matter; the Bowels wil be diſtempered, or the Patient hath eaten hot and ſharp meats, and endured great heat.</p>
                     <p>The Stone and Inflamation of thoſe parts are known by their proper Signs.</p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſtick. This Diſeaſe of it ſelf, is not dangerous, but very painful: and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the cauſe, it is ſomtimes hard to be cured, eſpecially in old men, which if they be decrepit, die thereof; and in all ages, if it continue long, it ulcerateth the neck of the Bladder.</p>
                     <p>The Cure is, firſt by taking away the Cauſe. And therefore if it come from the Stone, Inflamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Ulcer, you muſt cure them according to the Rules in their proper Chapters. But theſe things after mentioned, wil be good to allay the Symptome.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="398" facs="tcp:49088:195"/>They who have it from the ſharpneſs of Urine mixed with hot Humors, are to be cured by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines following.</p>
                     <p>And firſt, Phlebotomy is good to correct the diſtemper of the Liver and other parts. This muſt be often, according to the Plethory and Inflamation; firſt from the right Arm, to evacuate and revel the Matter; and after in the lower Veins, to derive it from the part affected; for which cauſe, <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> who followed him, do command the lower Veins to be opened in Diſeaſes of all parts beneath the Reins.</p>
                     <p>Purging alſo is good, of mild and gentle things, that cool, leſt the heat be encreaſed. Therefore do not give any thing but a Bolus of Caſſia alone, and indeed that is beſt. But you may make it cooler if you add the Pulp of Tamarinds. Or you may mix it with the Decoction of Lettice, Purſlain, and Mallow Tops, and give it many daies together, that the ſharp Humors may be brought back from the part by ſtool. But if you deſire to purge more by reaſon of the plenty of Humors, uſe this following:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Lettice, Purſlain, Plantane, and Mallow tops, of each half a handful: Tamarinds half an ounce: yellow Myrobalans one dram: boyl them to ſix ounces, and add to it ſtrained, one ounce of Caſſia: ſtrain it again, and then add one dram and an half of Rhubarb infuſed in Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice Water, with yellow Sanders, Manna, and Syrup of Roſes, of each one ounce. Make a Potion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In an old Dyſury, the purging Opiate preſcribed in the Ulcer of the Bladder, is very good.</p>
                     <p>A gentle Vomit is excellent, for it revelleth from that part affected, and hinders thoſe inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences which uſe to come by purging: Therefore give it once or twice in a week to them that can vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit eaſily.</p>
                     <p>By often Clyſters, the ſharp Humors are not only brought to the Guts, and ſent out by degrees, but the diſtemper of the parts is qualified.</p>
                     <p>They are made thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Marſh-mallow Roots one ounce: Mallows, Violets, and Lettice, of each one handful: Water Lillies, and clenſed Barley, of each one pugil: boyl them to a pint: Diſſolve in the ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Caſſia new drawn one ounce: one Egg: and two ounces of Oyl of Violets.

                     <p>The Mucilages of Seeds of Marſh-mallows, Quinces, and Foenugreek, may be mixed with Clyſters to aſſwage pain.</p>
                     <p>But Clyſters of Milk only, or mixed with the aforeſaid things, uſe to be ſo powerful to allay heat and pain, that we have known ſome of long continuance cured by them alone, and a Bath, whereof we wil ſpeak hereafter.</p>
                     <p>Experience hath found out many things good to be taken at the mouth, to allay heat, and to correct the diſtemper of the parts. The chief are theſe following:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Water Purſlain, Lettice, Roſes, and Water Lillies, of each one ounce: Syrup of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets and Water-lillies, of each ſix drams: Sal prunellae one dram. Mix them for a Julep, repeat it often.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Marſh-mallow Roots one ounce: Lettice, Endive, Purſlain, and Mallow tops, of each one handful: Melone, Guord, Mallows, Lettice, and white Poppy ſeeds, of each three drams: Jujubes and Sebeſtens, of each ſix pair: Violets, Roſes, and Water-lillies, of each one pugil: boyl them in a pint and an half. Diſſolve in the ſtraining, Syrup of Violets, Jujubes, and Poppies, of each one ounce and an half: Sal prunellae half an ounce: make a Julep for four Doſes to be taken twice in a day.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Emulſions alſo may be uſed although they be Diuretick, becauſe they cool and clenſe the paſſage of the Bladder. Make them thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the four great cold Seeds, and white Poppy Seeds, of each three drams: ſweet Almonds blanched and infuſed in cold Water half an ounce: beat them in a ſtone Morter, powring on by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees the Decoction of Barley, Liquoris, Purſlain, and Mallow tops one pint and an half: make an Emulſion for three Doſes, adding to each Doſe one ounce of the Syrup of Violets, and one dram of Lapis prunellae, and if the pain be great add a little Syrup of Poppies, and one dram of Gum Arabick in pouder, or the Syrup of Marſh-mallows, according to</hi> Fernelius, <hi>or of Muci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You may make Broths thus:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Marſh-mallow Roots half an ounce: Mallows one handful: Liquoris half an ounce: Quince ſeeds one dram: boyl them with Chicken Broth: make it often.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Whey of Goats Milk is very good given in great draughts, as we ſaid in the hot diſtemper of the Liver.</p>
                     <p>And if there be no Feaver, you may with more profit give Milk by it ſelf, becauſe it doth not only clenſe, but allay pain, and temper the ſharpneſs of the Humors.</p>

And Curat. 59. he ſaith that one who had a Dyſury, after he had voided a ſtone was cured by the ſame in three daies. The Conſerve of Marſh-mallow ſlowers, is of the ſame or greater Vertue.</p>
                     <p>Some commend the Troches of Winter Cherries given with convenient Liquor, the quantity of a dram becauſe they are Diuretick, abate ſharpneſs and pain.</p>
                     <p>When the pain is very great, it is good to put the Yard when you piſs, into warm Milk, or a Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Mallows and white Poppy ſeeds, or warm Water only.</p>
                     <p>A ſmal Decoction of Mallows with Syrup of Violets and Conſerve of Roſes, is good for ordinary Drink.</p>
                     <p>You may alſo make Injections into the paſſage of the Bladder, of Milk, or of an Emulſion of cold Seeds, Plantane Water, or Whey, with the Water of a white of an Egg beaten, or one ſcruple of the Troches of Winter Cherries.</p>
                     <p>External Medicines are alſo good, as Baths, half Baths, Fomentations to the Privities made of cool Herbs, Liniments of Oyl of Roſes, Water Lillies, Unguent of Roſes, <hi>Galens</hi> cooling Oyntment, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puleon with Camphire, and the Mucilage of Fleabane made with Plantane Water. Alſo you muſt apply Epithems that cool to the Reins and Liver, and the aforeſaid Liniments, and the things mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned formerly for the ſame.</p>
                     <p>When ſharp and chollerick Humors flow from the Liver, you may derive by an Iſſue in the right Leg, or by opening the Hemorrhoids, which is very good in al diſeaſes of the Reins and Bladder; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> Aph. 11.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hoſe are called Womens Diſeaſes which are proper to them only, and come from the defect of that part which is diſtinct in them from men, <hi>viz.</hi> the Womb; of which <hi>Democritus</hi> in his Letter to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaid that it was the cauſe of ſix hundred miſeries, and innumerable Calamities. But we to lay down thoſe Diſeaſes of the Womb which are moſt uſual, will divide them thus: Some come from the Veſſels, and ſome from the Body of the Womb, or Cavity; others are in respect of its chief and nobleſt act of Generation. From the diſtemper of the Veſſels of the Womb, and the preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cauſes, come <hi>Chloroſis,</hi> or green Sickneſs, ſtoppage of the Terms, immoderate Flux, the Whites, Rage of the Womb, and the Mother. In the Cavity of the Womb are, Inflamations, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers, Scir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus, Cancer, Gangrene, Dropſie, coming forth, and ſhutting up thereof: theſe may hinder Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration but by accident. The Diſeaſes which are in reſpect of Conception, Breeding, and Bringing forth, are, Barrenneſs acute and Chronical Diſeaſes of Women with Child, Abortion, difficult bringing forth, dead Child, Secundine retained, immoderate flux, or ſuppreſſion of blood, and the acute Diſeaſes of women in Child-bed. All which Diſeaſes we will ſpeak of in as few words as the dignity of the Matter will permit.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THis Diſeaſe by <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> is called <hi>Chloroſis;</hi> by the Modern Phyſitians, the white Feaver, the Virgins Diſeaſe, the Pale color of Virgins, the white Jaundice, but vulgarly the Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſickneſs.</p>
                     <p>It may be defined thus: An evil habit of Body from the Obſtruction of the Veins of the Liver, Spleen, and Meſentery, and eſpecially of thoſe which are about the Womb, which is accompanied with a heavineſs or unwildineſs of the whol Body, beating of the heart, difficulty of breathing, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of evil Food, and the like.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="401" facs="tcp:49088:196"/>This Diſeaſe depends immediately upon the Obſtruction of the parts in the lower Belly, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of thoſe Veins which are about the Womb, whereby the free paſſage of Blood to the Womb is hindered, which abounding in Virgins when they begin to have their Terms, and being hindered of its Natural courſe by thoſe Obſtructions, runs to the upper parts, and oppreſſeth the Heart, Liver, Spleen, Diaphragma, or Midriff, and other parts, deſtroyes their Natural heat, ſtops the Veſſels; hence is there an evil Concoction in the Bowels, and from thence their Body is ful of Crudities, which being carried forth, make an evil Habit. In other parts they produce divers Symptomes in the Hypochondria, a ſwelling of the Bowels, by which the Midriff is oppreſſed, which cauſeth ſhortneſs of breath. And becauſe groſs blood and wind are carried by the Branches of the hollow Vein, and great Artery into the Heart, which contend againſt them for fear of Suffocation, by often moving of its Arteries, there is a palpitation of the Heart, and often a beating in the Temples. Beſides, they have in this Diſeaſe a loathing of meat, becauſe the Stomach is filled with crude Excrements by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of its evil Concoction and diſtribution: which excrements having gotten an evil quality by a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar kind of corruption, cauſe a deſire of evil meats, and things not ordained for nouriſhment, as Salt, Spices, Chalk, Coals, Aſhes, and the like, which Diſeaſe is called <hi>Pica Malacia,</hi> or ſtrange Longing, which we have at large ſpoken of in its proper place, among the Diſeaſes of the Stomach.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes of the Obſtructions in the Veins of the Womb, and the Hypochondria, are thick, ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and crude Humors, coming commonly from evil Diet: for theſe Virgins drink great draughts of Water at bed-time, or in the morning faſting; or eat Vinegar, Herbs, unripe Fruits, Snow, or Ice; hence it is that they loſe their Natural heat, and there is abundance of crude Excrements. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſleep too much, or are very idle, as Seamſters, which by ſitting ſtil al day are very cold. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers watch too much, and uſe unſeaſonable exerciſe, as dauncing preſently after meat, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing with their Sweet-hearts all night. Moreover, they have great cares and diſturbances of mind by which the Concoction is deſtroyed, and the Body filled with evil Juyce.</p>
                     <p>The Knowledge of this Diſeaſe is eaſie from the Symptomes following:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The Face and all the Body is pale and white, ſomtimes of a Lead color, blew, or green; for crude, flegmatick, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>erous Humors abounding, and being carried to the habit of the body, do diſcolor it; and if Choller or Melancholly be mixed with that flegm, the color wil be yellowiſh, greeniſh or blew.</p>
                     <p>The Second is, Swelling in the Face and Eye-lids, eſpecially after ſleep, becauſe the motive heat being cloſed and contracted at night, raiſed more vapors than it could diſcuſs. The Leggs alſo and Feet, eſpecially about the Ankles, and the whol Body is looſe and ſoft by reaſon of the abundance of flegm.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Heavineſs and Idleneſs in the whol Body, a lazy ſtretching forth of the Leggs from the Humors being fallen down.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, There is difficult breathing, eſpecially when they move themſelves, or go up Hils or ſteep places, then the thick blood grows warm, and thence ariſe many vapors, which cauſe ſhortneſs of breathing.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, There is Palpitation of the Heart and beating of the Arteries in the Temples when the Body is exerciſed, by reaſon of the ſame evaporation, which is raiſed from thick Humors heated by Exerciſe.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, There is often a great Head-ach, and ſomtimes in the hinder part of the Head, when the Womb ſuffers; but in the Forehead when the vapors ariſe moſt from the Hypochondria.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, The Pulſe is ſwift and quick, as if they were in a Feaver, and therefore this Diſeaſe is called the white Feaver, by reaſon of the quickneſs of the Pulſe, which is ſo for this reaſon; The vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal faculty being weak, makes the Pul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e little, therefore Nature ſupplies the ſmalneſs of it with often beating.</p>
                     <p>Eightly, The ſleep is very ſound, they ſleep til midnight, except they be forcibly awaked; and this is from many thick vapors which ariſe from the filthy flegm.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, There is a great loathing of wholſom meat, by reaſon of the great collection of Crudities in the Stomach and parts adjacent; and theſe Humors when they grow worſe, cauſe the Pica, or longing for things that are not to be eaten.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, When the evil encreaſeth, and the Obſtructions are multiplied, the Terms ſtop, which ſhews the Diſeaſe to be at the height, and confirmed.</p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſtick: That Diſeaſe commonly is not dangerous, and continueth a long time.</p>
                     <p>But if it be too much neglected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſuffered to take root, ſo that the Nouriſhment is hindered, there follow great Diſeaſes of the Natural parts, as Scirrhous and other Tumors, and corruption of the ſubſtance of them, which cauſe death, by Dropſies, long Feavers, and the like.</p>
                     <p>When the Diſeaſe is leſs, and comes only from the Obſtruction of the Veins of the Womb, in yong women it is cured by Marriage.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="402" facs="tcp:49088:197"/>Women that have long been in this Diſeaſe, either are barren, or their Children are diſeaſed, and weak.</p>
                     <p>There is great hope of recovery when the Terms keep their ordinary courſe, and their due quantity and quality.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of this Diſeaſe is by opening Obſtructions, by emptying of the filthy Humors from the whol Body, and correcting the diſtemper of the Bowels, and ſtrengthening of them.</p>
                     <p>The Obſtructions are taken away by the Medicines which were mentioned in the Cure of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of the Liver and Spleen, adding ſome things which reſpect the Womb, and that are more proper to open thoſe Veins.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then, give a purging Medicine agreeable to the Patients temper, made of gentle things, to clenſe the firſt Region only, and a Clyſter before it, if the Body be bound.</p>
                     <p>Then open a Vein, if the Diſeaſe be not very old, and the Maid very much without blood, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to an evil habit. Let the Vein of the Arm be opened firſt, although the Terms be ſtopped; for if then you draw blood from the Foot, the Obſtructions of the Veins of the Womb will be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by their fulneſs. And if the Liver be moſt ſtopped, take blood from the right Arm; if the Spleen from the left.</p>
                     <p>After you have bled ſufficiently, you muſt give an ordinary Purge, by way of an Apozeme, ſuch as was preſcribed in the Cure of the Obſtructions of the Liver. To which you may add ſome Herbs that are proper to the Womb, as Mugwort, Feaverfew, Peny-royal; and if the Spleen be ſtopped you may add proper things for that, as Capar barks, Ceterach, or Spleenwort, Harts-tongue. It the temper be Chollerick, and there be ſigns of a hot and dry Liver, you muſt take all the hot ſimples out of the Apozeme, and put in cold openers inſtead thereof.</p>
                     <p>For the more delicate Virgins, inſtead of Apozemes, you may give the Broths preſcribed in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid Cure of the Liver, and change the ſimples as we ſaid of the Apozeme.</p>
                     <p>In the mean while you may uſe Fomentations and Liniments preſcribed in the ſame Chapter, not only to the Liver, but to the Spleen and Womb.</p>

                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> Obſtructions, which are of ſuch force that we have known ſomtimes the Terms to begin to flow at the third or fourth bathing, when they have formerly been long ſtopped.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Marſh-mallow Roots, Lilly Roots, Elicampane, Briony, wild Cucumer, of each two pound: Mallows, Violets, Mercury, Penyroyal, Feaverfew, Balm, of each four handfuls: Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed and Fenugreek beaten, of two ounces: boyl them in ſpring Water for a Bath. Let her go into it warm twice in a day, not ſweating, long before and after meat, for two daies, renewing each day the Decoction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The day after the laſt Bath, if the Terms be ſtopped, let the lower Veins be opened, and take away three ounces of blood: and this may be done twice or thrice at that time, in which the Terms uſed to flow. Or if they never did appear at that time in which the Patient is moſt aſſlicted.</p>
                     <p>After theſe Medicines to ſtrengthen the Bowels, and to wear away the reliques of the Obſtructions, an opening and ſtrengthening Opiate wil do very wel, deſcribed in the place mentioned; to which you may add two drams of <hi>Foecula Brioniae,</hi> and as much of Salt of Mugwort.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe ſomtimes the Obſtructions are ſo great that they wil not preſently be cured, you muſt make a Magiſtral Syrup of the Ingredients to the Apozeme before mentioned, with an encreaſe of the purging Medicines in quantity, and let the Patient take it twice or thrice in a month.</p>
                     <p>The ordinary Pils mentioned in the Cure of the ſtoppage of the Liver, are moſt excellent; to which you may add the Medicines there mentioned, of Tartar, Vitriol, and Steel.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Zacutus Luſitanus,</hi> Obſerv. 99. Lib. 2. reports of a certain Woman which had the Green-ſickneſs ten yeers with ſtoppage of her Terms, and could not be cured with divers opening and purging Medicines, and ſome made of Steel, that he cured her with nothing but Conſerve of Mugwort, given thirty daies together, drinking after it the diſtilled Water of Savin, in which Rhubarb had been a whol night inſuſed.</p>
                     <p>The ſame <hi>Zacutus,</hi> Obſerv. 117. Lib. 3. tels of a Virgin, which eating much Salt every day, felin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Diarrhoea of Choller, mixed with a Conſumption, which he cured after general Medicines, with Goats Milk ſteeled and cold things applied to the Liver.</p>
                     <p>In the greateſt Obſtructions, an Iſſue made in the right or left Legg, as the Liver or Spleen is affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, is very good.</p>
                     <p>After the Obſtructions are opened, you muſt diſeuſs the flegm like ſerous humors that remain in the Veins, and in the habit of the Body by ſweats; for which you muſt uſe the Decoction of Guaja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum in cold Conſtitutions, or of China and Sarſa in thoſe that are hot, for fifteen or twenty daies; with this Caution, That every fourth or fifth day, you give a Purge to clenſe the Bowels of Humors which cannot be ſent forth by ſweat; and which if they continue wil grow hard and putrefie, and be the occaſion of Feavers, and other Diſeaſes. For this Purpoſe you may uſe Brimſtone Baths, both for drink and bathing: for by the drinking thereof, when the paſſages are firſt open by the Medicines
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:49088:197"/>
aforeſaid, the Humor that is contained in the firſt and ſecond Region of the Body, is clenſed and ſent forth by the belly and urine; and the third Region is clenſed by ſweating in them.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly, Copulation, if it may be legally done, after the uſe of opening Medicines, is very good; for thereby the Natural heat is ſtirred up in parts Natural, by which the Veſſels of the Womb are much enlarged. And Experience teacheth, that ſomtimes theſe Women have their Terms the firſt night after Marriage, and that others who in good health, have them before their accuſtomed time.</p>

                        <hi>Chap. 2.</hi> Of the ſtoppage of the Terms.</head>
                     <p>THe Terms are ſaid to be ſtopped, when in a Woman ripe of Age, which gives not ſuck, and is not with Child, there is a ſeldom, ſmal, or no evacuation of blood by the Womb, which uſed to be every month.</p>
                     <p>The cauſe of this ſtoppage is either in the Womb, or in its Veſſels, or in the blood which comes, or ought to come that way.</p>
                     <p>Divers Diſeaſes of the Womb may cauſe this Diſeaſe; namely, a cold Diſtemper, and dry, which thickeneth and bindeth the Body of the Womb; or a hot and dry diſtemper by drying the part, or burning up the nouriſhment thereof, from whence come evil humors, which being faſtened in the part, hinder the Terms from flowing. Alſo the Organical Diſeaſes of thoſe parts, as inflamation, or ſcirrhus, the turning of the inward mouth thereof, or compreſſion from the Tumors of the parts adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, or the Omentum or Caul growing too thick. The thickneſs of the Womb it ſelf, Ulcer, or Scars, which they leave, or from the tearing of the Cotyledones, or Mouths of the Veſſels, in a great Abortion.</p>
                     <p>The Veſſels of the Womb do often ſuffer Obſtruction, which is the chief cauſe of ſtopping of the Terms, and they come from cold and thick Humors: ſomtimes there is a ſuppreſſion of thoſe Veins by binding of them, and that is from the parts adjacent being ſtretched and ſwoln, as we ſaid in the binding or cloſing of the Womb.</p>
                     <p>The blood offending either in quantity, quality, or motion, may be cauſe of the obſtruction of the Courſes. It offends in quantity, when it is too much or too little; too much, when it ſtretcheth out the Veins, ſo that they cannot contract themſelves to expel it; as in the bladder when it is too full of Urine, it cannot contract it ſelf to ſend it forth; too little, when the Body hath not blood e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to nouriſh it.</p>
                     <p>The blood offends in quality, when it is thicker, and more ſlimy of its own Nature, by reaſon of the cold diſtemper of the Liver, and other parts, or from the mixture of thick and flegmatick or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanchollick humors, from whence commonly Obſtructions come.</p>
                     <p>The blood offends in motion, when it paſſeth other waies, as by the Noſe, vomiting, ſpittle, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, hemorrhoids, and many other parts. I ſaw a Maid who had a Sore in her head, which opened every month, and bled plentifully; and we have ſeen many that have ſent forth blood at fixed times by their Lungs; and this evacuation was inſtead of a Menſtrual flux.</p>
                     <p>The external Cauſes, are cold and dry Air, Northern winds, often going into cold water, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the time of their flux; too little or two much meat, either too thick and cold, or too aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent; alſo hot things, as too much Salt and Spice by drying of the ſubſtance of the Liver, and other parts, and by drying up the blood, by which it groweth thick, and fit to ſtop; violent exerciſe and watchings, which do conſume the blood; long ſleep, and idleneſs, which do weaken the Natural heat, and cauſe Crudities; too long retaining of Excrements; by uſual bleeding at the Noſe, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhoids, Diarrhoea, and other evacuations by vomit, urine, or ſweat; and laſtly, great paſſions of the mind, anger, ſudden fear, ſorrow, jealouſie, and the like.</p>
                     <p>The Knowledge of this is to be taken from the Patients relation; but becauſe it comes either from Natural or Preternatural Cauſes, we ſhal lay down ſome diſtinguiſhing ſigns, left the Phyſitian be deceived by Women that would diſſemble their being with Child, and left he ſhould raſhly preſcribe Medicines to provoke Terms to Women with Child.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, If they be with Child, they have commonly their Natural Complexion; but others are pale and ill colored.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Symptomes which Women with Child have at the firſt, do dayly decreaſe; but in others ſtoppage of the Terms, by how much the longer the Terms ſtop, by ſo much the more the Symptomes encreaſe.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, In Women with Child, after the third Month, you may perceive the Scituation and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Infant, by laying your hand upon the inferior Belly; in others there is a Tumor to be felt,
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:49088:198"/>
but it is oedematous or flegmatick, not hard; neither is it proportionable to the Womb.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, If a wiſe Midwife touch the inward Mouth of the Womb, it will not be ſo cloſe ſhut as in women with Child, but rather hard, and contracted, and full of pain.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, Women with Child are commonly merry, and little diſturbed; but when the Terms are otherwiſe ſtopped, they are ſad and ſorrowful.</p>
                     <p>The Signs of the Cauſes are theſe:</p>
                     <p>The faults of the Womb which uſe to cauſe ſtoppage of the Terms, ſhal be laid down in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chapters; but the greateſt part of them is found out by touching, ſeeing, and relation of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients.</p>
                     <p>The Obſtruction and ſtraightneſs of the Veſſels of the Womb are known by pain in the Loyns, and parts adjacent, eſpecially in the time the Terms ſhould flow, and if any thing flow at that time, it is ſlimy, white, and blackiſh. Now the Diſeaſes of the adjacent parts, which may ſhut the mouth of the Womb, or the Veins, will appear by their proper ſigns.</p>
                     <p>You may know the abounding of blood in the Veins, by the ſwelling of the Veins in the Thighs and Arms, eſpecially if the Woman be fleſhy and red, and have fed high. You may ſuppoſe there is want of blood, if the Woman be fat, if ſhe have had a long Feaver went before, or loathing of meat. The evil quality of the blood is known by the evil habit of the Body, by the diſtemper of the Liver, and other parts, and eſpecially by the blood it ſelf, if you can ſee ſome of it. The prepoſterous mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the blood, when it flows another way, is manifeſt of it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>As to the Prognoſtick. The ſtoppage of the Terms is very dangerous, and many great diſeaſes come thereof, and ſome in the Womb it ſelf, as ſwellings, impoſthumes, and Ulcers; others in the whol Body, and divers parts thereof, as Feavers, Obſtructions, evil Habits, Loathing, Dropſie, Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach, Cough, ſhort Breathing, Fainting, ſore Eyes, Madneſs, Melancholly, Headach, Joynt-gout, and the like. <hi>Hippocrates, Lib.</hi> 1. of Womens Diſeaſes, hath ſhewed the encreaſe of Diſeaſes from the ſtopping of the Terms, in theſe words. <hi>The third month after the ſtoppage of the Terms, they begin to feel ſuffocations, or ſhortneſs of breath, with horrors, heavineſs of the Loyns, and ſomtimes a Feaver.</hi> But if it laſt long, the Belly grows hard, they piſs much, they loath meat, and watch much, they grate their Teeth in ſleep; and if they continue longer ſtopped, the pains will be greater; but in the ſixth month, that Diſeaſe which was formerly curable, will be then incurable: then ſhe wil be troubled in mind, and faint, vomit flegm, thirſty, the Belly about the Privities will be pained, there will be a Feaver, and the Body bound, and the Urine ſtopped, the Back will ach, and ſhe will ſtammer. Afterwards the Leggs, Feet, and Belly will ſwell, and the Urine be red, bloody, and pain over all the Body, eſpecially the Neck and Back-bone, and Groyns, and ſo they die of a Dropſie. Thus far <hi>Hippocrates.</hi> But here is a doubt, becauſe the Author ſaith, That in the ſixt month the Diſeaſe is incurable, when Experience teacheth the contrary: and <hi>Hippocrates</hi> himſelf, 4. Epid. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports that a Maid who had her Terms ſtopped for ſeven Yeers, was reſtored to health by the return of them. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> may be reconciled to himſelf, by ſaying, That after ſix months the Diſeaſe is incurable, when the Terms are in the Body or Cavity of the Womb, becauſe there they putrefie, and come to ſuppuration, as in the After-birth, or Blood retained. But this is not to be underſtood of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Suppuration.</p>
                     <p>That Stoppage is leaſt dangerous which comes from plenty of good Blood, or fat, bleeding, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Evacuations, becauſe thoſe Cauſes may eaſily be removed.</p>
                     <p>That is harder to be cured which comes from heavineſs of Humors, Obſtruction of Veſſels, or ſtraitneſs, becauſe that ſtubborn Humor, getting into the innermoſt paſſages, cannot be got forth but by long pains and Medicines, which Women are very unwilling to receive.</p>
                     <p>That ſtoppage which cometh from the diſtemper only of the Womb, is worſt, becauſe the part being hurt by propriety is hard to be cured by reaſon of the continual flux of Humors, which the part is diſpoſed to receive, and therefore is called the Jakes of the whol Body.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of this Diſeaſe is divers, according to the variety of the Cauſes. And firſt, if it come from too much blood, you muſt abate the quantity by Phlebotomy in the Arm; for if the lower veins ſhould be firſt opened, the blood would be drawn more to the Womb, where it would make greater obſtruction and diſtention of Veſſels, and break them, or cauſe Inflamation of the Womb.</p>
                     <p>After the Plethory, or abundance of blood is taken away, you muſt draw the blood down by ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the lower Veins about the time that the Patient uſed before to be clenſed, as alſo by Frictions, Ligatures, Cupping-glaſſes, dry, and with Scarrification.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things done, you muſt relax and ſoften the parts of the Womb with Fomentations, and Baths, and moiſtening Unguents; which if they cannot maſter the Diſeaſe, you may give Hyſterical Purges, and ſuch as do properly provoke the Terms, which we ſhal after deſcrhibe, cuſing the mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt.</p>
                     <p>If want of Blood be the cauſe, as after long Feavers, great Evacuations, and Extenuation of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, you muſt not provoke them till you have uſed Reſtoratives, and blood be renewed, and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:49088:198"/>
is the cauſe of extenuation be removed; which things being done, the Terms do commonly flow of themſelves; which if they do not, but Nature forgets her office, you muſt open the inferior Veins, and uſe the Medicines afore mentioned, ſo that you take not away too much blood, becauſ the ſtrength is little, and leſt the Patient fal into a Conſumption. But here you muſt diligently mark, That every extenuation of the body doth not ſignifie want of blood, but only after great evacuations &amp; conſuming Cauſes; for it comes to paſs ſomtimes, that the Terms ſtopt in the Veins get an evil quality, which makes the blood unfit to nouriſh: hence comes leanneſs, although the Veins be filled with much bad blood, and then large bleeding is very good, as <hi>Galen</hi> confirms, Comment. 3. in Lib. 6. Epid. I (ſaith he) <hi>cured a Woman that had her Courſes ſtopped eight months, when ſhe was lean by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much blood; as alſo others. But what happened to that famous Woman was remarkable; I opened a Vein when other Phyſitians feared the ſucceſs, and were againſt me, ſaying that it muſt hurt her, not only becauſe ſhe was lean, but alſo becauſe ſhe had no ſtomach to eat. But theſe yong Phyſitians had a more Sophiſtical way, to obſerve what happened to the Patients, and to neglect the affects and Cauſes, which are the ground of Cure. I took (to my beſt remembrance) the firſt day, a pint and an half of blood from the woman; the next day one pint; the third, not above half a pint, or eight ounces.</hi> Thus <hi>Galen.</hi> By which it is manifeſt, That from lean women, of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, you may take a great quantity of blood, although the women of our Age will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it.</p>
                     <p>The ſtoppage of the Courſes comes from a prepoſterous motion of the blood, when it is ſent forth by the Noſe, Vomiting, ſpitting, or Hemorrhoids, and the like: The Cure is by repelling it from thoſe parts, and bringing it to the paſſage of the Womb. Firſt (while they bleed) you muſt waſh Arms, Head, and Face, with cold Water, and keep them from the uſe of thoſe parts, eſpecially loud ſpeaking; then you muſt open a Vein beneath. Two or three daies before they bleed, apply Cupping-glaſſes to the Thighs and Calves of the Leggs, ſomtimes dry, ſomtimes with ſcarrification; by provoking the Hemorrhoids, by Frictions, Ligatures, Walking, Fomentations, Baths of ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Herbs, Oyntments, Peſſaries, Clyſters for the Womb, and the like, which ſhall be deſcribed hereafter. The uſe of a Natural Bath is principally commended, if it be of brimſtone or Bitumen; into which let the Patient go often, long before, and after meat, not above the Waſt, and at the ſame time, let the upper parts be cooled with a Fan, leſt by the heat of the Bath, they alſo wax warm.</p>
                     <p>If Blood flow from the Hemorrhoids being diverted from the Womb, it is hard to be cured; for if you uſe Attractions to the lower parts, they will go by ſtool, and if you uſe Aſtringents below, they will repel from the womb by the neerneſs of parts. Therefore there is no way of Cure but this, That after you have uſed Attractive things beneath, you apply Topical Medicines to the Womb, which may draw the Humor now in motion, more unto the Womb.</p>
                     <p>But that Suppreſſion of the Courſes is of all other moſt frequent, which is cauſed by obſtruction of the Veins of the Womb. The Cure whereof, is in a manner the ſame which hath been propounded in the Caſe of Pale and diſcolored Virgins, ſome things only being added, which do more ſpecifically reſpect the Womb.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place therefore, All thoſe things may be uſed in their order one after another, which have been preſcribed for the Cure of the Green-ſickneſs. And for the moſt part it falls out that the Obſtructions of the Bowels being opened, the Courſes flow of their own accord: whoſe Eruption may yet be furthered by the uſe of ſuch things as cauſe the Humors to work downwards; as opening of the Inferior Veins, about that time when the Courſes have been wont to come down; or inſtead of Blood-letting, Cupping-Glaſſes faſtened unto the Hips and Ankles, both without and with Scarrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, frictions of the ſame parts, and painful bindings.</p>
                     <p>If the Diſeaſe be ſo rebellious as not to give way to the former Remedies, we muſt proceed to ſuch as by a proper and ſpecifical vertue, do move the Courſes, which are wont to be uſed under divers forms. And in the firſt place, moſt effectual Pouders, and grateful to the Taſt, are thus made:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Cinnamon and Amber, of each one ſcruple: Saffron half a ſcruple. Mix all, and make them into a Pouder, to be taken divers mornings one after another.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Pouder of the Roots of Madder, ſuch as Diers uſe, and Sugar Poudered, of each one ounce. Mix them, divide all into three parts; of which, give one at the time in which the Courſes ſhould flow, early in the morning in hot Wine, while the Patient is yet in her bed; wherein let her continue five hours, well covered with cloathes. If her courſes ſhall not flow the next courſe of the Moon, at the wonted time, give her the ſecond part: If yet they come not, give her the third part at the third return of the time of her Courſes.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Roots of round Birthwort half a dram: Savin Leaves dried one dram and an half: Dictamnus Cretenſis, and Troches of Mirrh, without Aſſafoetida, becauſe of the ſtrong ſmell, of each one dram: Elect Cinnamon two drams: white Sugar two ounces. Make all into a moſt fine Pouder, of which let her take two drams in the morning for certain daies together, with broth of red Vetches, wherein two drams of Cinnamon, and half a dram of Saffron have been boyled.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="406" facs="tcp:49088:199"/>Moſt excellent Pills are made after this manner:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Troches of Mirrh one dram: Caſtorium half a ſcruple. With Juyce of Mugwort make ſmal Pills.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Among familiar Medicines eaſily provided, are accounted the flowers of Lavender eaten with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney many daies together, or Conſerve of Mary-gold flowers, given to the quantity of two drams at a time.</p>
                     <p>The Blood of a wild Goat, and likewiſe of a tame one, hath mighty vertue to bring down the ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped Courſes according to that preparation and doſe propounded in our Cure of the Pleuriſie.</p>
                     <p>In hot Conſtitutions, Cream of Tartar uſed many daies together in Broth, or ſome Melancholly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driving Decoction, does further the Courſes ſtopped.</p>
                     <p>But the Pills of <hi>Montagnana</hi> are mightily praiſed, being thus compounded:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Troches of Mirrh one dram and an half: Parſley ſeed, Caſtorium, Cinnamon, of each one ſcruple: Musk ten grains. With Juyce of Smallage form all (being poudered) into twenty two Pills, gilt with Gold. Let her take two in the morning, or at her entrance into bed, for ſome daies together.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Madder Roots, and round Ariſtolochia, or Birthwort, of each three drams: Agarick and Cinnamon, of each one dram: Saffron one ſcruple: With Juyce of Mugwort, make a Maſs of Pills; whoſe doſe is one dram.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Old Leven is commended by many, the quantity of a Cheſnut, with the ſame quantity of Sugar, given three daies together. Yet it will do more good, if pouder of the Troches of Mirrh, Dictamnus, or ſome ſuch like be mixed therewith.</p>
                     <p>The moſt uſual and profitable Decoctions are made in this manner:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Roots of Parſley, and great Madder, of each two ounces: red Vetches four pugils: boyl them to a pint and an half. In the ſtrained Liquor boyl Cinnamon Pouder one dram: Saffron half a dram: Honey as much as ſhall ſuffice: mix them. Let her take ſix ounces warm, in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings twice a day, before her Courſes break forth, or when they begin to flow, if they flow but spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Roots of Smallage, Asparagus, Fennel, of each one ounce: Feaverfew, Maiden-hair, Nep, Peny-royal, of each one handful: Boyl all to a quart. To four ounces of the ſtraining, ad one ounce of Syrup of Mugwort. Let her drink it hot twice a day as before.</hi> Or,</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quercetanus</hi> in his <hi>Pharmacopoeia,</hi> doth exceedingly commend two Decoctions: the firſt of which is thus made:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Gromwelſeed, Annis ſeed, Miſſelto of the Oak, of each three drams:</hi> Dictamnus Creten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis <hi>one dram: Saffron one ſcruple. Beat what is to be beaten, and ſteep all in rich white Wine twenty four hours: afterwards let them boyl a little. Of this Decoction give the Patient four ounces.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The other Decoction is thus deſcribed:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>the whol Spleen or Milt of an Ox: cut it in bits, and put it in a capacious Glaſs, ſo as it may fill the Glaſs half full, adding of Cinnamon groſly poudered, one ounce: Cloves half an ounce: Saffron two drams: of the beſt white Wine as much as ſhall ſuffice only to moiſten all that is in the Glaſs. Let the Glaſs cloſely ſtopped, be put into a</hi> Balneum Mariae <hi>exceeding hot, ſo that it boyl twenty four hours together, until the Spleen ſhall be boyled and conſumed into little crums, and there remains a great quantity of Broth excellently well boyled, and of a very fragrant ſmel; of which let the Patient take in the marning four ounces, continuing the ſame for four or five daies, when her Courſes ought to flow.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Diſtilled Waters ought to be preferred before other Liquors, as being more pleaſant to the taſte: and becauſe of their ſubtil thinneſs of parts, they pierce more eaſily to the obſtructed Veſſels of the Womb.</p>
                     <p>The Preheminence above all the reſt, is by <hi>Mercatus, Rodericus a Caſtro,</hi> and <hi>Sennertus,</hi> given to this following:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>a Loaf almoſt as ſowr as Leaven, indifferently baked, and hot; take away the Cruſt, and add thereto, of Honey twelve ounces, Pounder of Nettle ſeeds, Carrot ſeeds, Amy, Annis and Fennel ſeeds, of each one dram: Troches of Gallia Moſchata, red Mirrh, of each one ſcruple: Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tula foetida, or ſtinking Fennel, half a dram. Infuſe all in three pints of the Decoction below de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, which is made of red French Beans, and red Vetches, of each half a pugil: Juniper ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries one ounce: Roots of Madder, Butchers Broom, wild Rhadiſh, Asparagus, Smallage, and

Parſley, of each two ounces: Green Germander one handful: Seeds of Amy, Annis, and Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, of each two ounces: Boil all according to Art. Then ſtil the liquor out in</hi> Balneo Mariae; <hi>of which give to the Patient two ounces early in the morning. Alſo there may be added Syrup of Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-hair, of Opening roots, of Mugwort. Alſo the Doſe may be augmented, the following daies, if the Stomach be not offended.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A Decoction of Guajacum or Saſſafras is good in flegmatick bodies, alſo Dictamnus Creticus may be added; taking the ſame twelve or fifteen daies without ſweating. <hi>Jacchinus</hi> relates an Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, writing upon the ninth of <hi>Rhaſis,</hi> Chap. 66. I boiled (ſaies he) the Indian wood, and added Dictamnus thereto. By which I procured both her Courſes, and Child-bearing to a Woman which had wanted her Courſes five years, and had been Barren.</p>

                     <p>In an old inveterate Diſeaſe, Iſſues made in the Legs may do very much good. For although <hi>Sennertus</hi> approves not of them, becauſe they rather derive from the Womb, and teach the humors which were wont to flow unto the Womb, to come rather that way, and hinder their inclinations to the Womb: Yet have they been found to do much good by the frequent experiences of <hi>Mercuria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, Varandaeus,</hi> and others. For by thoſe Iſſues the ſuperfluous humors are continually evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the Courſe of the humors is guided into the inferior parts. And the derivation of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous humors from the Womb, is ſo far from hindring the Flux of Courſes to the Womb; that it rather furthers the ſame, by making the Blood more pure, and more obedient to the command of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which with the Humors aforeſaid, is not drawn unto the Iſſues. And hereunto, that theſe Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, if they be not by theſe waies evacuated, being retained inthe Veins, they double the Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſo do augment the ſuppreſſion of Courſes. Howbeit, We are of opinion, that the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrual purgations being reſtored to their due Courſe, the Iſſues ought to be cloſed up, that Nature may accuſtome her ſelf to exclude ſuperfluous Humors by the Womb.</p>
                     <p>In the Uſe of the Remedies aforeſaid, ſome precepts are to be obſerved worthy of Note.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That we muſt never uſe Medicines that move the Courſes, but after Univerſal Purgations; leaſt the Humors being plentifully carried to the Veins of the Womb ſhould increaſe Obſtructions; or being much attenuated, ſhould reach into other parts of the Body, and produce grievous Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. As <hi>Schenkius</hi> relates in his Obſervations, that a Phyſitian of <hi>Venice</hi> gave a Woman that wanted her Courſes a certain Apozeme to move them, not having firſt purged her Body of Flegm; and a little after ſhe had taken her Apozeme, ſhe fell into a Palſey.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That in giving ſuch things as bring down the Courſes, we muſt begin with the gentler, proceeding by little and little to ſuch as are ſtronger.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That Medicaments procuring the Flux of the Courſes, muſt be given in greater quantity than ordinary, becauſe their vertue is abated in their long paſſage from the Stomach unto the Womb.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, That the Medicaments aforeſaid, are to be given either in the morning, when the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent is faſting, or ſomtimes at her going into, or coming out of the Bath: For ſo the Medicine ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping into a warm and opened Body, doth powerfully exerciſe it's ſtrength; and this it doth yet more effectually, if it be given a little before the inferior Veins be opened.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, That Peſſaries, and Womb-Clyſters, or Injections, are only to be preſcribed to married Women, and ſuch as have been carnally imbraced by Men; but to Virgins we muſt preſcribe <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcalia</hi> (viz. Wool dipped in the Medicament) Fomentations, Baths to ſit in, and Suffuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly, In Cholerick or Melanchollick Conſtitutions, all hot Medicaments are to be avoided, and only the gentler and milder ſort are to be uſed; and with them temperate Aperitines, or openers, as alſo moiſtning and ſoftning Medicaments are to be mixed.</p>

                        <hi>Chap. 3.</hi> Of the Immoderate Flux of the Courſes.</head>
                     <p>WOmens monthly Courſes, being moderate in quantity, and flowing in due ſeaſon, are Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural: But if they exceed in quantity, or come too often, or ſtay too long: They are to be accounted Immoderate, and beſides the intent of Nature.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes of this Immoderate coming down of the Courſes, are the ſame which (we in it's proper place have ſhewed) do concur to Cauſe ſpitting of Blood; <hi>viz.</hi> An opening of the ends of the Veins, a ſoaking of the blood through the Coates of the Veins, a forcible rending of the Veins, and heir be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eaten through by ſharp humors; all which are cauſed by the bloods over great abundance, Heat, Thinneſs, or Sharpneſs: By ſome blow, fall, or wound: Which we have at large declared in our Speculations touching ſpitting of blood, ſo that it is needleſs here to repeat the ſame. Let the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der be pleaſed to peruſe that Chapter.</p>
                     <p>The Signes of this Infirmity, are either of the Diſeaſe it ſelf, or of it's Cauſe. Immoderate Flux of the Courſes is known by the il-bearing of the Patient, decay of ſtrength, want of appetite to meat, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſtion of Humors, ill Habit of the whole Body, colour of face like a dead Corps, ſwelling of the Legs, and other more grievous maladies, cauſed by decay of Natural heat paſt away in the Blood.</p>
                     <p>To know the Cauſes, obſerve theſe ſignes following: A thin Habit of Body, and ſoftneſs of the Fleſh, with ſuch a diet as tends to increaſe the wheyiſh, and thinner parts of the Blood; and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Blood it ſelf appearing thin and watry, in the cloaths coming from the Patient, doth ſhew that the Blood hath ſoaked through the Veins.</p>
                     <p>That the Immoderate Flux is cauſed by an opening of the ends of the Veins, or a breaking of their Coates, is known by the Foregoing of Wounds, Falls, or Bruiſes; by the uſe of dancings, long out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries, carrying unuſual weights by a Perſon corpulent and full of Blood: By ſome foregoing great heat, extream Cold, Immoderate carnal imbraces, great Anger, and the like. The ſame may alſo happen after fore labor in Child-birth, or by the unskilful handling of a Midwife; after a miſcarriage, or after a long ſtoppage of the monthly Blood, which makes the ſame being collected in too a great quantity, breaks out on a ſudden with violence.</p>
                     <p>That there is an Exulceration in the Womb, whereby the Veins are eaten through, appears by the Bloods dropping out by little and little with a ſence of pain and ſharpneſs; and by the Bodies being repleniſhed with ſalt and ſharp Humors. Alſo the blood which comes away, is at firſt Matteriſh, Wheyiſh, Blackiſh, or Yellow; and afterward if the Exulceration increaſe, ſome bits of the parts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected are eaten off, whereupon follows a great effuſion of Blood, hard to be ſtopped. Alſo there have proceeded ſuch things as are wont to breed bad Blood, ſuch as are the uſe of ſharp things in Diet, the uſe of Salt meates, of meates putrefied, and ſuch like.</p>
                     <p>As for the Predictions belonging to this infirmity, we are to know that, all large and long-laſting Iſſues of Blood are dangerous; eſpecially thoſe from the Womb, which hurts not only her that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers them, but hinders poſterity.</p>
                     <p>That which comes by a ſoaking of the Blood through the Veins, is of al others the leaſt dangerous, as cauſing leſs expence of heat and Spirits, yet it continues longer, by reaſon of the continual ſupply of raw and Wheyiſh Blood.</p>
                     <p>The breaking of Veins, and the opening of their mouths, cauſe greater danger, becauſe they do ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly Iſſue forth great quantities of Blood; yet are they ſooner cured, as happening for the moſt part, only in Bodies over ful of Blood, and otherwiſe healthy.</p>
                     <p>But of all others, that which Springs from Exulceration is moſt hard to cure, becauſe where the Ulcer is, there ſome part of the ſubſtance of the Veins is periſhed, which hinders the growing together again of that breach, whence the Blood Iſſues.</p>
                     <p>If the ſick party grow daily weaker and weaker, and the Diſeaſe ſtronger and ſtronger, it portends her death.</p>
                     <p>In an elderly Woman, over great Flux of her Courſes, is commonly incurable, and deadly.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of Immoderate Flux of Courſes, muſt be in a manner the ſame, which we have preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to cure the immoderate running of the Hemorroids.</p>
                     <p>For in the firſt place, to draw the Blood from the part affected, the Patient muſt bleed in her Arm, not all at once, but by degrees, now and then ſtopping the Orifice with your ſinger, and then letting it bleed again. She muſt bleed plentifully, as much as her ſtrength can bear. For <hi>Hollerius</hi> in his Comment upon the 50. Aphor. of the 5. Sect. doth teſtifie that he hath ſeen many Women cured by large Blood-letting, when the Iſſue of their Blood, could by no other remedies be ſtopped.</p>
                     <p>Rubbings, Bindings, and Cupping-glaſſes, ate good to cauſe revulſion, as in the cure aforeſaid we
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:49088:201"/>
have ſhewed, eſpecially if the Cupping-Glaſſes be faſtened upon her Dugs, according to that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>Hippocrates;</hi> If you would ſtop a Womans Courſes, faſten a very large Cupping-Glaſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her Dugs: Howbeit, if upon the ſetting on of the Cupping-glaſs, ſhe grow ſhort breathed, you muſt quickly take it off again.</p>
                     <p>Likewiſe the ſame Purgation may ſerve which we propounded in the Cure of the Hemorrhoids; and it muſt be reiterated once or twice in a week, until the impurity of the Bowels, and the Veins be taken away. For when the Chollerick and Wheyiſh Humors are taken away, which make the blood thin and ſharp it leaves running of it ſelf. If the Wheyiſh parts ſeem moſt to abound, Mechoacan with Rhubarb will be a good Purge.</p>
                     <p>A Vomit likewiſe doth powerfully draw the Blood upwards, and is commended by <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> in his Second Book of Womens Infirmities. But the Vomit muſt be gentle, and often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated. Alſo it may ſuffice for the Patient to put her finger into her Throat, and ſo procure Vomit: Yea, and the Truth is, it may ſerve the turn, and will be very profitable for her to provoke her ſelf to Vomit before her Dinners, but ſo as not to vomit, only to uſe ſome forcing thereunto. Unto which Remedies, theſe which follow may profitably be added, as being tried by very learned Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>the Shels of two new laid Eggs burnt, Frankinſence, Maſtich, of each half an ounce: Pearls prepared, red Coral prepared, and Amber, of each two drains: Blood-ſtone and Smaragd prepared, of each half a ſcruple: Barley made without Bran, two pugils: four whites of Eggs, and if need be, add a little Water, in which red hot Steel hath been quenched, and make two Cakes, which muſt be baked ſo hard in an Oven, that they may be beaten to Pouder. Of which Pouder give from half a dram to a dram early in the morning, in a draught or meſs of Broth made of Sheeps Trotters.</hi>

                     <p>The Acid Mineral Springs, whether they have their Tincture from Vitriol, Iron, or Allum Mines, do much conduce to the ſtoppage of immoderate Courſes, both by removing the Cauſes, and by ſtrengthening the Bowels affected.</p>
                     <p>The Chymiſts do much commend the Tincture of Coral, and <hi>Vitriolum Martis</hi> [Vitriolated Steel] and many other Medicines, which you ſhall find in their Books.</p>
                     <p>Let the Patient uſe to drink the Decoction of Maſtich, Yarrow, or of the dried Lentiſch, or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtich tree. Alſo the Lentiſch or Maſtich Wood, may be ſteeped in black harſh Wine, which doth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much ſtrengthen the Bowels, and ſtop defluxions.</p>
                     <p>It muſt be diligently remembred, That in an old Flux, very aſtringent and thickening Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are not to be uſed long together. For it is to be feared, leſt they ſhould fill, ſtraighten, and ſhut up the ſecret paſſages of the Body, and ſo breed Obſtructions, and very much hurt the principal Bowels, which are wont to ſuffer very much in this Diſeaſe. But it is much better to perſiſt in the uſe of ſuch things as ſtrengthen the Liver, which have ſome aſtriction, but ſo moderate as can do no harm.</p>

                        <hi>Ludovicus Septalius</hi> in his Medicinal Animadverſions, in the 144.

It is a Medicine, eaſily gotten, and eaſily made, thus:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Seven pints of Water; boyl therein the rinds of three ſowr Orrenges not throughly ripe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cut into little thin bits or chips, and boyl them till two parts of the Water be conſumed. Give eight or nine ounces of the ſtrained Liquor to the Patient in the morning to drink. If you would have it more effectual, put an handful of Mouſ-ear into it, when it is almoſt boyled. And it will be yet more powerful, if you boyl it in</hi> Tunbridg <hi>water, or the like Medicinal Spring water: or if you boyl the aforeſaid Ingredients in eight pints of water, till two third parts be conſumed, and then ſtrain it, and quench red hot Steel divers times therein.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Externally this flux may be ſtopped by Medicaments applied to the outward parts of the Patients Body.</p>
                     <p>And in the firſt place, Fomentations may be thus made:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>the Roots of Biſtort</hi> [Adder-wort] <hi>Tormentil, and the peels of Pomegranates, of each one ounce: The Leaves of Plantane, Knot-graſs, Shepheards-purſe, and Horſ-tail, of each one

handful; Cypreſs Nuts, Balauſtians, Myrtle-berries, Sumach, of each one ounce: Boil them in Water that hath had Iron quenched in it, and in red harſh Wine mixed together. Strain out the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, and Bath therewith, the whole Share and Privy-parts, warmiſh, but not hot.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Alſo, Boil a piece of Sea-ſponge in ſtrong Vinegar, and lay it upon the Patients Share, and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and it wil powerfully ſtop the immoderate Flux of Courſes.</p>
                     <p>A Bath made of the aforeſaid Decoction, the Doſe Being augmented, will be good for the Patient to ſit in: But care muſt be taken that it be not hot, but only warmiſh; otherwiſe it wil by it's heat, the more open the Veins of the Womb. A Bath made of the Decoction of Allum is very effectual; but it cauſeth barrenneſs.</p>
                     <p>After Fomenting and Bathing, the Patient muſt be anointed upon her Loyns, her Share, and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities, and between the Water-gate, and the Dung-gate (which ſpace is called <hi>Perinoeum,</hi> and wants an Engliſh name) with an Oyntment made as followeth.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Oyl of Mirtles, of Maſtich, and of Quinces, of each one ounce: Bole-Armoniack, Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons-blood, and Carabe, of each one drachm: Vinegar one ſpoonful. Make all into an Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>

                     <p>Take <hi>Ship-pitch half anounce: Male Frankinſence one ounce: Maſtich half an ounce: Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine one ounce: Dragons-blood, Red Roſes, of each two drams. Make thereof a Cerate to be applied to the Reins of the Back.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Plaiſters are alſo profitably applied unto the Navil, and Loyns, made of the Maſs of Plaiſter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Ruptures, the Plaiſter againſt the Mother, and of Maſtich Plaiſter, either alone, or mingled together: Or of the Plaiſter of <hi>Vigo</hi> for Fractures, which is moſt excellent; and works it's effect without heating the Part.</p>
                     <p>The following Cataplaſmes, are much more effectual, and very prevalent in a large Flux of Blood, cauſing danger of Death.</p>
                     <p>They are made, either of Bole-armoniack, incorporated with iuyce of Plantane and a little Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and ſo applied.</p>

                     <p>A Cataplaſm, or Pultis made of Nettles, fried in a Pan, and laid upon the Share and Privities, works more kindly than the former; rather by a ſpecifical property, then by it's aſtringency.</p>

And ſometimes we are wont to add to the aforeſaid Juy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of the Mucilage, of Gum Tragacanth one ounce: Starch one drachm: Water of Roſe-ſtalks, and Seeds three ounces, which are mixed, and Injected into the Womb.

                     <p>A Fume made with Vinegar, poured upon a red hot Iron Plate, and received by the Patient ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting over a Cloſe-ſtool, is very profitable; or a Fume may be compounded after this manner.</p>

                     <p>Aſtringent Peſſarles, are likewiſe uſual in this Cure.

                     <p>Touching the adminiſtration of Topical Medicaments, it is to be obſerved, That aſtringent Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, eſpecially the ſtronger ſort of them, are not to be applied before ſufficient Revulſions have been made, eſpecially by Blood-letting: for it is to be feared leaſt they cauſe Tumors, or other worſe Diſeaſes in the Womb. Wherefore alwaies, as far as the Diſeaſe will allow time, the Cure muſt be begun with internal Medicines of a thickening and aſtringent Nature, before we make uſe of the Topical Medicines aforeſaid.</p>
                     <p>This Method of Cure aforeſaid may with Judgment be accommodated to the Flux of Courſes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing either from an opening of the mouths of the Veins, or from a dreining of the blood through their Coats, or from a breaking of the Coats of the Veins: But if it ariſe from an eating or exulceration of the Coats of the Veins, it ought to be cured after the ſame manner, as an Ulcer of the Womb is cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, of which hereafter.</p>
                     <p>In the whol Courſe of the Diſeaſe, while the foreſaid Medicaments are uſed, care muſt be had to ſtrengthen the Bowels, and to correct the vitious quality of the Blood, as we ſhewed in our Cure of the Hemorrhoids.</p>
                     <p>And to conclude, When the Flux is allaid, the ſame Rules of Prevention are to be uſed in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, which we preſcribed concerning the Hemorrhoids.</p>

                     <p>A Woman is ſaid to have the Whites, the Womans Flux, the Flux of the Womb, or the White Menſtruals; when Excrementitious Humors do flow from her Womb, either continually, or at leaſt without any certain order, or courſe of time obſerved in their flowing.</p>
                     <p>And the ſaid Excrementitious Humors are ſomtimes white and flegmatick, very like to Whey, or Barley Cream; ſomtime they are pale, or yellow, or green by the mixture of Choller; ſomtimes watery by the admixture of ſerous Humors: ſomtimes blackiſh, by the admixture of Melancholly; ſomtimes ſharp and Corroſive, ſo as to eat into, and exulcerate ſome parts of the Womb; ſomtimes they are of a ſtrong and beaſtly ſmel, and other whiles again, not at all offenſive in that kind.</p>
                     <p>This Diſeaſe is wont to ſeize upon grown Women for the moſt part, and ſuch as are of riper Age; yet are not Virgins alwaies free from the ſame: ſo that ſome have done ill in daring to affirm, That ſuch Maids as are troubled with this diſeaſe, have parted from their Virginity, taking their Ground from the ſtraightneſs of thoſe Paſſages Naturally: For if Virgins have the Veins of their Wombs ſo large, that their wonted Courſes can flow through them, why may not the Whites likewiſe drop out by the ſame paſſages, ſeeing they are many times more thin and fluxive than the Blood it ſelf, as being wheyiſh and chollerick. The ſame is confirmed by the produced Experience of moſt learned Phyſitians, and dayly Practice teacheth me as much, <hi>viz.</hi> That the moſt chaſt and perfect Virgins in the World have had this Infirmity, of whom there could be no ſuſpicion that they had been corrupted. And <hi>Fernelius</hi> doth witneſs, That he ſaw a Girl eight yeers old which had this Diſeaſe, and was afterward a long time grievouſly troubled therewith.</p>
                     <p>The Excrementitious Humors aforeſaid, are bred either in the whol Body, or in ſome principal Part of the Body, or in the Womb it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>If the Humors flow from the whol Body, they proceed either from bad Diet, or from a vicious habitual diſtemper of the whol Body, and they take their courſe unto the Womb as unto a Sink, or Common-ſhoar, whereinto the reſt of the parts of the Body disburden themſelves.</p>
                     <p>The particular parts, by whoſe conſent the Womb ſuffers in this Diſeaſe, are chiefly, the Brain, Stomach, Liver, Spleen, Meſentery, and the Bladder, which diſpatch their Excrements unto ſuch parts as are more weakly, and ſo more diſpoſed to receive them.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Excrementitious Humors are bred in the Womb, becauſe when it is unable to digeſt its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per nouriſhment, by means of the weakneſs of its Retentive or Concoctive Faculty, the greater part of its Aliment is turned into Excrements, being imperfectly digeſted, or corrupted rather. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly digeſted in cold diſtempers of the Womb; and it is corrupted in hot diſtempers thereof. And ſeeing the Womb by want of Digeſtion, is defrauded of its Nutriment, it preſently draws new Aliment, which being turned into Excrements, is by the Womb expelled as unprofitable; and new Aliment is continually drawn, whereby this flux of evil Humors from the Womb, becomes both plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and continual. The Womb is weakened and more diſpoſed to the Reception of theſe Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by Child-bearing, travelling in Child-birth, Abortion, and Contuſion, Inflamation, Impoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humes, or Ulcers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="414" facs="tcp:49088:203"/>The Signs of this Diſeaſe, are referred to the Infirmity it ſelf, to the part affected, or to the cauſe producing the Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>The Diſeaſe it ſelf is eaſily known by relation of the ſick party, and it is often times attended with divers Symptomes, <hi>viz.</hi> Paleneſs of Face, want of Appetite, ſickneſs of Stomach, ſhort breathing, weakneſs, ſwelling of the Eyes, fulneſs, penſiveneſs and ſadneſs, thick Urines, turbulent, and many other accidents, which differ according to the diverſity of the Humors offending, as we ſhall declare more diſtinctly by and by.</p>
                     <p>The part affected, and the place in which theſe Excrementitious Humors cauſing the flux are bred, may beknown by theſe following tokens.</p>
                     <p>If the matter of the Flux is bred in the whol Body, theſe ſigns do ſhew it; <hi>viz.</hi> Wearineſs and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs not proceeding from any work, of which the Patient is eaſed, having disburdened her ſelf by the flux plentifully; and then again, when new matter is collected, ſhe begins to be weary and heavy as before; her Veins are full; her Feet, Hands, and Thighs, are apt to be numbed. And theſe ſigns do eſpecially diſcover only a plenitude of Humors. But that corrupt Humors do abound in the whol Body, is known by an evil habit in the whol Body [that is, an ugly ſickly appearance in the looks, and whol outward ſtate of the Body] a puffing up of the Hands and Feet, an itching and ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in the whol Body, if the Humor be ſharp, and many ſuch ſigns as theſe.</p>
                     <p>If the matter offending reſide in ſome peculiar part; the Symptomes and Excrements proper to that part, diſcover the ſame; as for example: A pain, heat, and ſwelling of the Liver, with Cholle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick Excrements, do ſhew the Liver to be affected; and the ſame Symptomes happening on the left ſide, with Excrements of a Melanchollick appearance, do argue the flux to ſpring from the Spleen: Flegmatick Excrements, Stomach-ſickneſs, want of Appetite, and ſomtimes extream Appetite, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent corruption of the meat, and ſowr belchings, or fatty (as of the Dripping-pan, or over-ſcorched fleſh) are ſure tokens of the Stomachs faultineſs.</p>
                     <p>Pain of the Head, Froathy Excrements, ſome uſual evacuation by the mouth or noſtrils being ſtopped, do witneſs that flux ſprings from the Head. If none of the aforeſaid ſigns of ſome part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected appear, then we may conjecture that the flux proceeds primarily from the womb. Alſo the Woman (in ſuch a caſe) is well colored, the matter flowing is but little in quantity, being the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the womb alone. There have preceded ſuch cauſes as weaken the Womb, as are hard Travel, Abortion, a Fall upon the Belly or Back, immoderate Carnal Embraces, eſpecially if the woman have been too young married, Tumors, Ulcers, and other Infirmities of the Womb, whoſe ſigns are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in their proper Chapters.</p>
                     <p>The Humor cauſing the Flux is known chiefly by the colors of that which comes away, which were a little before declared, and which appear in the cloaths wherewith it is received, if, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> teacheth in his ſecond Book of Womens Infirmities, the ſaid cloaths being dried, ſhall be after waſhed in Water alone, and dried in the ſhadow: for ſo they manifeſtly declare the color of that Humor which moſt abounds in the Excrements. Hereunto may be added the ſigns of an Humor abounding in the whol Body, uſually delivered in that part of the Inſtitution of Phyſick, which treats of Signs.</p>
                     <p>In the laſt place, We are to propound ſuch Signs as diſtinguiſh this Diſeaſe from others like unto it; as namely, Excretion of Purulent matter proceeding from an Ulcer of the Womb, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norrhoea, or flux of Seed.</p>
                     <p>It is diſtinguiſhed from purulent Matter by the ſigns of an Ulcer in the Womb, which ſhall be ſet down in their proper Chapter; as likewiſe, becauſe the Purulent Matter or Quittor, is much thicker, whitiſh, and leſſer in quantity, if it be digeſted rightly; but if it be of a goary, ſanious, and fleſhy appearance, like blood and water mingled, there is then blood amongſt the matter, and it is wont ſomtimes to come away with ſtrings from the Womb, and with exceeding pain; alſo the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that have Ulcers in the Womb or its Neck, admit not of Copulation but with pain, which exaſperates their Diſeaſe; but thoſe which are troubled only with the Whites, do willingly and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently suff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>r themſelves to be embraced by their Husbands.</p>
                     <p>In the Gonorrhoea, the matter which comes away is not ſo much in quantity, is thicker, of a more ſhining whiteneſs, holds up longer from flowing, and ſeldom or never ſtinks. But if it be a virulent or venemous Gonorrhoea (ſuch as accompanies the Letchers Pocks) it is known by ſharpneſs of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, Ulcers of the Privy parts, and other Signs that argue Malignity.</p>
                     <p>The Predictions or Prognoſticks of this Diſeaſe, are as followeth:</p>
                     <p>This Diſeaſe in one reſpect may be called good, in another reſpect bad: Good, foraſmuch as commonly it is not attended with any danger of death; and bad, becauſe it is a ſtubborn Diſeaſe, long laſting, and moſt exceeding hard to be cured; foraſmuch as the flux of evil Humors having once taken this courſe, is very hardly turned out of its Channel, becauſe the Womb (as we ſaid before) is the Draught of the whol Body, whereby even in time of Health, the ſuperfluous Humors of the whol Body are monthly evacuated.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="415" facs="tcp:49088:203"/>If this Infirmity get head, it may bring many other Evils upon the Patient, as Barrenneſs, falling down of the Womb, Exulceration, Cachexia, Dropſie, and Conſumption.</p>
                     <p>A Flux of Whites, blewiſh, bloody, ſtinking, is worſe than the white, pale, not ſtinking.</p>
                     <p>The longer this Diſeaſe hath laſted, the harder it is to cure.</p>
                     <p>It attends old Women to the grave for the moſt part, becauſe of their abounding with flegm, and the weakneſs of their Concoctive Faculty.</p>

An Apozeme therefore may be appointed both altering and purging for four or five daies by way of a ſolemn pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, alwaies remembring that to the purging Medicaments, ſome aſtringent and corroborating things are to be added, leſt the Humors of the Body being ſtirred, ſhould fall more abundantly into the Womb.</p>
                     <p>Touching Blood-letting, it is a queſtion, whether it be convenient in this Diſeaſe or not: For ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Flux is cauſed by ill Humors in the Body, which by Blood-letting are drawn into the Veins and ſo may corrupt the Maſs of Blood; it ſeems there is in this caſe no place for bleeding. Alſo, ſince in this lingring Diſeaſe, the Patients ſtrength is much abated, and the Body often brought into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, it ſeems unſit to weaken it yet more by blood-letting, and ſo defrauding it of its nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Which Controverſie is thus decided; That if the flux be not pure and ſimple, but in ſome meaſure mingled with Blood, and it appear reddiſh, that then a Vein may be opened; as alſo if the Liver be very much heated, and the ſharpneſs of Choller be joyned with the flux. In other Caſes, eſpecially if the flux have endured long, it is better to abſtain from Blood-letting.</p>
                     <p>Bindings of the upper parts of the Body, and Cupping-glaſſes applied to the ſhoulder-blades, and to the back, wil be very uſeful to draw the Humors upward; alſo rubbings of thoſe parts wil be ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially profitable, firſt with finer and ſofter cloaths, than with rougher and courſer, which <hi>Galen</hi> dayly practiſed upon the Wife of <hi>Boetius,</hi> whom he cured in the ſpace of thirteen daies, as himſelf relates in his Book of Prognoſticks dedicated to <hi>Poſthumus,</hi> Chap. 8.</p>
                     <p>And beſides the Univerſal Purgation already propounded, ordinary Purgations are alſo to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, and frequently reiterated, that the ſuperfluity of Excrements may be the better evacuated by little and little, and that Nature may get a cuſtom to void thoſe Humors by ſtool, which former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had their recourſe unto the Womb. To this intent, Magiſterial Syrups, Pills, and uſual Opiates may be compounded, ſuitable to the temper of the Patient, and the Humors offending. In this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe cauſed by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>legm, <hi>Mercatus</hi> commends a Syrup of the Decoction of <hi>Lignum vitae,</hi> with Senna, Turbith, and Agarick; as alſo the following Pills:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of the Maſs of Pills of Hiera picra, one dram: Agarick trochiſcated one dram and an half: with Honey of Roſes make them into Pills, of which let the Patient take early in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſix or ſeven every third day: afterward, only three of them every fift or ſixt day.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or for the greater Aſtriction, as wel as purging, they may be thus compounded, in whatever Complexion.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Choyce Rhubarb oft-times sprinkled with the Juyce of Roſes, two drams: Citrine colored, white and black Myrobalans ſteeped in the Juyce of Roſes, of each one dram: Maſtich one ſcruple: Spicknard half a ſcruple: With Syrup of Roſes make all into a Maſs of Pills. Let the Doſe be one dram twice in a week.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For a Flux ariſing of Seroſity, or Wheyiſh Excrements, Jallap is moſt excellent, which may be thus uſed:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Jallap finely poudered one dram: Cinnamon finely poudered half a ſcruple. Mix them, and with a draught of Chicken Broth, give it the Patient in the morning.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A Laxative Ptiſan dayly taken for a month together, hath cured a ſtubborn Flux of Whites, when nothing elſe could, as is to be ſeen in our Book of Medicinal Obſervations.</p>
                     <p>Vomiting is likewiſe much commended in this Diſeaſe, eſpecially in ſuch as are eaſie to vomit, becauſe ſuch indigeſted humors as are wont to be gathered about the Stomach, are hereby both eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated, and powerfully revelled or drawn back from the Womb. Among convenient Vomits, Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarum of <hi>Fernelius</hi> his Invention is commended, half an ounce whereof, given in Water and Honey, or with one ounce of Oxymel, and warm Chicken Broth, twice or thrice in a month, moves three or four Vomits, without any trouble.</p>
                     <p>After ſufficient Purgations, ſweat may be procured to expel the remnants of the Excrementitious Humor; and alſo to cauſe a further Revulſion of the Humors falling into the Womb.</p>
                     <p>To this intent, a Decoction of <hi>Lignum vitae,</hi> and Saſſaphras, will be good in ſuch as are flegmatick; and of China and Sarſaparilla in ſuch as are Chollerick and Melanchollick, cooling and temperate Herbs being added, leſt the evil Humors be more exaſperated, and become more ſharp.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="416" facs="tcp:49088:204"/>Or Sweat may be provoked by a Decoction of hot Herbs, as Nep, Calaminth, Fennel, Hyſop, Elicampane, Chamomel, Dill, and ſuch like, the evaporation of which Herbs being artificially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived upon the Patients Body, will procure ſweat. A Bath may alſo be made of the ſame Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by which ſweat may be provoked. But in hotter Conſtitutions, a Bath of freſh fair Water blood-warm, will be ſufficient, in which moderate and gentle ſweats only may be procured.</p>
                     <p>Sulphurous Baths do alſo powerfully cauſe ſweat, and conſume the reliques of this Diſeaſe: and by help of ſuch Baths we have known ſome Women cured, that no other means could help.</p>
                     <p>As touching Piſs-driving Medicines, its a weighty queſtion whether or no they are fit to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred in this Diſeaſe? For they do not only provoke Urine, but the Courſes likewiſe, by heating and attenuating the Humors contained in the Veins. Yet are they allowed by all Authors, and by <hi>Galen</hi> himſelf, who uſed them in the Cure of the Wife of <hi>Boetius:</hi> And the reaſon is, Becauſe Piſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drivers do provoke Urine Primarily, and the Courſes Secondarily, and as it were by accident or chance. Again, the Kidneys do perpetually draw Wheyiſh Humors unto themſelves, whereas the Womb does only receive them; whereupon it is credible that the greateſt part of ſuch Humors, will have recourſe into the waies of Urine.</p>
                     <p>Now the Piſs-driver which <hi>Galen</hi> uſed in the foreſaid Woman, is a Decoction of Aſarum and Smallage in fair Water; howbeit, it will be better temper'd, if it be made in Succhory Water.</p>
                     <p>A more compounded Piſs-driving Broth, may be thus made:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>the Roots of Aſarum, and of Smallage, of each one ounce: Leaves of Calaminth, and Soldanella, of each one handful: Elder flowers half a handful: Polypody, and Carthamus ſeeds, of each half an ounce: boyl all to a pint. Give five ounces of the Liquor or Broth ſtrained, in the morning. If you would make it purgative, add a little Agarick, and a little Turbith boyled with the reſt, in a Rag.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It's queſtioned whether Iſſues in the Legs are good for this Diſeaſe; for by drawing the Humors downwards, they may decreaſe the Flux. Howbeit, experience hath ſhewed that they do good in old Fluxes, becauſe by ſuch paſſages, ſome part of the Excrementitious Humor is voided.</p>
                     <p>If Chollerick and ſharp Humors cauſe this Diſeaſe; not only purgers of Choller are to be given, but likewiſe Alteratives which cool and thicken, and are moderately Aſtringent; ſuch as theſe Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leps following.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the leaves of Succory with the roots, of Endive, Borrage, Lettice, and Purſlain, of each half an handful: of new Sebeſtens and Jujubes, of each ſeven in number: of the four greater cool Seeds, and white Poppy Seeds, of each half a drachm: of red Roſe-leaves a pugil. Boil al in Water ſufficient, unto a pint, and in the ſtrained liquor diſſolve Syrup of Quinces, or of dried Red Roſes three ounces, and make a Julep, for three Doſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if Melanchollick humors abound, they are to be altered and Purged away, by Medicines proper to that intent.</p>
                     <p>The uſe of Chalybeate milk taken forty daies together, the quantity of four or five ounces is very proper for either of the aforeſaid Humors; whereunto may be added towards the end, a little Bole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armoniack, or <hi>Terra Sigillata.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the whole Courſe of Curing, it is to be conſidered, whether any part of the Body be miſaffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſo may ſend the matter of the Flux into the Womb; and if ſo, then care muſt be taken for the uſe of that part.</p>
                     <p>For if Humors flowing from the Brain, do cauſe this Diſeaſe, Remedies are to be applied to that part; eſpecially ſuch as revel and divert the Fluxion, <hi>viz.</hi> Cupping-glaſſes frequently faſtned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſhoulders and Back, Medicines ſnuft up into the Noſtrils, Maſticatories, Veſicatories, and Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues made in the hinder part of the Head, or in the nape of the Neck; inſtead where of Setous may be uſed, which are more effectual. And <hi>Febritius Hildanus</hi> in the forty one Cure of his firſt Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, relates that he cured a Woman long troubled with the Whites, and thereby Barren, by a Seton.</p>
                     <p>If the Humors flow from the Stomach, Liver, or any other part, ſuitable Remedies muſt be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that part.</p>
                     <p>The Body being prepared, and the offending Humor for the moſt part evacuated, or derived ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way: We muſt proceed to corroborating and Aſtringent Medicaments. But they muſt never be uſed until the Antecedent matter be wel evacuated, and diverted. Otherwiſe, thoſe Humors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, do ruſh into the more noble parts, and ſtir up more grievous Symptoms. As <hi>Galen</hi> in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-cited place relates to have befallen the Wife of <hi>Boetius,</hi> Whoſe Belly, ſwelled, by meanes of the unſeaſonable uſe of Aſtringents, by which the Wheyiſh Humors were retained in her Body, which were wont to paſs away in the Flux. It is likewiſe to be remembred, that whilſt we are in the uſe of Aſtringent Remedies, we do then divert the Antecedent Matter, and hinder the ſame from increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, by the Remedies aforeſaid. Amongſt theſe principal corroborating Medicines, Treacle is rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned, which is to be uſed in flegmatick Conſtitutions. Conſerve of Roſes, and of Wormwood,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:49088:204"/>
may be mingled with the Treacle; Or the following Opiate may be compounded,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Conſerve of Roſemary flowers one ounce: Conſerve of Calamus Aromaticus two drachms: Species of Diarrhodon Abbatis, and of Aromaticum Roſatum, of each one drachm: Red Coral prepared half a drachm: Treacle two drachms; with Syrup of preſerved Citron peeles Make all into an Electuary.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>old Conſerve of Red Roſes, Roots of Comfry, Bugloſs, and Citron peeles, of each one ounce: Red Coral burnt, ſhavings of Ivory, Bole-armoniack, Terra Sigillata, Dragons-blood, of each one drachm; with Syrup of Red Roſes dried: make all into an Opiate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The pouder of Sage, Salſa-parilla, and Baula ſtians taken every morning in broath, is the Court-La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies Medicine.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Zecheus</hi> commends this following Electuary, which he had often uſed with happy Succeſs.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Gum Arabick, and Gum Tragacanth, of each two drachms: white and red Coral, burnt Eg-ſhels, Harts-horn, Dill ſeeds, Amber, of each four Scruples: Honey of Roſes, as much, as will make all into an Electuary. Of which give half an ounce two hours before meat. Let the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſwallow it down, and drink after it four ounces of Plantane Water, mingled with two drachms of red Wine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Juleps may be made of Roſe-water, Knotgraſs, and Plantane waters, with the Syrup of Myrtles, dried Roſes, and the like: Some of the aforeſaid pouders being added.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mercurialis</hi> ſaies he frequently uſed a Decoction of Oak-leaves, with the Runnet of an Hare; wherewith he cured many Women of this Diſeaſe. His manner of making his Medicine was thus.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Decoction of Oak-leaves five or ſix ounces: of the Runnet of an Hare, one dram:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Let her take this Medicine eight or then daies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When the Diſeaſe comes from Choller, the following Syrup may be prepared, which is ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Aſtringent, and cooling. Thus,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>red Roſe Water four pints: Spirit of Vitriol, ſo much as will make the Water a little ſharp; but ſo as ſcarce to be perceived by taſte: red Roſes dried three pugils: Steep them in the Water cold, two daies, S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ain it, and add thereto ſo much Sugar of Roſes, as will make a Syrup.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And Finally, Thoſe Aſtringent remedies muſtred up in the former Chapter, touching the Immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Flux of Courſes, may be likewiſe uſeful in this Cure.</p>
                     <p>The Patient may uſe inſtead of ordinary drink, a Diet drink of China-roots, or Maſtich wood, with Aſtringent Wine mingled.</p>
                     <p>The ſame time that the Patient takes in ſuch things as are Aſtringent, and do ſtrengthen the Womb, ſhe muſt likewiſe uſe outward Remedies applied to the place affected, <hi>viz.</hi> Fomentations, Baths to ſit, it, Oyntments, Plaiſters, Injections, Fumigations, and Peſſaries; ſuch as have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed againſt Immoderate Courſes.</p>
                     <p>But before theſe external Aſtringents are applied, the Womb muſt be well clenſed. Otherwiſe ſuch impurities would be therein retained, as returning back into the Body, may cauſe more grievous Diſeaſes. And in our clenſing, we muſt regard the Humor offending; for one ſort of Clenſers are fit for Flegmatick, another for Chollerick Humors.</p>
                     <p>If the Humor be Chollerick, let the Clenſing Injections be made of Barley-Water, Whey, Water ſweetened with Sugar. If it be Flegmatick, let them be made of Hydromel, or of the Decoction of Wormwood, Fever-few, and the like.</p>
                     <p>Alſo a Detergent Peſſary may be made of Treacle, and Turpentine; or of Mercury leaves bruiſed, and wrapped up in a fine Linnen rag very thin worn.</p>
                     <p>Let the Patient uſe theſe Clenſers, before the Aſtringents be applied, until her Womb be well pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified; which may be known, if little or no Humors come therefrom.</p>
                     <p>After the Uſe of the Clenſers, the Fumes are firſt to be received over a Cloſe-ſtool, becauſe they dry and ſtrengehen the Womb; and they may fitly be made of Frankinſence, Ladanum, Maſtich, Sanders, Nutmeg, and Red-Roſe leaves. And afterwards we muſt proceed to other Aſtringent Remedies.</p>

                     <p>WOmb-Furie is a ſort of Madneſs, ariſing from a vehement and unbridled deſire of Carnal Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracement, which deſire diſthrones the Rational Faculy ſo far, that the Patient utters wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and laſcivious Speeches, in all places, and companies, and having caſt off all Modeſty, madly ſeeks after Carnal Copulation, and invites men to have to do with her in that way.</p>
                     <p>This Immoderate deſire of Carnal Conjunction, ſprings from the abundance of Seed, from it's A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimony,
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:49088:205"/>
and heat tranſcending the bounds of Nature, whereby it is made to heave and work in the Seminal veſſels, as Yeſt works, whereby the parts made for generation, are vehemently ſtirred up, and Inflamed with luſtful deſires. And from the ſame Seminal matter ſo affected, Vapors aſcend unto the Brain, which diſturb the Rational Faculty, and depoſe it from its throne. Howbeit, The Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate appetite of carnal Conjunction alone, without the help of any ſuch vapors, is able of it ſelf to maſter the Rational faculty, as alſo al other Immoderate paſſions; but eſpecially Immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Love, which is called <hi>Eroticus affectus,</hi> or Love-Melancholly.</p>
                     <p>Now the Seed acquires the aforeſaid qualities, when it is over long retained in Bodies prone to luſt, and full of heat; and therefore this Diſeaſe is incident to Virgins, and young Widows peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly; although it may alſo betide married Women, that have impotent Husbands, or ſuch as they do not much affect, whereby their Seminary Veſſels are not ſufficiently diſburthened, or their amorous affections duly ſatisfied.</p>
                     <p>Some hold, That the Seed being corrupted, acquires a malignant quality, which cauſes theſe grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Symptoms. But they are not wel able, ſo holding, to ſhew any difference between this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, and fits of the Mother, which ariſe from the Seed being corrupted, and thereby infected with a malignant quality. For although ſeveral degrees of putrefaction do produce different degrees of malignity, from whence a great variety of Symptoms are wont to ariſe; yet theſe manifeſt qualities aforeſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> great plenty of Seed, it's heat, Acrimony, and Fermentation in exceſs, together with the great heat of the genital parts; are ſufficient to produce this Diſeaſe we treat of.</p>
                     <p>Now the Cauſes producing ſo hot, plentiful, and ſharp ſtinging Seed, are youthful age, Sanguine complexion, and Cholerick, or melancholly aduſt; meats that nouriſh much, a plentiful table, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if the meats be ſpiced; the frequent ſmel of Spices, Musk, Amber-greece, and ſuch like: large ſleeping, and upon ſoft beds filled with Feathers, or down; amorous Courtings, reading of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcivious Books, Dancings, and other pleaſures uſual in the meetings of youthful perſons.</p>
                     <p>The Signes of this Diſeaſe may eaſily be gathered out of what hath been already ſaid. But becauſe it is wont to diſcover it ſelf gradually, by little and little; it is ſit to relate it's progreſs. In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, whilſt the ſick perſons do yet enjoy their underſtanding, they are more ſad, and ſilent than ordinary, but with a wanton rowling of their Eyes, and a ruddyneſs of countenance; which ruddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is ſometime more then at others? eſpecially when mention is made of matters belonging to bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily luſt, for then their breathing is changed, and their Pulſe too, by Sympathy of the Heart, which made <hi>Galen</hi> boaſt that he knew the furious luſts of Women by their Pulſe; becauſe ſuch Lovers, do of a ſudden undergo divers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> changes of their Pulſe, when deſirable objects are preſented unto them, or brought into their remembrance. Afterwards when the Diſeaſe is exaſperated, they begin to ſcold, and to weep, and ever and anon they fall a laughing, they ſpeak many things without rime, or reaſon unadviſedly, out of which no certain ſence can be gathered; a while after, they repent of this their folly, until another fit take them, by reaſon of the inordinate motion of the peccant mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which obſerves no certain period in it's Fermentations. Women poſſeſſed with this kind of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, when the Diſeaſe is come to it's height, do openly before all the world ask men to lie with them expreſſing the actions of Generation in the moſt proper, and broadeſt language, their mother tongue affords.</p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſticks of this Diſeaſe. It is a curable ſickneſs, if meanes be uſed in time. But if it continue long, and take firm rooting, it turns into a true and perfect Madneſs.</p>
                     <p>There is a great hope of Recovery, when the diſtances between the fits begin to be longer than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, or when the Patients Body, being grown lean becometh fat again, and when mention of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters pertaining to Generation, doth no longer affect or diſturb them.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of this Diſeaſe tends to correct the hot diſtemper of the Bowels; eſpecially of the Womb, and the Blood, and Seed; likewiſe to evacuate the ſharp Humors, and Seminal matter of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending. All which may be done by the following Remedies.</p>
                     <p>And in the firſt place, Blood muſt be often drawn, as far as the Patients ſtrength can bear: that ſo the whol Maſs of Blood, and the Womb it ſelf may be cooled, and the fervent Blood may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from the Veins of the Womb.</p>
                     <p>And if the Patients monthly Courſes be ſtopt, the inferior Veins are afterwards to be opened, that they may by that means be brought down.</p>
                     <p>But if the Blood ſeems to have recourſe to the Hemorrhoid Veins, which is known by their ſwelling and redneſs; the ſaid Veins are to be opened by Application of Leeches</p>
                     <p>Afterwards a Purgation is to be given, made of the gentler ſort of Medicines purging Choller or Melancholly, according as the one or other Humor ſhal ſeem to abound.</p>
                     <p>This purgation is to be followed by Juleps that prepare the matter offending, <hi>Viz.</hi> ſuch as cool and gently open; which muſt be given three daies together.</p>
                     <p>Then a more ſtrong purgation is to be adminiſtred, which may wholy extirpate the foreſaid humors.</p>
                     <p>To which intent theſe Purging Medicaments may be uſed, which was ſet down in our Cure of Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which muſt be now and then repeated.</p>

                        <pb n="419" facs="tcp:49088:205"/>After iterated Purgations, the following Bath being frequently uſed in the whol courſe of the diſeaſe, will be very uſefull to cool the whol Bodie, and temper the fervor of the peccant Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Leaves of Lettice, Willow-tree, Water-lillies, Vine-tree, Purſlain, Penny-wort, of each a handful: Flowers of Violet, Water-lilly and Roſes, of each two handfulls. Boyle all for a Bath, into which Blood-warm let the Patient enter, twice in a day, without ſweating, far from meal-tide.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And forasmuch as a compleat, and entire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Bathing cannot conveniently be continued for ſo many daies together; at leaſt the Patient may Bath her lower parts frequently in a part of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid Decoction, yea or of meer Water, and the liquor muſt be only warmiſh: For the prime intention of this Cure is, that the Womb may be cooled to the purpoſe: which is confirmed by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Experiment propounded by Dr. <hi>Harvey,</hi> in his Treatiſe of the Child-bearing of a noble Lady, who had been more than ten yeers beſide her ſelf, by reaſon of this Womb-fury; whoſe Womb (after all things had been tried to reduce her to her wits, in vain) fell out, which they did not put up til the coldneſs of the external Air had healed its diſtemper; the event was, as the Doctor imagin'd, and ſhe grew quickly well, and her Womb was at laſt reſtored to its proper place.</p>
                     <p>For the greater cooling of the Body, it may be convenient to give the Patient Whey to drink many daies together.</p>
                     <p>And to be brief, Whatever hath been preſcribed in our Cures of Madneſs and Hypochondriacal Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly, will be good in this Diſeaſe, according as it ſhal be cauſed either by Choller or Melancholly.</p>
                     <p>Unto all which may be added ſuch things, which by a peculiar property, diminiſh and cool the Seed: Among which take theſe that follow for example.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Leaves of Water-lilly, Willow, Agnus Caſtus, of each four handfuls: Lettice, Purſlain, Penny-wort, or Two-penny Graſs, of each a handful: the four larger cooling Seeds, Lettice, and white Poppy ſeeds, of each half an ounce: Dill ſeeds two drams: the flowers of Water-lilly, and Violets, of each one handful. Let all be ſtamped, being freſh, and let them be ſprinkled with Juyce of Lemmons, and diſtilled in Balneo Mariae, and to every pint of the Water, add a dram of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire. Let the Patient take an ounce divers times.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or of all, or ſome of the Simples aforeſaid, a Decoction may be made, and ſweetened with Sugar, and a little Camphire put to it, to be taken divers times one after another.</p>
                     <p>Or an Emulſion may be made of the greater cool Seeds, Lettice ſeeds, and white Poppy ſeeds, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted with the Waters of Lettice, Willow and Water-lillies, and ſweetened with Syrup of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets.</p>
                     <p>An Electuary may be preſcribed after this manner:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Conſerve of the Flowers of Water-lillies, Violets, and Agnus Caſtus, of each half an ounce: Conſerve of Roſes half an ounce: Lettice Stalks preſerved one ounce: Coral and Smaragd prepared, of each one dram: with Syrup of Violets, and water-lillies, make an Opiate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the greateſt extremity of the Patients raving, ſuch things as procure ſleep, are very profitable, both inward and outward Medicaments, as they are ſet down in the Cure of Phrenzy and Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                     <p>In the whol courſe of the Diſeaſe, Clyſters which cool and gently purge, are to be uſed, taking heed of ſharp Clyſters, and ſuch as vehemently purge, which do exagitate the Humor contained in the Womb, or its Veſſels, whereby the Symptomes are wont to become more fiery.</p>
                     <p>Alſo Injections may be made into the Womb, of the Decoction of ſuch Herbs as have formerly been ſet down for Baths and other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Remedies, whereunto <hi>Sal Saturni</hi> may profitably be added.</p>
                     <p>Frequent Clyſters may likewiſe be good to the ſame intent, being made of Vinegar allaied with Water.</p>
                     <p>Alſo cooling Oyntments are to be applied to the Loyns, Privity, the Share, and between the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-gate, and the Dung-gate, made of Oyl of Water-lillies, Oyntment of Roſes, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum Camphoratum,</hi> with the Juyces of Nightſhade, Henbane, and Water-lillies, melted together, adding a little Camphire.</p>
                     <p>Alſo a Plate of Lead is good to be worn continually upon the Reins.</p>
                     <p>In regard of the immediate Cauſe, ſeeing the evacuation of the ſharp and corrupted Seed, may cure the Diſeaſe; it is very good Advice in the Beginning of the Diſeaſe, before the Patient begins manifeſtly to rave, or in the ſpace between her fits, when ſhe is pretty well, to marry her to a luſty yong man. For ſo the Womb being ſatisfied, and the offenſive Matter contained in its Veſſels being<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> emptied, the Patient may peradventure be cured.</p>
                     <p>But if the Patient cannot ſo conveniently be married, or the condition of her life will not bear that eſtate, ſome adviſe that the Genital Parts ſhould be by a cunning Midwiſe ſo handled and rubbed, as to cauſe an Evacuation of the over-abounding Sperm. But that being a thing not ſo allowable, it may fuffice whilſt the Patient is in the Bath, to rub gently her Belly on the Region of the Womb, not
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:49088:206"/>
coming neer the Privy parts, that the luke-warm temper of the Water may moderate the hotneſs of the Womb, and that it may by the moiſture be ſo relaxed, as of its own accord to expel the Seminal Excrement, and that nothing elſe be done with the hand, ſave a little to open the Womb, ſo as the Water may paſs into its more inward parts; foraſmuch as the water will operate as much as any of thoſe Medicines which are uſed to extinguiſh the ſeed withal.</p>
                     <p>Peſſaries may be compounded to the ſame intent of the Leaves of Mercury bruiſed, with a little Mirrh, or the Pouder of Ariſtolochia or Birthwort; which muſt be put up, when the Patient is in the Bath, leſt otherwiſe the VVomb ſhould be over-heated; and after an hour, it muſt be taken away. And afterward, let an Injection be made into the VVomb of VVhey, or Barley water, with a little Juyce of Nightſhade, Houſleek, or Hemlock, which is ſpecially commended in this Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>To purge out the Seed, the following Bolus or Morſel will be very profitable.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of Venice Turpentine three drams: Agaricktrochiſcated one dram: Carrot ſeed, Hemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed, and Lignum Aloes poudered, of each eight grains: With Sugar make all into a Bolus or Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to be ſwallowed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the Diſeaſe do yet continue, let Iſſues be made in her Thighs; for nothing is better than by ſuch meanes to draw the matter downward, from the Womb, to thoſe inferior parts.</p>
                     <p>And if ſwellings of the Spleen ſhall ariſe, and Obſtructions, during this Cure, as it often times hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens; they muſt be carefully cured with their proper Medicaments.</p>
                     <p>Finally, Becauſe in this Diſeaſe the Brain and Heart, are grievouſly affected, by reaſon of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porsariſing from the Womb, they are both of them diligently to be provided for; the Brain being ſecured by rubbing and chafing the lower parts, and by Cupping-glaſſes frequently faſtened upon the Hipps, and Groins; and the heart defended by Cordial things out wardly applied, both Liquid and Solid, ſuch as are deſcribed in our Chapter, touching decay of ſtrength.</p>

                        </gap>he Suffocation of the Womb, under the Title of Hyſterical Paſſion, calling a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Symptome by ſuch a name as is common to many others, becauſe it, of al the reſt, is moſt frequent, and moſt troubleſom. But herein the very beſt Authors ſeem to have been ſuperfluous in their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes of Womens Diſeaſes, while in different Chapters they deſcribe ſeveral Diſeaſes ſpringing from the Womb, viz. Suffocation of the Womb, Head-ach, Epileptical fits, Palpitations of the Heart, Pulſation of the Arteries about the ſhort Ribs, and in the Back, the Diſeaſes of the Stomach, Liver, and Spleen ariſing from the Womb, and divers pains in ſundry parts of the Body ariſing therefrom; ſeeing all theſe Infirmities do ariſe from one and the ſame cauſe, and are to be cured by the ſelf ſame Medicines; ſo that the aforeſaid Authors, are fain to repeat the ſame things over and over, in ſeveral Chapters, not without much wearineſs to the Reader.</p>
                     <p>We therefore, That we may more briefly, and methodically ſet down the Nature of all theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, think it worth our labor, firſt to ſet down the univerſal Cauſes of them all; and afterwards to declare how thoſe Diſeaſes ariſe from the ſaid Cauſes.</p>
                     <p>We have ſhewed in the beginning of this Chapter, that there are two ſpecial Cauſes of all theſe Symptoms, <hi>viz.</hi> the Womans Seed, and the Menſtrual Blood, being retained beſide the intent of Nature, and corrupted, and poſſeſſed of a malignant, and venemous quality; out of which malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Vapors, do ariſe, and afflict divers parts of the Body. Unto which Doctrine generally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, two other things of greateſt moment muſt be added, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, That not only the Seed and menſtrual Blood, do produce Hyſterical, or Womb-ſickneſſes; but divers Humors alſo of an excrementitious Nature flowing into the VVomb, and by a long abiding, growing putrefied, and ſending out filthy Vapors. This is verfied by many Ancient VVomen, who being deſtitute of menſtrual Blood and of Seed, are yet very much ſubject to theſe VVomb-ſickneſſes or Hyſterical paſſions. Secondly, that not only vapors ariſing out of the aforeſaid ſubſtances, are cauſes of theſe diſtempers, but the very Humors themſelves are a cauſe, which finding no free vent by
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:49088:206"/>
the Veins of the Womb (into which as a Common-ſhore Nature diſburthens ſuperfluous Humors) by reaſon of the ſtoppage of the Monthly Courſes or of the Whites; they flow back again into the ſuperior parts of the Body, and doe infect the ſaid parts with that vitious quality, which they have contracted by their long abiding in the Veſſels of the Womb, or by their mixture with Seed, or Menſtrual Blood corrupted.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Foundations being thus laid down, let us ſee how Hyſterical Symptomes are ſtirred up by the Cauſes aforeſaid, beginning with the Suffocation, or ſtrangling fits of the Mother, which is the moſt frequent and principal Sickneſs of theſe kind of Women, being accompanied with very many, and thoſe moſt grievous Symptomes. For beſides their breathing impaired, and ſomtimes aboliſhed, their whol Body becomes cold, their Speech and Pulſe is intercepted, ſo that they lie like dead Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and ſome have been accounted dead, and laid out for Burial, and yet afterward Revived.</p>
                     <p>Now this Sickneſs comes by fits, which makes their returns ſomtimes ſooner, ſomtimes later; and endure ſomtimes a longer, ſomtimes a ſhorter time, according to the quantity of the Humor of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending, which is ſomtimes quickly collected, and ſomtimes long in gathering; ſomtimes ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed, and ſomtimes long before it can be diſcuſt: For ſuch like Cauſes of Diſeaſes in the Body of Man, have their times of digeſtion and exaltation; which having arrived unto, they do ſuddenly, and as it were in a moment, break forth into action. Yea, and ſuch Humors being already collected in the Body, may for a ſeaſon lie hid, until being ſtirred by ſome internal or external Cauſe, they ſhed forth their poyſonous blaſts and vapors into other parts of the Body. Now the moſt frequent and noted Cauſed of this Commotion and Agitation of theſe Humors, are ſweet ſmelling things coming neer the Patients Noſe, or ſweet Meats taken in, which quickly bring Women ſubject to this Inſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, into their fits; alſo vehement Anger, Terror, and other grievous Paſſions of the Mind.</p>
                     <p>Now there are divers Degrees of this Sickneſs, according as the Matter offending differs in Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or Malignity. For ſomtimes the Choaking-fits, with want of breathing, are light and ſoon go over; ſomtimes it is extream, ſo that the Patient breaths not at all, and is attended with other Hyſterical or Womb-ſickneſſes, ſuch as Vomitings, Ravings, Convulſions, and Swoonings, or Faintings away.</p>
                     <p>And for the moſt part, more grievous Symptomes do ariſe from corrupted Seed, than from Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrual Blood, or other corrupted Humors. For look how much Seed retaining its Natural Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is of a more excellent Nature than Menſtrual Blood, by ſo much does it degenerate when corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, into a greater or worſer kind of Venom or Poyſon.</p>
                     <p>There are likewiſe other Differences of this Choaking Mother-ſickneſs, to be obſerved, viz. That ſomtimes the Patients have their Breath ſtopt as it were, ſomtimes they complain that they are choa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, as it were with a Rope that ſtrangled them; and ſomtimes their breathing is much abated, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed, without any pain or ſence of ſtrangling. The Reaſon of which diverſity is this; That the ſimple Suffocation, and difficulty of breathing, do ariſe from abundance of Vapors, which do ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times very much abound in Hyſterical or Womb-ſick Women, eſpecially when the Hyſterical Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Hypochondriacal Melancholly are joyned together. Which Vapors or Winds, do compreſs the Midrif and Lungs, as it is wont to fall out in the windy Aſthma; but the ſence of choaking, in which the Patient feels her ſelf as it were ſtrangled in her Throat, depends upon a ſpecial property of the venemous Vapor; as there are other Poyſons in the greater World, which have ſuch a proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of throatleing and choaking, as is known of one ſort of Muſhroms. And, that the venemous qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities bred in Hyſterical Women are divers, <hi>Galen</hi> does ſufficiently hint in his ſixt Book of the parts affected, Chap. 5. where he compares the malignity of this Vapor, to the venom of the Fiſh <hi>Torpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> and to the ſting of a <hi>Sco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>pion;</hi> which Poyſons, though in quantity they are ſmal, in operation they are mighty, and being received into mans Body, they do in a ſhort ſpace of time, grievouſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict the ſame, and produce therein moſt vehement Symptomes. As for Reſpiration diminiſhed or aboliſhed, it is cauſed by the ſaid Vapors being endued with a Narcotick or Stupefactive power, which being mighty contrary unto the Heart and Vital Spirits, their action is thereby hindered, whence follows a cooling of the whol Body through defect of that Spirit which ſhould flow from the Heart, and a ceſſation of Reſpiration, becauſe there is now no need thereof. For ſeeing that draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Breath is neceſſary to cool our Hearts, when the Heart is extreamly cooled by the venemous Vapors aforeſaid, it needs none of that cooling which is cauſed by drawing in the Air, and ſo brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ceaſes, becauſe there is no uſe thereof. We may alſo ſay, That the ſaid venemous and ſtupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying vapor, does aſſault the Brain, and hinder the Influx of the Animal Spirits, whereby the motion of the Midrif, and the Muſcles ſerving for reſpiration, is hindered; ad hereunto, That the Vital Spirits being deſtroyed, the Animal Spirits, which are made of the Vital, muſt needs be deſtroyed like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
                     <p>In the place before alleaged, <hi>Galen</hi> reſolves a Doubt, which is this: That ſeeing it is generally held that a man cannot live without breathing, therefore it is impoſſible that Hyſterical perſons ſhould in their fits be quite deprived of breathing. To which he anſwers, That in an extream cooling of the
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:49088:207"/>
Heart there is no need of reſpiration, which if it were ſtopped, and the Heart vigorous and hot, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent death would follow; but that little warmth which is yet remaining in the Heart, is cheriſhed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by tranſpiration, or ventilation through the Pores of the Body; even as Creatures lying all the Winter in holes do live only by tranſpiration, becauſe they are exceeding cold, and that little heat they have, needs no ventilation by way of drawing in Air into their mouths.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, The fore mentioned cauſe of Womb-ſuffocation, viz. A malignant and venemous vapor, ſome ad another, namely, The aſcending or riſing of the Womb into the ſuperior parts of the Body, whereby the Stomach and Midrif are compreſſed; from whence, not only Hyſterical Suffocations, but other ſickneſſes alſo do ariſe. This aſcending of the Womb, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> propounded in his Book of the Nature of Women, in theſe words: <hi>The Wombs of Women being turned from their Natural poſture, do ſtrive towards the Liver, and bear violently upon the Midrif; for they are carried upwards, ſeeking moiſture to refreſh them, being over dried with Labor; and the Liver is the fountain of pleaſing moiſture.</hi> And <hi>Fernelius</hi> in his ſixt Book of <hi>Pathology,</hi> that is, of Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and their cauſes, Chap. 16. ſaies, he had often felt the Womb thus aſcending, bearing up againſt the Stomach like a round Globe, and grievouſly oppreſſing the ſame, from whence it hath been often thruſt down by force of hand, and manifeſtly driven back into its own proper place. <hi>Euſtachius Rudius</hi> in the Second Book of his Practice, in the 51. Chapter, ſaies the ſame thing, viz. That he with his own hands hath ſelt the Womb raiſed as high as the Navel, and ſomtimes above the ſame, and hath by little and little thruſt the ſame down into its proper place. But <hi>Galen</hi> in his ſixt Book of Parts affected, Chap. 5. oppoſes this Opinion, and teaches that although the Womb may in ſome ſort be moved, and aſcend, yet that motion and aſcention is very little, neither is it any waies poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, That the Womb ſhould aſcend unto the Stomach, ſo far is it from being able to tranſcend the ſame ſo far as to reach unto the Midrif. A very ſtrong Reaſon hereof is brought from Anatomy, ſeeing the VVomb is ſo faſtened in its proper place by four very ſtrong Ligaments, that cannot be lifted up ſo high. VVhereunto the Defenders of this Opinion do make anſwer, That in the falling out of the VVomb, thoſe Ligaments are ſo relaxed that it is wont to come without the VVarer-gate, and therefore it may aſcend as far up as it can go down, when thoſe Ligaments are relaxed or ſlacke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. To this we reply, That the falling out of the VVomb comes to paſs by little and little through length of time, by the moiſtening and ſoftening of the Ligaments, cauſed by a defluxion of Flegm thereupon; but that which they call the Aſcent or Riſing of the VVomb or Mother, happens in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and is as ſoon reſtored; and it is requiſite that the Ligaments ſhould have been firſt relaxed, and conſequently all VVomen ſhould be troubled with the falling out of their VVombs, who are ſubject to this Aſcent or riſing we ſpeak of, becauſe the occaſions of this Aſcent being ceaſed, the VVomb would of its own accord, and by its own proper weight fall down wards, and lie continually without the Body.</p>
                     <p>It is harder to make Anſwer to the Experience of <hi>Fernelius, Rudius,</hi> and others; of which they teſtifie themſelves eye witneſſes, who profeſs they have with their own proper hands per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Womb to aſcend like a Globe or Bowl to the Navel and higher, being after wards by them thruſt down into its own proper, place. <hi>Sennertus</hi> makes anſwer to this, that the round body which was by them ſo felt, was not the Womb, but the Stones, with that blind Veſſel, which from <hi>Fallopius</hi> the finder or firſt Obſerver thereof is called <hi>Fallopious</hi> his Trumpet, becavſe he likened the ſame to the broad end of a Trumpet. For the Stones appertaining to the Womb being pendulous (that is, Hang dangling movable as on ſtrings) and the Body of the Trumpet afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid being hollow as a pipe, lax and apt to move this way, and that way; when they are filled with corrupt Seed, with vitious Humoes, and with windy Vapors, and ſwell and ſtrout again, they may move this way and that way in the lower Region of the Belly, and aſcend as high as the Navel. And that ſuch a round ſwelling may happen in the Stones and Trumpet, as is ſomtimes felt in hyſtericall Women. The obſervations of <hi>Riolanus</hi> may teach (propounded in his Book called <hi>Anthropographia,</hi> where he relates) that in hyſterical Virgins ſuch as have had the Womb-ſickneſs, He had found their Stones greater than his Fiſt, ſtrouting with wheyiſh ſeed; alſo the Trumpet of the womb amplefied or inlarged and very much widened. And <hi>ſalius</hi> obſerved ſome ſuch thing in a certain noble yong Damſel troubled with ſuffocations or ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the womb, in whom one ſtone was ſwelled to the greatneſs of a large hand-bal, being filled with a ſaffron-color'd humor, very ſtinking, and ſending forth a filthy and poyſonſom kind of vapor: Which humor dyed the adjacent parts yellow, juſt as we ſee the Gut Colon where it is carried under the Liver, is by the Bladder of Gall rendered of a clay-like yellowiſh Colour</p>
                     <p>Yet is not <hi>Sennertus</hi> very far from the judgment of the Authors aforeſaid; for granting, as he ſaies, that the Stones and Trumpet of the Womb, being filled with corrupt ſperm, vitious Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, and vaporous winds, do ſtrout again, move to and fro in the lower Region of the Belly, and can aſcend as high as the Navel; ſeeing thoſe parts are contiguous with the Womb, they cannot be moved in the Region of the lower Belly, nor aſcend unto the Navel, unleſs the Womb be moved with
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:49088:207"/>
them: ſo that this motion may be aſcribed to the whol Womb very well, as it conſiſts of its owne perfect parts together with ſuch parts as are knit there unto. Againe if the Stones and Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet being filled with vitious Seed, Humors or vapours, may be diverſly moued to and fro: Why may not the Womb being filled with like Humors and vapors, be moved with the ſame motion. Thereaſon indeed of <hi>Sennertus,</hi> which he borrowed from <hi>Galen</hi> does convince, that the VVomb tied with four ligaments, cannot aſcend ſo high as the Midrif, no not as high as the Stomach; but it muſt not be denied, that it may be carried as high as the Navel, where the Authors aforeſaid per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that Globe, both becavſe thoſe Ligaments may be ſomwhat ſtretched by matter working in them like yeſt, and like-wiſe becavſe the womb whiles it is blowne up, ſils a greater ſpace, and may be perceived towards the Navel; ſo that whether the whole womb, or the parts faſtened there unto. <hi>viz.</hi> The Stones and the Trumpet be moved upwards, we may ſtill call it the Riſing of the VVomb or Mother and cleave to the Doctrin of <hi>Hippocrates.</hi>

                     <p>Head-ach from the womb, comes divers waies; for ſomtime it poſſeſſes the whol Head, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles the forepart, and then again the hinder part thereof, and ſometimes it is felt about the Eyes, in ſuch manner as if the Patients Eyes would leap out of her Head.</p>
                     <p>Now theſe pains are cauſed by the aforeſaid ſharp and malignant Vapors mounting into the Head, and twitching as it were, or grating upon theſe Membranous parts: Alſo evil humors brought from the womb to the Head, may cauſe the ſaid pains. For vitious Blood; eſpecially the more thin and wheyiſh part thereof, aſcends from the womb into the Head, and being ſhed into the Membranous parts, bre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ds thoſe pains. VVhich pains are ſomtimes, pricking, ſmarting, and ſore as an Ulcer, by reaſon of the ſharpneſs of the Vapors, or Humors aſcending: Sometimes they are ſtretching, as it were, and ſwelling, becauſe of the plenty and multiplicity which diſcend and ſtretch: Somtimes they are pulſatory pain, beating like the Pulſe; when the Vapors or Humors are carried thither in the Arteries, or when the Arteries of ſome peculiar part of the Head are filled with over hot Blood.</p>
                     <p>The Falling-ſickneſs ſprings from the womb, being cauſed by the aforeſaid ſharp and malignant Vapors, which being poſſeſſed with a very great Acrimony and malignity, do vehemently, and ſharply ſmite the Nervous parts, whereby they come to be contracted, and whilſt they endeavor to expel what offends them, they draw themſelves together, and expreſs theſe convulſive mocions.</p>
                     <p>Palpitation of the Heart, is often cauſed by the ſaid Vapors, being carried from the womb to the Heart. and provoking the expulſive faculty to the Heart.</p>
                     <p>Alſo a Pulſation is cauſed in the Arteries of the Back, and about the ſhort Ribs, by reaſon of an over hot Blood, carried from the womb into thoſe Arteries, and diſtending them, whereby their Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation becomes greater, which ſmiting the adjacent parts, cauſes a feeling of the ſaid Pulſation in them: Yet, ſomtimes ſuch Pulſations are cauſed in Hypochondriacal melancholly, which when we come to the Signs of this Diſeaſe, we ſhal diſtinguiſh.</p>
                     <p>Divers diſorders are likewiſe raiſed from the womb in the ſtomach, liver, and ſplee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>; from the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach diſorders ariſe, as appetite loſt, or more than is fit, or deſirous of abſurd things; or Hiccoughs, Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitings, Belchings, &amp; Heart-burnings: al which Symptoms do ſpring from the aforeſaid vapors ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſtomach by the Hypogaſtrick, and Caeliack arteries, or other blind paſſages; &amp; thoſe vapors do ſtir up this variety of Symptoms, according to the diverſity of their Nature, and the different degrees of their putrefaction, and malignity. For by their heat they cauſe want of appetite, and thirſt; but if they be cold they hurt digeſtion. And the coveting of abſurd things (as Chalk, Oat-meal, Smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coles, Linſey-Wol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And from a certain kind of malignity ſprings likewiſe, the loathing of ſome certain meats; and which is more wonderful, in ſome hath been obſerved an univerſal loathing of al kind of Drink; as <hi>Ludovicus Mercatus</hi> relates concerning a noble Gentlewoman, which would not away with any Drink, and of another, who though ſhe deſired Drink, yet did ſhe Vomit it al up again, being likewiſe vexed with other grievous Symptoms. Where we may conjecture, that the evil Humors in that Gentlewoman, had attained ſuch a kind of malignity, as that is which cauſes Water-Fear in ſuch as have been bitten with a Mad-dog. It is, notwithſtanding, undeniable, that the diverſity of parts into which theſe Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, and malignant Vapors are carried, conduce not a little to the variety of the Symptoms. For, If they are carried unto the mouth of the Stomach, they ſtir up Belchings, and Vomitings; if they ſtick to the Coates of the Stomach, they induce perpetual inclinations to Vomit; if they are endued with any ſingular Acrimony, they cauſe Hiccoughs, or pains of the Stomach; which pains may alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from the plenty of Humors, weighing heavy upon, and ſtretching the parts containing.</p>

<pb n="424" facs="tcp:49088:208"/>
and from the Liver ſhed abroad into the whol Body. Hence come Swellings, Feavers, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diſeaſes very many, in the whol Body, and ſeveral parts thereof, foraſmuch as all of them are nouriſhed by the Liver.</p>
                     <p>But if the vitious Blood aforeſaid do flow back from the Womb unto the Spleen, Swellings, Stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings, and melanchollick, and Hypochondriacal Diſeaſes are wont to be raiſed.</p>
                     <p>And, To conclude, Women feel divers kinds of pains in their Loyns, Thighs, and other parts, which ariſe from filthy Humors, and Vapors conveighed from the Womb into the ſaid parts: Al which Symptoms, taking riſe from the Womb, ſhal be diſtinguiſhed from others which ariſe from other parts, and are like them, but produced from different cauſes; in our following Deſcription of the Signes of this Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place therefore, Womb-ſickneſs is known for the moſt part by what hath already been ſaid of it. For the fore recited Symptoms do appear therein, not al in every one, but ſome in one Patient, ſome in another, according to the differing condition of the Cauſes. Now theſe Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms are, Breathing, depraved ſo, as, ſometimes the Patient ſeems to be choaked; other whiles her brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is leſſened<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or wholly taken away, without any trouble or Sence of Suffocation; Refrigerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or cooling of the whol Body, and ſtopping or Interception of the Pulſe; ſomtimes alſo a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of Sence and motion; ſomtimes Ravings, Convulſions, Swoonings, Vomitings, and Hic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coughs are joyned together.</p>
                     <p>But for a more clear Diſcovery of this Diſeaſe, thoſe Signs are firſt to be propounded, which ſhew the Diſeaſe approaching, ſuch as have a noyſe in their lower Belly (firſt from the Navel downwards) with belching or inclination to Vomit; Wearineſſes, Yawnings, and ſtretchings, proceeding from a flatulent matter, which begins to mount from the Womb into divers parts of the Body; a ſad Look pale Face<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cauſed by the drawing back of the Natural heat, from thoſe Parts, to it's Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</p>
                     <p>When the Diſeaſe gathers ſtrength, a ſence of ſtrangling begins to trouble the Patient, as if they had ſwallowed ſome great morſel which ſtuck in their Throat. Afterward their breathing ſtops, and their Suffocation is increaſed. And in concluſion al<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their Vital, and Animal actions, are depraved, diminiſhed, or aboliſhed. Hence ſpring Ravings, Convulſions, and other grievous Symptoms. In ſome the Womb is ſenſibly toſſed and tumbled, and gathered round like a Foot-bal; and felt after that manner in divers parts of the lower part of the Body. And when the Hyſterical, or Womb-Fit begins to go over, a certain moiſture flows out of the Water-gate, their Guts rumble, they lift up their Eyes, redneſs ſprings up in their Cheeks, Sence and motion is reſtored, their Body grows warm, they fetch deep Sighs, and ſo the Sick-Party by little and little, is freed from her Fit.</p>
                     <p>By the Signs propounded, Womb-ſickneſs may eaſily be diſtinguiſhed from ſuch infirmities as are of kin, or otherwiſe like the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> the Syncope (Swooning-ſickneſs) Apoplexie (blaſting Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>-ſtriking)) and the Falling-ſickneſs: howbeit the difference between Womb-ſickneſs, and thoſe diſeaſes aforeſaid is peculiarly to be noted.</p>
                     <p>And in the firſt place, by three general Signs we may conjecture that theſe Symptoms which are common to Womb-ſickneſs, and the aforeſaid maladies, do proceed rather from the Womb, than from any primary miſaffection of the Heart or Brain. The firſt whereof is, that if the ſick Patient be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Womb-ſickneſs, and hath been often anoyed with aforeſaid Symptoms; when they come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh, we may conclude the Diſeaſe to be no other than Womb-ſickneſs. The ſecond is, That when Women begin to feel thoſe Symptoms, they complain that their Womb is out of order. A third is, That in Womb-ſickneſs Women do feel great eaſe when ſtinking things are put to their Noſes, and ſweet ſmelling things are put in by the Water-gate, which in thoſe other infirmities falls not out.</p>
                     <p>And the Hyſterical, or womb-ſickneſs is more peculiarly diſtinguiſhed from that which we cal Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cope, or the Swooning-Fits, becauſe in the Syncope, the breathing and Pulſe do wholly ceaſe; but in the VVomb-ſickneſs, it remaines in a ſmall meaſure, til they come into the very height of the Fit, wherein is moſt danger. Secondly, The Swooning Fits come more quickly, and ſeaze upon the Patient, as it were on a ſudden. But in the VVomb-Fit, there proceed evident tokens of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Fit. Thirdly, The Patients Face is paler in the Swooning-fits, than in the Womb-fits; yea verily, ſome Women have a ruddy countenance in their Fits of the Mother, and than the Diſeaſe is ſufficiently known by that Sign alone. Fourthly, In the Swooning Fits, we find commonly cold, and Diaphoretick Sweats, which in the Womb-fits appear not. Fiftly, The Swooning Fits a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e ſhorter, and the Patient is ſoon either wel or dead; but the ſtrangling Fits of the Mother laſt lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, continuing a whol day, or divers daies together ſometimes. But it is to be remembred, that the Swooning-ſickneſs, and the Womb-fits are ſomtimes joyned together, when the Heart is more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly afflicted than ordinary, or when the Patients ſtrength hath been much weakned by protra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Diſeaſe; and then the Symptoms of both Diſeaſes may be mixed one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>The Womb-Fit is diſtinguiſhed from the Apoplexie; Firſt becauſe that in the Wombs-Choa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king-Fits,
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:49088:208"/>
the Joynts are not ſo looſened, neither is the Sence of feeling wholly gone, as in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexie; but if they be pricked, or have their hairs puld off, they give a ſufficient Sign with their Hands that they feel the pain. Secondly, In perſons Apoplectical, Planet-ſtruck (as the ſimpler ſort do phraſe it) there is a perpetual ſnorting of the Patient, but in the Womb-ſtranglings, not. Thirdly, Womb-ſtrangled Patients when their Fit is over, remember what was done and ſaid, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their extremity; but in the Apoplexie it is not ſo.</p>
                     <p>It is diſtinguiſhed from the Falling-ſickneſs; Firſt, Becauſe convulſive motions are not alwaies <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>yned with Hyſterical Suffocations; and thoſe that do accompany the womb-Fits, are not ſo Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal as in the Falling ſickneſs, but moleſt only one or two members. Secondly. The Pulſe is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Fits of the Falling-ſickneſs, than it uſes to be when the Patient is wel; but in the Mother-Fits it is quite contrary. Thirdly, In the Falling-ſickneſs, the Patient fomes at the mouth, but in the Mother-Fits there is no ſuch foming. Fourthly, In the Falling-ſickneſs, the Patient remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers not what was done to her during the Fit, but in the Mother-ſickneſs ſhe remembers al, as we ſhewed before. Fiftly, Thoſe that have Fits of the Mother, do in the end of the Fit come to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves like perſons awaked from ſleep, with a noyſe in the lower part of the Belly, the Womb as it were becoming quiet, and returning to it's Natural place, and ſometime much humor flows from the Womb, which doth not befal ſuch as have the Falling-ſickneſs.</p>
                     <p>We muſt alſo enquire how ſuch as are in the Fits of the Mother, may be diſtinguiſhed from thoſe that are quite dead; ſeeing many Hiſtories relate that ſome Women in that Caſe have been accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted dead, appointed to buryal; yea, and ſome buryed. The waies which Authors preſcribe to make this tryal, are divers: For either they lay teazed wool, or light Feathers upon the Patients mouth, and if they ſtir not ſhe is given over for dead; or they apply a bright looking Glaſs to her mouth, which will be dulled with her breath, if ſhe be yet alive; or they ſet a cup full of water upon her breaſt, and if the water ſtir not, they account the party dead. Theſe Signs do for the moſt part hold good, but they are not perpetual, neither do they put the matter paſt diſpute; ſeeing as was ſaid before, ſome VVomen in theſe Fits do live only by Tranſpiration, as thoſe live-wights which live in holes al the winter, and fetch no breath at al by their mouths. VVhich though it very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom fals out, yet it is a very good Caution, not to ſuffer women which die of this Diſeaſe, to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried til the third day after their death, or at leaſt til they begin to ſtink.</p>
                     <p>The Signs of the Cauſes are likewiſe to be declared; which Cauſes we have ſhewed to be three, <hi>viz.</hi> Seed retained and corrupted; Menſtrual Blood in like manner retained and corrupted; and vile humors contained in the veſſels, or in the Cavitie of the womb.</p>
                     <p>If this Diſeaſe ariſe from Seed retained, or corrupted, there have preceeded al thoſe Cauſes, which might encreaſe, gather together, and corrupt the Seed in the veſſels; as flouriſhing age, ripe for Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, or formerly accuſtomed to the actions thereof, which of late it hath left off; Sanguine complexion, an idle life, and given to pleaſures; a rich and plentiful table, with the uſe of ſuch meates as are eaſily corrupted. In ſuch perſons if the womb-Fits happen, they having their Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes wel, we may gueſſe they come from Seed retained.</p>
                     <p>If theſe womb-Fits depend upon the Menſtrual Blood retained and corrupted, as their cauſe; the Patients Courſes are either wholly ſtopt, or flow very little, and to no purpoſe; and ſhe her ſelf is not to ſeek for carnal Embracements: but wel provided; And ſome Symptoms do attend this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, as Melancholly, Waſpiſhneſs, Sluggiſhneſs, Drowſineſs, Head-ach, ſwelling of the Dugs heavineſs of the Loyns and Thighs.</p>
                     <p>That this Diſeaſe comes from evil Humors is known, by the Patient having her Courſes well, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exerciſed ſufficiently with actions of Generation, by her being ſtept into years, or being very ſull of evil Humors, or being troubled with ſome other Diſeaſe in her womb.</p>
                     <p>We muſt alſo ſet down theſe Signs of thoſe other Symptoms which we formerly deſcribed, as ſpringing from the womb.</p>
                     <p>Head-ach coming from the womb is known, becauſe the Patient hath not her Courſes right, the pain does chiefly trouble her, or is moſt increaſed, at, or neer the time of her Courſes flowing, and her womb is out of order. Alſo we may diſtinguiſh whether an Humor, or a Vapor cauſe this pain; for if the pain be not great, heavy, and preſſing, and come by fits; it comes certainly from a Vapor: but if the pain be continual, joyned with heavineſs, it ſhews an Humor contained in the part; which if it be Chollerick, the pain is biting, pricking, and acute or ſharp; if it be Flegmatick, it cauſes ſleepineſs; if Melancholly, Sadneſs.</p>
                     <p>Pantings of the Heart, and beatings of the Arteries about the ſhort Ribs and Back; Diſeaſes of the Stomach, Liver, and Spleen; and divers pains may be conceived to ariſe from the womb, if theſe other Signs and Symptoms of the womb affected, before recited, be likewiſe preſent. As alſo, if by putting ſweet ſmelling things to the water-gate, and ſtinking things to the Noſe, the Patient do find ſome kind of eaſe.</p>
                     <p>What concerns the Prognoſtick, or Predictions of this Diſeaſe; It it is a malady which ſeldom
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:49088:209"/>
kiils the Patients, but uſe; to ſtick a long time by them. But ſomtimes they are in danger of death by reaſon of ſwooning fits that happen, or by ſome extraordinary Convulſion. Likewiſe if the fits are frequent and hard to be removed, it is to be feared, leſt Reſpiration being ſo often hurt, the Native heat ſhould be ſuffocated, and the Patient come to die.</p>
                     <p>The Womb-paiſion is worſt, in which more parts are drawn into conſent; and that is bad which ſprings from corrupted Seed, or from a long ſuppreſſion of the monthly Courſes.</p>
                     <p>In Elderly perſons, this Diſeaſe is hardly curable, becauſe of that plenty of Corruption wherewith they are wont to abound. In yonger VVomen, it commonly ceaſes when they begin to bring forth Children.</p>
                     <p>In VVomen with Child, and that lie in Child-bed, it is a dangerous Diſeaſe; in the former, for fear of Miſcarriage; in the latter, becauſe of their weakneſs after Child-bearing.</p>
                     <p>For a VVoman troubled with theſe VVomb-fits, to ſneeze is good, for it ſignifies ſtrength of Brain; and by the motion of ſneezing, the Malignant Vapors which beſiege the Brain, are diſcuſſed; and likewiſe the vitious Humors contained in the VVomb evacuated.</p>
                     <p>A twofold Cure belongs to this Infirmity: one in the fit, another out of the fit. In the fit, thoſe vapors which cauſe it are to be diſcuſſed and drawn back from the part affected; the Humors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the VVomb which ſend up thoſe Vapors, muſt be voided; and the VVomb when it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of its proper place (which often happens according to <hi>Hippocrates</hi>) muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to the ſame again.</p>
                     <p>Firſt therefore, The ſick party muſt be laid upon a bed in ſuch a poſture, that her Neck and Shoulders lie high and ſloaping, but her Thighs and Privy parts lie low and ſhooting downwards, for ſo the VVomb is more eaſily reduced.</p>
                     <p>Then muſt her lower parts be tied very hard, ſo as to cauſe pain; likewiſe they muſt be well rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed and chaſed; alſo Cupping-glaſſes are to be ſet upon her Hips; and a very large Cupping-glaſs ſet upon her Share is very profitable. But take heed that you do not apply a Cupping-glaſs upon the Patients Navel, which many ignorantly are wont to do, for by that means the VVomb is drawn upwards again. VVhen Convulſions happen, or ſwooning fits, hard rubbings with courſe cloaths are good upon the ſoals of the Feet, alſo with Vinegar and Salt; it is good likewiſe to pluck off ſome Hairs from the Head and Share, to cramp the fingers or the Patient, whoop aloud in her ears, and ſuch like.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo good to lay unto the ſoals of her Feet, this Epiſpaſtick, or drawing Cataplaſm or Pultis.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Leaves of Artemiſia (Mugwort) Feaverfew, Rhue, of each a handful: Sage, half a handful: Pidgeons dung poudered three ounces: Black Soap an ounce and an half: Amber, Frankinſence, Maſticb poudered, of each a dram and an half: Juyce of Rue, and Vinegar, allay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Water, as much as ſufficeth to make all into a Cataplaſm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At the ſame time, ſtinking and ſtrong ſmelling things are to be put unto her Noſe; as Partridg fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers burnt, old Leather burnt, and Brimſtone fired, Jeat or Agate Oyl, a Pomander of Aſſafoetida, Caſtoreum, Galbanum, Rue, moiſtened with Syrup of Artemiſia, or with Vinegar; Garlands of Rue, Tanzy, Wormwood. But if the VVoman be Epileptick, or ſubject to the Falling-ſickneſs, we muſt abſtain from the ſtronger things before mentioned, becauſe the Brain being therewith offended, is put into a Commotion, by which means the Humors are tumbled ſuddenly into the Ventricles thereof, and the Syptomes are made more grievous.</p>
                     <p>The ſmoak of Tobacco blown into the Mouth and Noſtrils of the Patient, does quickly free her from the fit.</p>
                     <p>Contrarywiſe, ſweet ſmelling things muſt be put unto the VVomb, as ſome grains of Musk or Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet wrapped in Cotton-wool.</p>
                     <p>The following Pouder may be blown up her Noſtrils.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>white Pepper, Muſtard ſeed, Pellitory, Caſtoreum, of each one ſcruple; make it into a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fine Pouder.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the Patient be very much oppreſſed with her fit, let her be provoked to ſneeze, according to that Aphoriſm of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> his 5. Section, 35. <hi>To a Woman troubled with Womb-fits, or hard Labor, if ſhe happen to neeze it is good.</hi> Neezing is many times provoked by the foreſaid Pouder; and if that alone will not do it, a little white Hellebore, or Euphorbium may be added.</p>
                     <p>Alſo Oyl of Amber or Agates, may be anointed upon her Noſtrils.</p>
                     <p>But laxative and wind-expelling Clyſters do exceed all other Medicaments, in diſcuſſing ſuch filthy Vapors as cauſe the fit: which may be made after this manner:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Mercury Leaves, Pellitory of the wall, Mugwort, Penyroyal, Rue, Calaminth, of each one handful: Caraway ſeeds, Cummin ſeeds, and Bayberries, of each two drams: Boyl all to a pint and an half. In the ſtraining diſſolve</hi> Hiera Picra, <hi>and</hi> Benedicta laxativa, <hi>of each ſix drams: Oyl of Rue three ounces: Camphire half a ſcruple. Mix all into a Clyſter.</hi>

                     <p>Take <hi>Oyl of Rue four ounces: Aqua vitae one ounce: Canary Sack three quarters of a pint: Galbanum two drams: Mix all, and make a Clyſter, and adminiſter the ſame after a Laxative Clyſter.</hi>

                     <p>A Clyſter of Vinegar, tempered with Water, does preſently aſſwage the Mother-ſit, by compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and coagulating the vapors, which cauſe the ſame.</p>
                     <p>The ſame does a draught of Vinegar allaied with water, being taken in at the mouth. Authors do likewiſe counſel that the Patients belly above the Navel, be ſtrongly girt with a ſwath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, that the womb may be thereby reduced, and the vapors hindred from aſcending.</p>
                     <p>Concerning letting blood, it is a great queſtion, Whether it be convenient in the ſit, or no? For ſeeing there is at that time a great weakneſs in the Patient and ſomtimes deſpair of life, and the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is cooled all over by malignant vapors which infeſt the Brain and Heart, which can no waies be expelled by blood-letting; no queſtion the uſe thereof is very dangerous during the fits. And of this Opinion are <hi>Varandaeus</hi> and <hi>Sennertus.</hi> But <hi>Mercatus</hi> and <hi>Rodericus a Caſtro,</hi> do determine contrarily, That a Vein ought to be opened in the Patients Ankle or Inſtep, when the Diſeaſe ſprings from an abundance of Menſtrual blood retained; and that the Patients ſtrength oppreſſed with the burden, the paſſages obſtructed with too much blood, and the danger of ſuffocation hence ariſing, can be remedied by no other means but bleeding; ſeeing in this caſe, neither ſtinking ſmels, nor ſweet ſmels, nor Cupping-Glaſſes, can bring the Patient out of her fit. <hi>Philippus Hoechſtetterus</hi> in the ſecond part of his Obſervations, makes it appear by certain Hiſtories, that bleeding in the Foot hath done much good: Inſomuch, as a certain Nun, which had been ſpeechleſs, and in Convulſion fits for two daies together, two hours after ſhe had bled began to ſpeak, and to eat and drink. Iam of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, a Vein may be opened, if the Pulſe be ſtrong, and there be evident tokens that blood doth ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-abound: But if the Pulſe be weak, we muſt forbear, and ſtay till the fit is over for a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient ſeaſon, in which blood may be ſafely taken away.</p>
                     <p>Plaiſters are profitably applied under the Navel of the Maſs of <hi>Emplaſtrum Ceroneum,</hi> which mollifies and diſcuſſeth, and ſo is better than the vulgar Womb-Plaiſter, which doth ſomwhat bind, and therefore may retain the vapors and malignant humors. Plaiſters are likewiſe made of Galba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num and Aſſafoetida, or of Caranna, and Tacamahaca, either alone, or with ſome Spices mingled with them. As for Example:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Gum Caranna half an ounce: Pouder of Nutmegs, and Cloves, of each half a dram: Oyl of Amber four drops: Turpentine two drams. Make all into a Plaiſter. Such Plaiſters are to be in faſhion of a Shield or Scutcheon. and in the pointed part of the Plaiſter, which muſt be laid towards the Water-gate, ſome of Musk or Civet are to be put, that they may ſend forth a ſweet ſmell, and thereby allure the Womb back again. Three grains of Musk may be put in a little Cotton, moiſtened with Oyl, and thruſt into the hole of the Navel: then lay on a ſinal Plaiſter of diſſolved Galbanum. This ſome Women for a Secret.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or four grains of Camphire may be diſſolved in Oyl of ſweet Almonds, and put into the Navel, and a Diapalma Plaiſter laid over it.</p>
                     <p>If the Diſeaſe ſeem to be foſtered by plenty of wind and vapors, Fomentations and Baths will be good, of the Decoction of Rue, Mugwort, Time, and Calaminth, Fennel ſeed, Annis ſeed Cummin ſeed, Bay-berries, Chamomel Flowers, Dill flowers, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Alſo little bags may be prepared with Cummin ſeed, Annis ſeed, Carrot ſeed, Salt, Rue, Bran, in them, and applied very hot, and often renewed Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Oyl of Rue four ounces: Spirit of Turpentine half an ounce: Mingle them, and dip therein a piece of Bread hot out of the Oven, and lay it upon the Navel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Alſo it will be good to anoint the lower part of the belly, the Region of the womb, Share, and Loyns; becauſe ſuch anointings do dilate the Paſſages, attenuate the Vapors, and diſcuſs them. They may be made of Nard Oyl, Spike Oyl, Oyl of Dill, Seſamine, Saffron, Lillies, and Sweet Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds.</p>
                     <p>Authors do very much commend a fume of the warts which grow upon Horſes Legs; which being dried in an Oven, and beaten to Pouder, they are burnt under the Noſes of women in theſe fits as a preſent Remedy, whereby women are wont to be in an inſtant delivered of their fits, to the admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the by-ſtanders.</p>
                     <p>If the Diſeaſe ſpring from Retention of Seed, nothing is better than carnal Conjunction, as ſoon as the Patient is out of her fit, if ſhe be married.</p>

And when I underſtood, that ſhe was wont to be troubled with thoſe Fits oftentimes, I injoyned her to wear a piece of Elks Claw continually about her Neck: Which when ſhe diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerved, for the ſpace of three months that I was in the place, ſhe was ever free from thoſe Fits, and gave me often times thanks for my advice.</hi>

                     <p>Two moſt excellent Remedies may be made in the form of Pouders, which I have oftentimes tried.</p>
                     <p>The one is of the After-birth of a woman that lies in of her firſt Child, dried in the Chimney, and beaten to pouder. The Doſe is a dram in ſome convenient liquor. It preſently takes away the fit.</p>
                     <p>The other is made of two parts of Brimſtone, and one of Nutmeg. Pouder them and give a dram.</p>
                     <p>Pouder of Jeat given to half a dram, or one dram, will do much.</p>
                     <p>The Pouder of Elder-berries of Quercetanus taken a dram in Wine, cures the Eplilepſie, or Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-ſickneſs, by conſent of the Womb, and being taken the ſecond time, makes that the fits return not.</p>
                     <p>Where that Pouder cannot be had, the ſame quantity of Soot from the Chimney, may be given in an Egg ſoft boiled.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe the Womb is oftentimes filled with evil, and Excrementious Humors, from whence ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Vapors are raiſed up; we muſt be careful to purge the ſame, which may be moſt conveniently done by this following Peſſarie.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Diaphoenicon one dram: pouder of Hiera picra half a dram: Turpentine three drams: mix all, and with Tow make a Peſſary.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For her ordinary drink let the Patient drink a thin weak Decoction of Cinnamon, Caraway, or Annis ſeeds.</p>
                     <p>Touching Wine, It is a queſtion whether it may be given a Woman in theſe fits. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his firſt Book of the Nature of Women ſeems to commend the ſame: and there is much reaſon to back his opinion. For an extream refrigeration of the Body, and Languiſhment of natural ſtrength, cannot be better holpen, than by giving the Patient a Cup of rich Canary. But <hi>Avicenna</hi> wholly forbids it. And indeed, Becauſe this Diſeaſe depends for the moſt part upon Seed retained, or of Blood and foul Vapors carried up from the Womb: Wine by it's thinneſs, and exceeding piercing faculty, doth more exagitate and vex the morbifical matter. Whence we ſee by common Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that Women troubled with this Diſeaſe, are worſe if Wine be given in their fits. To Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this Contention, we ſay; that Wine ordinarily is not to be given during the fit, but upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary occaſion: Namely when the Patients ſtrength is extreamly decai'd, ſhe hath Swooning fits joyned with the Mother fits, or ſeems to be at the laſt gaſp: all other Remedies tried in vain, we make uſe of Wine as our laſt Refuge, and preſent help.</p>
                     <p>In this Cure we muſt be very careful, if the Patient be with Child, and prudent in our adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Medicaments; neither muſt we uſe thoſe more vehement and ſtinking ones, leaſt we cauſe miſcarriage; and we muſt perform the Cure rather by outward than inward Medicaments.</p>
                     <p>In the Courſe of the Cure, care muſt be taken of the Heart and Brain, and if they ſeem much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, they muſt be releived by ſuch Medicines as are proper unto them. To the Heart, Wine, and Orange-flower-water, or Imperial water, or Treacle of Andromachus diſſolved in Wine, muſt be applied by wetting things therein, and laying them upon the Region thereof; or hot living Creatures are to be applied thereunto. For to ſtrengthen the Head, thoſe Remedies muſt be uſed, which are ſet down in our Chapter of ſleepy Diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>When the fit is over, Care muſt be taken to prevent the return thereof, either wholly, or at leaſt for a long time: which is done by a removal of the Cauſes, and by ſtrengthening the Womb.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place therefore at a convenient ſeaſon; but eſpecially in the Spring and Fall, the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent muſt be yeerly evacuated, beginning with a purging Potion, or ſome other Medicament ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the nature of the Patient; alwaies adding Hyſterical things.</p>
                     <p>And then, If Blood ſeem ſuperfluous, it muſt be drawn firſt out of the Arm, and then out of the Foot; chooſing as neer as poſſibly the middle ſpace between the Patients monthly purgations.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards, That the redundancy of evil Humors may be ſufficiently prepared and purged out, an Apozeme muſt be compounded, altering, opening, and purging, to be given at four or five times.</p>
                     <p>If Nature ſeem to incline to the opening of the Hemorrhoids, they muſt be opened by applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Leeches. And <hi>Mercatus</hi> doth witneſs in his 13. and 14. Counſel, that they have much profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in theſe fits.</p>
                     <p>After general purgation, to diſcuſs the remainders of the morbifical matter, a ſweating Decoction will be good to give divers daies together; made of Saſſafras, Guajacum, with ſeeds of Fennel, Rue, and Agnus Caſtus.</p>
                     <p>To the ſame intent Sulphurous, and Bitumenous Baths will be very good, ſuch as we have at <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leruca,</hi> by whoſe uſe many are holpen, as daily experience ſhews.</p>

                     <p>Neither muſt we omit ſuch Medicaments, which are wont to help theſe fits by a peculiar property thought to be in them: An Example whereof may be this that follows, made in Pills, becauſe of the ungrateful taſte of the Simples.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Aſſafoetida half a ſcruple: Caſtoreum, Mirrh, Galbanum, Sagapenum, of each one ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. With Honey of Mercury make a Maſs; of which give the Patient half a ſcruple, or a ſcruple frequently.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Platerus</hi> makes Pills of extreamly odoriferous Ingredients, after this manner:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of Musk ſix grains: Benjamin half a dram: Sugar one dram: With Cinnamon Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter make them into a Maſs for Pills. The Doſe is half a ſcruple.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thoſe Hyſterical Waters before ſet down to be given in the fits, may likewiſe be profitably uſed out of the fits, a ſpoonful or two in a morning, when the Patient is free, by way of prevention.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mathiolus</hi> extreamly commends the Briony Root, in theſe words: <hi>Briony doth wonderfully help Women ſubject to ſtrangulations of the Womb, ſo as to free them from their choaking fits, and cure them. Truly I knew a Woman, dayly almoſt vexed with theſe fits for a yeer together, who being at laſt taught by an ordinary Herb-man, to drink white Wine, wherein an ounce of Briony Root had been boyled, once in a week, when ſhe was going to bed: when ſhe had uſed this Medicine for a yeer together, ſhe was perfectly recovered of that Diſeaſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Liver of a Wolf dried, and one dram taken, may prevent the fits of the Falling-ſickneſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the Mother, if it be given three or four times after an ordinary Purgation.</p>
                     <p>The Chymiſts do commend <hi>Vitriolum Martis</hi> [that is, Vitriolated Steel, or chalybeated Vitriol, or Salt of Steel] whereof they give a grain or two, with a double quantity of Sugar, many daies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in Wine or other fitting Liquor.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="431" facs="tcp:49088:211"/>And the Truth is, it may be given to twelve, fifteen, and twenty grains in ſome convenient Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve; or it may be made into Pills, with Mucilage of Gum Tragacanth.</p>
                     <p>Cream of Tartar frequently taken, is alſo very good in the Cure of this Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>Theſe two Medicines do good, not only by opening, but alſo by cooling; for oftentimes an hot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper is rooted in the womb of VVomen ſubject to this Diſeaſe, ariſing from Blood retained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in its Veins, and over-heated; as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaies in Hypochondriacal Melancholly, That there is a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning diſtemper in the Parts under the ſhort Ribs, by reaſon of blood retained in them by obſtructions, and there over-heated. Thoſe things therefore which have power to cool the Womb, are very proper in this caſe, ſuch as are Baths to ſit in, Vinegar and Water mingled and drunk down, or injected, and ſuch like. Unto which we may add the Hiſtory related by Dr. <hi>Harvey,</hi> touching the Childing of a woman long afflicted with womb-fits, not curable by all that could be done; who at length, after many yeers, was cured by means of the falling out of her womb: Becauſe her Womb expoſed to the Air was cooled, and ſo its Inflamation and hot diſtemper was repreſſed.</p>
                     <p>Alſo the uſe of Steel it ſelf is much commended by ſome Practitioners, as very convenient for all Infirmities of the VVomb. VVhoſe Preparations look for in our Cure of Obſtructions of the Liver.</p>
                     <p>Iſſues made in the Thighs, are likewiſe very good. For they derive and turn aſide evil Humors from the womb, by reaſon of thoſe Veins which are common to the womb and Thighs.</p>
                     <p>Neither are Amulets to be neglected, faſtened about the Patients Neck, and hanging down upon her Navel, as we formerly mentioned touching the Elks Claw, good in this caſe.</p>
                     <p>Some commend Peucedanum, or Hog-fennel root, hung in a ſtring about the Neck. And our women do with good ſucceſs, wear a piece of Aſſafoetida in a thin rag of cloth. I have known ſome that have worn a Foxes Pizzle and Stones dried, tied about their Neck in a ſtring, and reſting upon their Navel, and by that means preſerved themſelves from the womb-fits.</p>
                     <p>Some wear a piece of Wolfs fleſh dried, or of the Liver of a Wolf, not without profit.</p>
                     <p>As for external Remedies after every Purge, or at leaſt once in a month, eight or ten daies before the monthly Purgations of blood, Fomentations or Baths to ſit in will be good, that the Humor cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this Diſeaſe being reſolved, may more eaſily find its way by the opened Paſſages of the Courſes, and flow out with them. They may be made of the Roots of Marſh-mallows, Briony Roots, Orris Roots, Madder, Valerian, Angelica, Mugwort Leaves, Nep, Feverfew, Bawm, Bayberries, and ſuch like.</p>
                     <p>To diſcuſs the remainders of the Matter cauſing the Diſeaſe, and to ſtrengthen the Womb after Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, or fitting in a Bath, as aforeſaid, the following Plaiſter may be ſaid on under the Navel.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Gum Tacamahacca and Caranna, of each two drams: Alipta Moſchata half an ounce: Agnus Caſtus ſeeds, one dram and an half: of each of the Sanders half a dram: Turpentine, Lab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum, Wax, of each as much as ſhall ſuffice to make a Plaiſter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If this Diſeaſe ariſe from the Seed retained, uſe thoſe Remedies which we have formerly ſet down to quench and diſcuſs Seed in our Cure of Womb-Fury.</p>

                        <hi>Chap. 7.</hi> Of Inflamation of the Womb.</head>
                     <p>INflamation of the Womb, is a Tumor or ſwelling of that Part, ſpringing from blood that is ſhed into the ſubſtance thereof.</p>
                     <p>And the ſaid Inflamation poſſeſſes either the whol Womb, or ſome part thereof; and it is produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced either by pure blood, and is called meerly <hi>Phlegmont,</hi> an Inflamation; or it comes from blood mingled with Choller, and it is called <hi>Phlegmone eryſipelatodes,</hi> a chollerick Inflamation of kin to the Roſe, or St. Anthonies fire; or it hath its original from blood mingled with flegm, and is called <hi>Phlegmone oedematodes,</hi> a flegmatick Inflamation; or it comes from blood mingled with Melanchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and is called <hi>Phlegmone Scirrhodes,</hi> which is a Melanchollick Inflamation or Swelling.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes which produce or encreaſe this Diſeaſe, may be divers; viz. A Sanguine Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion over loaded with blood, or infected with choller; a natural looſneſs of the womb w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> wideneſs of the paſſages, air extream hot, inflaming the humors, or very cold compacting &amp; knitting them together, and ſo ſtopping the monthly Courſes flowing, or ready to flow; vehement Exerciſe, immoderate car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Conjunctions, a blow or fall lighting upon the Wombs Quarters; Perturbations of Mind more violent than ordinary, eſpecially wrath; acrimonious or ſharp vehement meats, of a hot nature, and whatever elſe is taken in of a fretting and vehement operation, as Authors report of Cantharides, That they are very hurtful as well to the womb as the bladder; ſharp Peſſaries long time uſed, or purging Medicines, or ſtrong alteratives, ſuch as barren women are wont to take and rend from all quarters; Retention of the Courſes encreaſing the over fulneſs of blood; or over great flux of Courſes relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                        </gap> bearing of a Child in the Womb.</p>
                     <p>The Signs to know the Diſeaſe by, are, Swelling, Heat, and Pain in the Region of the Womb, with a continual Feaver. But becauſe the ſtrait Gut (that is, that which is united to the Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate) and the Bladder, do lodg in the ſame quarters with the Womb, therfore muſt we diſtinguiſh this Diſeaſe by other ſigns: ſuch are, Suppreſſion or diminution of the Courſes, and their paleneſs or yellowiſh citrine color, with pain in their coming forth; and in the abſence of the Courſes certain ſtinking and rotten ſtuff ſweats through the Veſſels of the Womb, and bedews the VVater-Gate. Whereinto if ſearch be made, it will plainly diſcover the Diſeaſe; for the inner mouth of the womb will be ſound to ſwell, to be drawn inwards, and ſubject to pain if touched; the neck of the womb will appear red and inflamed, the Veins diſperſed there-through, ſtrutting with blood.</p>
                     <p>If the whol Womb be inflamed, all Symptomes will be more vehement. If the Inflamation be rather in the neck of the womb, the heat and pain is ſpread moſt towards the Groyns and the Water-Gate. If the former ſide of the womb do ſuffer, the Bladders fellow-ſeeing wil be the greater: If the hinder ſide of the Womb be inflamed, the ſtrait Gut will be more compaſſionate, and the pain wil ſtretch itſelf towards the Loyns. If the right or left ſide of the womb be inflamed, the heat and pain wil appear moſt about the one Groyn; and the Thigh of the ſame ſide wil be heavy, and as it were in a ſort burdened.</p>
                     <p>The Signs of the Cauſes are theſe. If the Inflamation ſpring from pure blood, al the Symptomes are milder; but if there be Choller mingled therewith, the Feaver is more burning, and al the Symptomes are more vehement; but if the blood be Flegmatick or Melanchollick, the Feaver wil be leſs acute, but the Diſeaſe more laſting, and more ſtubborn. And here we are to conſider ſuch Signs as may inform us what Humor is moſt predominant in the whol Body.</p>
                     <p>If the Inflamation turn to an Impoſthume and gather Matter, the pain and Feaver are encreaſed, and ſhaking ſits come without any certain courſe, yet commonly they take their turn about Evening. And al the other Symptomes are heightened. When Suppreſſion is accompliſhed, al the Symptomes are mitigated, and Swelling riſes higher, whereby ſomtimes the Excrement of the Guts, or Urine is ſtopped. But if the Inflamation be diſcuſſed without Suppuration, the Swelling leſſens, and the Symptomes becomes gentler.</p>
                     <p>If it turn to a Scirrhus (that is, hard ſwelling) the Feaver, Pain, and other Symptomes are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed; the Swelling abides, becomes harder; likewiſe the weight and heavineſs remain, both in the womb, and the adjacent parts, ſo that the Patient can hardly ſtir her ſelf.</p>
                     <p>A good Prognoſtick cannot be made of this Diſeaſe becauſe it is very dangerous, and for the moſt part deadly. But more or leſs danger is threatened according to the greatneſs of the Diſeaſe, its Cauſes and Symptomes, as thus:</p>
                     <p>If the Inflamation poſſeſs the whol Womb, its a deſperate Diſeaſe; but if only a part be inflamed, there is ſome hope of help.</p>
                     <p>If a VVoman with Child have a Chollerick ſwelling in her womb, its deadly. <hi>Hipp.</hi> Aphor. 43. Sect. 5. For the Child dies by reaſon of the greatneſs of the Inflamation, whereupon follows Abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which coming upon the back of a grievous diſeaſe, kils the Mother. <hi>Galen</hi> in his Comments upon this Aphoriſm, doubts if this be not true of every Inflamation of the womb as well as of the Chollerick, and whether it be poſſible that a Child in ſuch a caſe can live.</p>
                     <p>Inflamation of the womb eaſily degenerates into a Gangrene, Becauſe the womb, as it were the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies Cloſe-ſtool, receives a mighty charge of naſty Excrements, by which the inbred heat is eaſily ſuffocated.</p>
                     <p>Ravings, turning of the womb, Hiccoughs, Coldneſs of the Hands and Feet, Diaphoretick ſweat ſeizing on a woman in this Diſeaſe, do portend ſudden death.</p>
                     <p>If an Inflamation of the womb come to Suppuration, its hopeful that it may be cured; but a foul Ulcer will follow, which wil make the Patient to pine away with a lingering Feaver, or to fall into the Dropſie.</p>
                     <p>If the Inflamation turn into a Scirrhus, the evil becomes laſting, and often brings a Dropſie.</p>
                     <p>To cure this Infirmity, the Courſe of the Blood to the Womb is to be drawn back, it is to be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from the womb, it is to be diverted another way: that which is flown in and contained in the part, is to be reſolved. And if the ſwelling tend to ſuppuration, it is to be furthered, and when it is broken, the Matter or Quittor muſt be voided out; Which may be done by the following Remedies.</p>
                     <p>An Emollient and cooling Clyſter being premiſed, let Blood be drawn from the Baſilick Vein of the Arm, on that ſide on which the Womb is moſt affected; or from both Arms, if the ſwelling be in
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:49088:212"/>
the whol Womb; and let the Blood-letting be repeated twice, thrice, or four times, according to the ſtrength of the Patient, and the greatneſs of the Inflamation.</p>
                     <p>After ſufficient Revulſion, the Diſeaſe being come to its height, when there is no longer ſuſpition of any preſent flux into the Womb, the lower Veins are to be opened, to derive from the part affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. In which ſence we muſt underſtand, <hi>Galen</hi> in his Book of Blood-letting, and in his 13. Book of the Method of Healing, where he teacheth, That in the Inflamation of the Womb, we muſt open the Veins about the Knees and Anckles. But ſo long as there remains any Indication of Revulſion, it is better to open the Veins of the Arm.</p>
                     <p>Alſo to revel or draw back the Humors, Frictions are good, and Ligatures or bindings of the uper parts, and Cupping-Glaſſes ſet upon the Shoulders, Loyns, and Back.</p>
                     <p>If vitious Humors (eſpecially Chollerick) do abound in the Body, which are as it were the Coach of the other Humors to hurry them about the Body; they are to be evacuated with gentle Medicaments, as Syrup of Roſes, and Syrup of Violets ſolutive, Manna, Rhubarb, Catholicon, or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuary Lenitive; for ſtronger Medicaments by ſtirring the Humors over much, would excite the Flux of Humors more abundantly to the part affected.</p>
                     <p>And vomiting Medicaments, though preſcribed by <hi>Avicenna,</hi> ſeem no way convenient in this caſe: For if they be mild and gentle, they evacuate nothing to ſpeak of: If they be ſtronger, they cauſe a great Agitation in the Body, by which means the Humors being in a Commotion, may flow more plentifully unto the part diſeaſed.</p>
                     <p>In regard of the greatneſs of the Feaver, cooling Medicaments are to be uſed, as Juleps and Emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; whereunto, if very great wakings, pain, and tumblings and toſſings do diſquiet the Patient, ſome Narcoticks may be added, which may likewiſe be given by themſelves.</p>
                     <p>After the Firſt Evacuations, let outward Medicines be applied to the lower part of the Belly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Navel and the Share, and about the Kidneys; firſt of all repelling and cooling things, in the form of a Liniment, an Epithem, and Cataplaſm.</p>
                     <p>The Liniment may be made of Oyl of Roſes waſhed in Vinegar, or of Oyntment of Roſes, <hi>Cera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Santalinum,</hi> or <hi>Galens</hi> cooling Oyntment, with a little Vinegar added.</p>
                     <p>The Epitheme may be made of the Waters or Decoction of Plantane, Sorrel, Nightſhade, the tops of white Poppies and Roſes, adding a little Bole-Armoniack, Dragons Blood, and <hi>Terra Sigil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lata.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Cataplaſm or Pultiſs may be made of the Crums of fine Manchet boyled with Milk, to which a little Oyl of Roſes may be added, with Juyce of Henbane. Nightſhade, and the whites of Eggs; or of Barley Meal, Linſeed, Fenugreek ſeed, with Oyl of Roſes; whereunto likewiſe the aforeſaid Plants being bruiſed may be added.</p>
                     <p>Injections muſt be made into the Womb, compounded after this manner:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Plantane Leaves, Water-lilly Leaves, Nightſhade, and Endive, of each one handful: red Roſes two pugils. Boyl all till a third part of the Water be conſumed: and add to the ſtrainings Oyl of Mirtles one ounce: Vinegar half an ounce. Make an Inje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of the ſame Herbs bruiſed with Oyl of Roſes and Vinegar, Peſſaries may be made, and put into the Womb.</p>
                     <p>Neither muſt Repelling, and Refrigerating Medicaments be long uſed, leſt the Swelling harden and degenerate into a Scirrhus. Wherefore ſoftening and diſcuſſing things are to be mingled with the repelling Simples; with this Proviſo, That the longer the Inflamation is from its Infancy, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter muſt be the quantity of Digeſtives. So that to the foreſaid Medicaments may be added, Mallows, Marſh-mallows, Mugwort, Fenugreek, Chamomel Melilot; their Doſe being augmented or dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, as the caſe ſhall require.</p>
                     <p>In the mean while, if the Patient be coſtive, ſhe muſt be helped by gentle Purgatives. Yea, and the truth is, frequent Clyſters may do a great deal of good to temper the Inflamation, ſeeing the Womb reſts upon the ſtreight Gut, called <hi>Inteſtinum reotum.</hi> But let them be little in quantity, that they may be kept the longer, and that they may not compreſs the Womb; of which this may be an Example.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Marſh-mallow Roots, the Leaves of Mallows, Violets, Lettice, of each one handful: Nightſhade half a handful: Violet flowers, red Roſes, of each a pugil: ſowr Prunes, ten: boyl them in Barley Water. In ſix ounces of the ſtrained Broth mix three ounces of Oyl of Roſes, and make all into a Clyſter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the Patient be in great pain, to the aforeſaid Clyſters may be added, the Yolks of Eggs, the fat of an Hen, Breaſt-milk, Mucilage of the ſeeds of Fenugreek, Lin-ſeed, or Mallows; yea, and a little quantity of Opium, with ſome Saffron.</p>
                     <p>In ſuch a caſe, Injections into the Womb may likewiſe be made, of Goats or Sheeps Milk, with O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium and Saffron, of each three or four grains, and a little Roſe Water.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="434" facs="tcp:49088:213"/>Or unto Peſſaries may be added a little Opium with a little Saffron, the whites of Eggs, and Oyl of Roſes. Or Peſſaries may be made of <hi>Philonium Romanum</hi> with Cotton. Or a Fomentation to eaſe pain, may be prepared on this manner:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Marſh-mallows Branch and Root, Violet Leaves, of each a handful: Chamomel, Meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, Roſes, of each a pugil. Boyl all for a Fomentation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When the Diſeaſe begins to decline, Purgation is to be iterated with gentle Purgatives. And when the Diſeaſe tends to a Reſolution or Concluſion (which is known by remiſſion of the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes, and becauſe the part is not ſo oppreſſed with any Heavineſs) Diſcuſſives muſt be uſed in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter quantity than any of the foregoing Medicaments. Or this Cataplaſm may be made.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Pouder of Marſh-mallow Roots one ounce: Chamomel and Melilot flowers, of each two drams: Mugwort Leaves poudered, Barley and Bean meal, of each half an ounce: boyl them a little in harſh red Wine; add new Hogs Greaſe, Oyl of Chamomel and Lillies, of each one ounce. Make a Pultiſs or Cataplaſm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fomentations and Baths to ſit in, may likewiſe do good in this caſe.</p>
                     <p>If the ſwelling cannot be diſcuſſed, but ſeem to tend to ſuppuration, it is to be furthered by the following Cataplaſm:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Marſh-mallow Roots poudered, Chamomel flowers, Melilot, Meal of Lin-ſeed, Fenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greek, of each one ounce: fat Figs, eight: boyl all to the conſiſtence of a Pultiſs. Then add the yolks of four Eggs: Saffron half a ſcruple: Oyl of Lillies and freſh Butter, of each an ounce. Make of all a Cataplaſm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When Matter or Quittor is made, which may be known by the abatement of heat and pain, and by a certain inundation perceivable by the touch, the Matter quaking like a quagmire, endeavor muſt be uſed to break the Impoſthume by moving of the Body, by coughing, by neezing, by faſtening Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping-glaſſes, by clenſing and attenuating Injections, or by Peſſaries that wil draw and break. As for Example.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Gooſe-Greaſe half an ounce: Turpentine two drams: Rue ſeeds poudered, Nitre, Orice Roots, of each half a dram. Mix all, and with Wool make a Peſſary.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When the Impoſthume is broke, we muſt endeavor to purge out the Quittor or Matter, and to clenſe and conſolidate or cloſe up the Ulcer, as ſhall be ſhewed in the Cure of an Ulcer of the Womb, in the Chapter immediately following.</p>

                     <p>AFter a ſuppurated Inflamation of the Womb, follows an Ulcer, which likewiſe depends upon other Cauſes, namely, ſo many as may cauſe an Eroſion, fretting, or gnawing the ſubſtance of the Womb.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes therefore hereof are, An Impoſthume breaking, Sharp Humors flowing into the Womb, Sharp and Corroſive Medicines conveyed into the Womb, or taken at the Mouth, as was ſaid before touching Cantharides or Spaniſh Flyes.</p>
                     <p>The Antecedent Cauſes are all ſuch things, which we have formerly ſhewed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have power to cauſe an Inflamation, as difficult Child-birth, violent and unbridled Carnal Conjunction, a long flux of Sharp Humors from the Womb, wounds, fals, and bruiſes, and eſpecially a venemous Gonorrhea, and the Lechers Pocks, the infection whereof is ſoon communicated to the Womb, and its Neck.</p>
                     <p>The Differences of this Diſeaſe, are taken from the place, the magnitude, the figure and complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with other Infirmities.</p>
                     <p>In reſpect of the place, that is to ſay, the ſeveral parts of the Womb; the Ulcer is ſomtimes poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of the Neck of the Womb, and its inner Orifice; ſomtimes it is in the bottom, though but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Somtimes, and that moſt frequently, it ſeizes the inner ſurface of the Womb; ſomtimes, but ſeldom, it aſſaults the outer ſurface; whence it comes to paſs, that ſomtimes the Quittor of theſe Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers comes out by the Bladder or Guts, or if it ſettle in the Cavity of the Abdomen, Impoſthumes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe about the Patients Groyns, of which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſpeaks in his 47. Aphor. Sect. 5.</p>
                     <p>In reſpect of Quantity, ſome are great, others ſmal Ulcers, according as they take up more or leſs ſpace in the Womb; which if they be little and ſuperficial, they differ little from the Scab and Itch; but if they be great, grievous, and as it were devouring, they are called by <hi>Hippocrates, Nomae,</hi> that is, eating Ulcers.</p>
                     <p>In regard of their Figure, Ulcers are called Round, Long, Hollow, or Fiſtulous, that is, like a Pipe.</p>
                     <p>In regard of Complication with other Infirmities, they are called Phlegmonous, Cancerous, Scir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhous, Painful, VVater-bloodiſh, Poyſonous, and Infectious.</p>
                     <p>The Signs of an Ulcer bred in the VVomb, are, Pain and biting in the womb or its neck, voiding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <pb n="435" facs="tcp:49088:213"/>
of ſnotty Matter or Quittor out of the Womb, which Diagnoſis wil be more illuſtrated, if the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes producing the Ulcer, ſuch as we have muſtered up, have preceded.</p>
                     <p>If the Ulcer poſſeſs the neck of the womb, it is diſcerned by the ſight, by help of the Womb per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Inſtrument; alſo by the Midwi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>es hand or in the genial Embracement, in which the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient feels a troubleſom pain, But if the Ulcer be in the bottom of the Womb, the pain is felt about the Share, and the Excrements flow more abundantly.</p>
                     <p>If the Ulcer pierce to the outward ſurface, the Patients Urines or Stools appear Matteriſh, or a Fluctuation is perceived in the Paunch, or a Swelling towards the Groyns, where it threatens to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſthumate.</p>
                     <p>If the Ulcer be ſingle and benign, the Quittor is little, white, and not ſtinking. But if it be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant and eating, the Quittor will be greeniſh, Lead colored, and party-colored, coming away with great pain and ſtink.</p>
                     <p>If it ſhall ariſe of the Lechers Pox, Gonorrhoea will uſher it in, or attend upon it, and other tokens of the Whore-maſters Pox will appear.</p>
                     <p>For the Prognoſticks of this Infirmity, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in the firſt Book of Womens Sickneſſes, ſaies, That no Ulcer in the Womb ought to be ſlighted, becauſe it is in a part of exquiſite feeling, which hath a fellow feeling with the principal parts of the Body, and is very much diſpoſed to receive a flood of Excrements from them.</p>
                     <p>If the Ulcers of the VVomb prove Cancerous, Phagedenick, or VVolf-iſh [ſuch as we ſimple people cal the VVoolf, and tel ſtrange tales about, how it eats fleſh, &amp;c.] hollow, or fiſtulous, they are for the moſt part incurable, and do vex the poor Patients miſerably, all their life long.</p>
                     <p>Ulcers in the Neck of the VVomb are more eaſily cured, becauſe Medicaments may be applied to them immediately.</p>
                     <p>In women that are recovering of this Diſeaſe, it is a token of perfect health, if they begin to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and conveniently to receive the Mans Sperm, or if they have their monthly Courſes orderly and without pain.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of a womb Ulcer, muſt tend to hinder the flowing in of ſuch Humors as either beget or cheriſh the Ulcer, and to clenſe the Ulcer, and cauſe it to come to a coalition. To which purpoſe the following Remedies may be uſed.</p>
                     <p>And firſt of all, If the Patient be over ful of blood, or the Ulcer have an Inflamation joyned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, a Vein in the Arm muſt be opened, and repeated ſo often as there ſeems danger of a new Fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which is eſpecially to be done when the Patient hath her Courſes, that they may flow the leſs, becauſe they are wont to ſupply Matter to the Ulcer, and to cauſe other Humors to flow unto the womb.</p>
                     <p>Alſo Purgation is very neceſſary, that the Body may be freed from evil Humors; and it ought to be procured by the gentler ſort of Purgatives, as Senna, Rhubarb, Tamarinds, Myrobalans, Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum, and ſuch like; and Purgation is often to be repeated, that evil Humors may be diverted from the womb, and it is in this caſe of ſuch moment, that <hi>Foreſtus</hi> witneſſeth in the 48. Obſervation of his 28. Book, That <hi>John Tiengius,</hi> a Phyſitian of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> cured a Gentlewoman of <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> of an Ulcer in her womb, to whom he gave every fourth day, five ounces of the Decoction of Senna, Epithimum, red Roſes, and Indian Myrobalans ſweetened with Sugar, uſing to caſt clenſing Decoctions, as Injections into her womb.</p>
                     <p>For to be ever in a readineſs, This following Magiſterial Syrup may be compounded.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of the greater Comfry Roots, and new Polypody of the Oak, of each one ounce: Citron peels dried, ſix drams: Leaves of Plantane,</hi> Vinca pervinca, <hi>Ladies mantle, Sorrel, Maiden-hair, of each a handful: Liquoris ſcraped and ſplit, and Raiſons ſtoned, of each one ounce: Senna clenſed ſix ounces: Carthamus ſeeds bruiſed two ounces: Agarick newly made into Cakes and bound in a Cloth, ten drams: Musk-melone ſeeds, and Annis ſeeds, of each three drams: the Cordial Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Roſemary Flowers, and Epithimum, of each one pugil. Make of all a Decoction in Barley Water, in part whereof infuſe of choyce Rhubarb half an ounce: Cinnamon one dram. In a pint and half of the ſtrained Liquor, diſſolve three ounces of the Syrup of Damask Roſes, and as much Sugar as ſhall be requiſite to make it into a Syrup perfectly boyled. Of this let her take two or three ounces, twice or thrice in a month with ſome Decoction of Agrimony and Plantane, or the Infuſion of Rhubarb in Endive Water.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the Patient be eaſie to vomit, a purge upwards by Vomit, is to be preferred before the other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it draws back the Humors from the womb.</p>
                     <p>In the ſpaces between purging, a Vulnerary Decoction is long to be uſed, which may be made af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Leaves of Agrimony, Burnet, Knotgraſs, Plantane, of each half a handful: China Roots three drams: Coriander ſeeds one dram: Currence half a dram: red Sanders one ſcruple. Boyl all in the Broth of a Chicken. Let the Patient take of the ſtrained Liquor morning and evening<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="488" facs="tcp:49088:214"/>Take <hi>Leaves of Mugwort, Plantane, Yarrow, of each one handful: Rhaponticum half an ounce: Agnus Caſtus ſeed one dram. Boyl all in a ſufficient quantity of white Wine. Sweeten the ſtrained Liquor with Sugar; and give her two or three ounces in a morning,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If a Feaver urge, and great quantity of bloodyiſh Quittor be voided, Whey and Milk will be very good; let her take eight ounces or more in a morning, adding a little Honey of Roſes, or Sugar.</p>
                     <p>If her fleſh begin to fall a way, with tokens of an Hectick Feaver, Milk, eſpecially Aſſes Milk, muſt be given with Sugar of Roſes for a whol month.</p>
                     <p>Sweat-provoking Medicines may likewiſe do good where there is no Inflamation, nor hot diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, to dry the Ulcer, and to revel the ſerous humors towards the habit of the Body.</p>
                     <p>Turpentine waſhed in ſome convenient water for the womb, as of Mugwort or Feaverfew; or in ſome water reſpecting the Ulcer, as of Plantane, and red Roſes, taken now and then with Sugar of Roſes, doth clenſe and conſolidate or fil up the Ulcer.</p>
                     <p>Pils of Bdellium given to a dram at a time, or every day, or once in two daies one ſcruple, do very much good, and ſtop the blood in caſe it flow.</p>
                     <p>Or new Pills may be made on purpoſe, to be uſed after the ſame manner, thus:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Bdellium three drams: Mirrh, Frankinſence, of each one dram: Sarcocella, Storax, Amber, Cheb-Myrobalans, of each half a dram: red Coral two ſcruples. With Syrup of Poppies make a Maſs fit for Pills, whereunto, in caſe of extream pain, a little Opium may be added.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Trochiſci Alkekengi</hi> [Cakes compounded with Winter-Cherries, of which conſult my <hi>London Diſpenſatory</hi>] with Opium, are likewiſe (being poudered) given to drink down, where the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is troubled with great pain.</p>
                     <p>Alſo to mitigate pain, the ſame Remedies may be uſed, which we preſcribed for that intent, in our diſcourſe of the Inflamation of the womb.</p>
                     <p>This following Pouder is very effectual to dry up the Ulcer:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Acacia, Juyce of Hypociſtis, of each one dram: Dragons blood, fine Starch, Plantane Roots, Birthwort, or round Ariſtolochia Roots, of each half a dram: Bole Armoniack one dram: Maſtich, Sarcocolla, of each half a dram. Make all into a moſt ſine Pouder, whoſe Doſe let be one dram, with Plantane water, red Roſe water, or water wherein Steel hath been often quenched.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Zacutus Luſitanus</hi> in the 87. Obſervation, and the 88. of his ſecond Book, propounds an Electua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and a Water, wherewith he witneſſeth that he had cured Ulcers of the womb judged incurable.</p>
                     <p>Any one may find the Deſcription of them in the places above cited.</p>
                     <p>To clenſe, dry, and fill up the Ulcer, divers ſorts of Injections are uſually made; which are never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, not to be uſed, until the Inflamation be firſt taken away, which is oftentimes attendant upon theſe kind of Ulcers; and until the pain be aſſwaged, which is not only very troubleſom, but alſo by vexing the part, it is wont to encreaſe the flux of Humors.</p>
                     <p>In regard therefore of that ſame Inflamation and ſharpneſs of Humors, let Emulſions of the cooling Seeds, VVhey of Goats Milk, or Milk it ſelf, either alone, or mingled with the Juyce of Plantane and Shepheards-purſe; or if need be, a Decoction of Poppy heads, and the tops of Mallows be firſt of al injected. Some Practitioners are of Opinion, that luke-warm water alone, doth very much good in theſe caſes, if it be often injected. And there is reaſon for it, ſeeing by that means the heat and Inflamation of the womb is tempered, the pain is aſſwaged, and the filth adhering to the Ulcer is waſhed off. <hi>Valeſcus de Taranta,</hi> doth approve of cold water likewiſe, in theſe words: <hi>I have known</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>ſome women, who perceiving they had <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers in their wombs, did waſh them with cold Water, and then wipe them clean, and dry them with linnen cloaths, which they did often pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap> in at the Watergate. And by theſe means often renewed, they came many times to be perfectly cured.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The hot diſtemper taken away, and the pain aſſwaged, or for the moſt part diminiſhed, we muſt proceed to Clenſers, firſt uſing the more light and eaſie Clenſers, and after the more ſtrong.</p>
                     <p>The gentle Clenſers are, VVhey taken with Sugar, Barley water ſweetened with Sugar, or Honey of Roſes, to make it more clenſing; or Hydromel ſimple (ſee my <hi>Diſpenſatory,</hi> a mixture of water and honey boyled a while together.)</p>
                     <p>For a more ſtrong Clenſer, uſe the Decoction of Barley, Lintels, ſhaled Beans, and the Leaves of Smallage, Pellitory of the wal, Plantane, boyled together, a little Honey of Roſes being added to the ſtraining.</p>
                     <p>VVhen the Ulcer is very foul, the wound-decoction commonly called <hi>Aqua Catapultarum,</hi> is the beſt thing that can be uſed, whoſe Compoſition is thus:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>the Roots of Gentian, Rhapontick: Zedoary, and round Ariſtolochia or Birthwort, of each one ounce: white Wine ſix pints: boyl all till a third part of the Liquor be conſumed. In the
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:49088:214"/>
ſtraining diſſolve half a pound of white Sugar. Let it be kept for uſe as occaſion requires.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or the following Decoction may be provided:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of whol Barley, courſe Bran, and red Roſes, of each one pugil: Leaves of Agrimony, Wormwood, Woodbind, and Smallage, of each one handful: Beans and Lentils, of each three drams: ſcraped Liquoris, Orice Roots of Florence, and Zedoary, of each two ounces. Boyl all in water, adding towards the end, a little white Wine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the Ulcers be very ſtinking and ful of rotten Quittor, there may be added to the Decoction, a little <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum Aegyptiacum, Collyrium Lanfranci,</hi> or the Pouder of dulcified Mercury.</p>
                     <p>When the Ulcer ſhal be wel ſcoured and clenſed, we muſt uſe drying and ſolidating things, made af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>the greater Comfry Roots, Biſtort Roots, of each one ounce: Leaves of Plantane, Horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail, Shepheards-purſe, Ladies Mantle, Mouſ-ear, Yarrow, of each one handful: red Roſe Leavs half a handful: Boyl all in water, and make thereof an Injection.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>With the which or like Injection, this following fleſh-creating Pouder may be mingled.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>the Roots of Orice, Birthwort, great Comfry, of each half an ounce: Mirrh one ounce: Aloes three drams. Make all into Pouder, of which half an ounce may be mingled with every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Turpentine waſh'd in Plantane Water to the quantity of two drams, diſſolved with Honey and the Yolk of an Egg, wil do very much good, mingled with the Injection; and the more if the fleſh-creating Pouder be alſo added.</p>
                     <p>The Oyntment <hi>Pompholygos, de Ceruſa, de Plumbo,</hi> of each ſix drams for a Doſe, mixed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, are likewiſe uſed in Injections. But the Egg-yolk Oyl, rubbed about with a Peſtle in a Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Morter, is better than al the reſt.</p>
                     <p>Fumes received through a cloſe ſtool, do pierce to the deep Ulcers which are about the bottom of the Womb, and dry them: Which may be thus prepared:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Frankinſence, Mirrh, Maſtich, Storax, Juniper, Gum, Labdanum, of each one ounce: Turpentine as much as ſhall be requiſite. Make all into little Cakes for to be burnt under a cloſe ſtool.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In a moſt ſtubborn Ulcer, Cinnabarus or Minium being added to the Fume-Cakes, bears away the Bell from al other Medicaments.</p>
                     <p>Alſo Baths that are drying, Sulphurous, and Allumiſh, are uſed in long Ulcers: and Phyſitians are wont to ſend their deſperate Patients to thoſe Baths, as the laſt Remedy.</p>
                     <p>It wil not likewiſe be unprofitable to apply convenient Plaiſters to the Region of the Womb, ſeeing their vertue can paſs to the innermoſt parts of the womb, by the inviſible pores of the Body.</p>
                     <p>If an Ulcer be in the neck of the womb, it muſt be ſmeared with ſcouring and drying Liniments, or Oyntments. The Scourers may be made after this manner:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of the Juyce of Smallage two ounces: Honey of Roſes one ounce and an half: Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine half an ounce: Barley Meal as much as ſhall ſeem convenient. Boyl them all gently, and make them into the form of a Liniment or Oyntment.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>the round Birthwort half an ounce: Horehound, Centaury the ſmaller, Agrimony, of each half a handful. Boyl them in a ſit quantity of Hydromel. To the ſtrained Liquor add the pouder Florentine Orice Root two drams: Barley meal, and clarified Honey, of each as much as ſhall ſuffice. Make all into a Liniment or Oyntment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And ſomtimes the Oyntment <hi>Pompholygos</hi> is uſed, adding thereto, Frankinſence, Maſtich, Mirrh, Aloes, as the Nature of the Ulcer ſhal require.</p>
                     <p>When the Ulcer is ſufficiently clenſed, a drying and ſcar-contracting Oyntment is to be laid on, which may be thus made:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Tutty Pouder waſhed half an ounce: Litharge of Gold and Silver, Ceruſs, Sareocolla, of each two drams: Oyl and Wax as much as will ſuffice. Make all into an Oyntment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It falls out ſomtimes, That Ulcers of the Womb do penetrate unto the ſtreight Gut, and ſomtimes unto the Bladder; which is known by the Quittor iſſuing through the Water-Gate, or the Dung-Gate.</p>
                     <p>If the Quittor or Matter come out by ſtool, Lenitive, Scouring, and Drying Clyſters are to be uſed; ſuch as we propounded in our Cure of the Bloody-flux.</p>
                     <p>But if the Quittor come away by Urine, gentle Piſs-drivers and cooling wil be requiſite, which may purge out the filth ſent into the Bladder, and further the Cure of the Ulcer; ſuch as are, Emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the greater cold Seeds, after which, Turpentine muſt be uſed, and other Medicines preſcribed for an Ulcer of the Bladder.</p>
                     <p>If the Ulcer degenerate into a Fiſtula, which chieſly fals out when it opens outwardly towards the Hip, though it may likewiſe happen in the Womb it ſelf, and its Neck; it is to be conſidered, which
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:49088:215"/>
is better for the Patient, to leave that Paſſage free and open, to which Nature hath been accuſtomed, and by which ſhe endeavors to disburden her ſelf of manifold Excrements, or to ſtop the ſame. If it be judged beſt to keep it open, a palliative Cure muſt at leaſt be made, by Purges frequently repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and Sweat-provokers are to be adminiſtred twice in a yeer,; alſo ſcouring Injections, and ſtrengthening muſt be uſed, and <hi>Emplaſtrum D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>uch like Plaiſters, are to be laid upon it. But if there be hopes to make a perfect Cure, and heal up the Fiſtula, ſuch Medicines muſt be applied, as are wont to be uſed for the cure of other Fiſtulaes.</p>
                     <p>If Ulcers happen in the Water-Gate, or in the Cavity of the Womb, by reaſon of the Lechers Pox, they cannot be Cured without the General Cure of the ſaid Pox. In the performance of which Cure, of many waies, there is none better than Fumigations of Cinnabaris or Minium; for they do not only help to rid the whol Body of that Infection, but being received into the Cavity of the Womb, they do in a peculiar manner haſten the Cure of theſe kind of Ulcers. Likewiſe in the Cure of this Diſeaſe, by Quick-ſilver'd Oyntments, the ſaid Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments muſt be conveighed into the inner parts of the Womb.</p>
                     <p>In whatſoever Ulcers of the Womb, if the Neck thereof be moleſted with an itch, as it often falls out, by reaſon of a deflux of a ſharp and ſalt Humor into that part; to pacifie the ſaid Itch, a Peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary wil be good, dipped in <hi>

                        <hi>Chap. 9.</hi> Of a <hi>Scirrhus,</hi> or a Painleſs hard Swelling of the Womb.</head>
                     <p>THe Nature, Sorts, and Cauſes of a Scirrhus, or hard Swelling in the Womb, are the ſame which have been ſet down in our Chapter of the like Swelling in the Liver, and need not in this place be vainly repeated, but muſt be ſought for in the ſaid Chapter.</p>
                     <p>Howbeit among the Antecedent Cauſes, this is proper to an Hard-Swelling of the Womb, and is very frequent, namely, for women when the flux of their Courſes or Child-bed purgations are upon them, undiſcreetly to expoſe themſelves to the cold Air, or to drink cold water; whereby the flux is ſtayed, and the retained blood grows thick, and is condenſed, and at length produceth a Scirrhus or ſtony hard Swelling in the Womb.</p>
                     <p>The Signs of ſuch a Swelling bred in the Womb, are, An hardneſs ſelt in the Region of the Womb, ſuch as reſiſts the touch, which hardneſs repreſents the compaſs of the Womb; an heavineſs in the ſame place, and a ſence of ſome weight bearing down, eſpecially when the ſick woman ſtands, as though the womb would fal down into the water-Gate; but when they ſit or lie, it bears upon the ſtreight Gut with its weight. There is no Feaver nor pain; wherein it differs from an Inflamation, or at moſt there is but very little pain in an imperfect Scirrhus, but in the Womb there is none. If it follow an Inflamation the Feaver and pain ceaſes, the hardneſs and reſiſtence abiding. If it be in the Body of the Womb, it is eaſily diſcerned by handling the parts about the Share; but if it be in the Neck of the womb, it may be perceived by ones finger. It is diſtinguiſhed from a Mole by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Cauſes; and becauſe in a Mole, if the Courſes flow, they flow diſorderly, but in this Hard Swelling they keep their order; and in a Mole, the womans Dugs ſtrout with Milk, but in the Hard Swelling they are extenuated.</p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſtick Signs, Every Scirrhus or hard ſtony Swelling, is very exceeding hard to cure; for an extream Hardneſs once contracted can hardly be ſoftened; alſo Natural heat is ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry weak in that part where there is ſuch a Swelling, that it can very hardly diſcuſs an hard and almoſt ſtony ſubſtance.</p>
                     <p>A great and unvanquiſhable Scirrhus, or ſtony Swelling, doth at length bring the Dropſie to keep him company.</p>
                     <p>A Scirrhus, or ſtony hard Swelling of the womb, if it be tampered withal with over hot and moiſt Medicaments, it turns into a Cancer.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of this Diſeaſe aims at two things, the Antecedent Cauſe, and the conjoyned or conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant Cauſe.</p>
                     <p>In reſpect of the Antecedent Cauſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Vein muſt be opened, firſt in the Arms, if the Diſeaſe be of no very long continuance; afterward in the lower parts, eſpecially when the Patients Courſes are ſtopt.</p>
                     <p>The opening of the Hemorrhoid Veins, is alſo very profitable in this caſe: For they do both eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate dreggy blood, and they turn the Humor from the womb, becauſe of the communion which the Veins have with the womb.</p>
                     <p>Purging is likewiſe neceſſary, by fits repeated, procured by ſuch Medicines as purge Melancholly,
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:49088:215"/>
uſing firſt the gentler, and then the ſtronger ſort by degrees.</p>
                     <p>And before the Purges, ſuch things muſt be given as prepare the Melancholly Humor, and open the narrow paſſages of the Excrements, in the form of Apozems, Juleps, or Broths, according to the diſpoſition of the ſick party.</p>
                     <p>And beſides the ordinary Openers, Medicines with Steel, muſt be likewiſe uſed, whereby thoſe ſtrongeſt Obſtructions cauſed by thick and rebellious Humors in the Womb and other parts, may be diſſolved.</p>
                     <p>And that ſuperfluous humors may be derived from the womb, Iſſues may profitably be made in the Thighs, which are to be kept open until the Patients monthly Courſes (which are commonly ſtopt in this Diſeaſe) ſhal return unto their ordinary form, in reſpect of time, quantity, and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
                     <p>In reſpect of the conjoyned Cauſe, Emollient and Reſolving Medicaments are to be applied out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, compounded after this manner:</p>

                     <p>For the greater mollifying, the Decoction may be made in Water and ſweet Oyl, or in the Broth made of a Wethers Guts.</p>
                     <p>There may alſo be added to the Decoction, that it may become more powerful, the Roots of Brio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and wild Cucumers; for we muſt begin with the milder, and proceed to the ſtronger by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</p>
                     <p>Of the ſame Decoction (augmenting the quantity of the Simples) may a Bath be made for the Patient to ſit in, which is very effectual in this Caſe, and more powerful than a Fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>

                        <hi>Chap. 10.</hi> Of a Cancer of the Womb.</head>
                     <p>A Cancer is a hard Swelling of the Body or Neck of the Womb, which reſiſts the touch, and cauſeth a moſt vehement pain, as it were pricking and cutting the part affected.</p>
                     <p>It is cauſed by black Choller gathered in that part, or by reaſon of a Scirrhus, or ſenceleſs hard tumor il cured, which eaſily turns into a Cancer, eſpecially in this part of the Body, by reaſon of the copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous afflux of blood, which being retained in thoſe Veins which are nigh unto the Scirrhus, and not ſufficiently evacuated by the monthly purgations, it becomes aduſt or burned, and acquires a malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant diſpoſition.</p>
                     <p>It is ordinarily reckoned to be of two ſorts, Ulcerate, and not Ulcerate.</p>
                     <p>So long as the Morbifick matter is of leſſer Acrimony and Malignity, it cauſeth a Cancer not ulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but when it grows more ſharp by putrefaction or aduſtion, it doth exulcerate the tumor, and produce an ulcerated Cancer.</p>
                     <p>The Diſeaſe may eaſily be known by the definition propounded; for if an hard Tumor reſiſting the touch, be felt in the Body of the Womb, or its Neck, cauſing a pricking and cutting pain, we may pronounce boldly that it is a Cancer, Yet it is more evidently diſtinguiſhed by the eye-ſight, when it may be ſeen as in the Neck of the Womb it may be, with help of a Womb-perſpective Inſtrument; for we ſhal ſee an uneven and bunching ſwelling, Lead-colored or black, compaſſed about with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain branches of Veins, as it were with roots; but if it be ulcerated, it ſends forth a certain blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watry quittor or matter, which is yellow or black, and ſtinking, and ſomtimes blood, by corroſion of the Veins which paſs through that part, ſomtimes in ſuch quantity that the Patient incurs danger of death. Hereunto is added a ſmal Feaver, unquietneſs, Stomach-ſickneſs, an heat in, and about the Water-Gate, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>By way of Prognoſtication, we can only ſay thus much, That a Cancer is incurable, be it ulcera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or not ulcerated. Which as it is true of al Cancers, not excepting thoſe in the outer parts of the Body, much more is it of a Cancer in the Womb, by reaſon of that perpetual Common-ſhore of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements which flows into the part.</p>
                     <p>Seeing then a perfect Cure cannot be hoped for, we muſt content our ſelves with ſuch a Cure as is called <hi>Palliative.</hi> The ſcope whereof is, to hinder a not ulcerated Cancer from ulcerating, and an exulcerated Cancer from becoming more exulcerate: and in both to allay and temper the extremity of the pain. Which muſt be done, firſt by univerſal Purgations of the whol Body, and by other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines which may qualifie and evacuate the black Chollerick, and Melanchollick blood, and hinder the further generation thereof. In the number of which are, bleeding in the Arm, Anckle, and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhoid Veins; Potions, Apozems, Juleps, Broths, Milk, Whey, cold Mineral Waters, and ſuch like Remedies as theſe uſually preſcribed by Practitioners for the Cure of al Cancers in what part of the Body ſoever. And eſpecially Purgations muſt be frequently reiterated, that the antecedent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a Cancer may be abated.</p>
                     <p>And then outward Remedies are to be uſed, ſuch as are moderately cool and aſtringent, without any corroſive or biting quality; they are commonly applied in form of Liniments or Oyntments. The beſt are made after this manner:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Oyl of Myrtles and Roſes, of each two ounces: Juyce of Nightſhade and Houſleek, of each one ounce. Stir all together in a Leaden Morter, with a Leaden Peſtle, until they grow black: then add Litharge of Silver, and Ceruſs, both waſhed in Scabious Water, of each two drams: Camphire ten grains. Make all into an Oyntment, with which let the part affected, be ſmeared three or four times a day.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Oyl of Egg-yolks, and of Roſes, of each one ounce and an half: Sugar of Lead one dram. Stir them together in a Leaden morter till their color change.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This following puts down al the reſt, wherewith Swellings of the Dugs which have been accounted Cancerous, have been perfectly cured.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Egg-yolks Oyl two ounces: Juyce of Nightſhade and Veronica or Houſleek, of each half an ounce: Quick-ſilver not killed two drams. Stir them luſtily together in a leaden morter, with a leaden peſtle, till they become thick as an Oyntment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The foreſaid Oyntments are to be conveyed into the womb upon long tents, or upon wax Candles, wound in Linnen. But Injections may much more eaſily be conveyed into the Womb. They are compounded on this manner:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Barley Water half a pint: Nightſhade and Plantane Water, of each two ounces: Water of Houſleek one ounce: white Troches of</hi> Rhaſis <hi>two drams: Sugar of Lead one dram. Make of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>
                        <pb n="493" facs="tcp:49088:216"/>Alſo let the part affected be fomented with the waters of Plantane and Nightſhade, or their Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; whereunto may be added the Leaves of Water-lilly, white Poppy, red Roſes, and Camphire. Which Decoction may alſo frequently be injected into the womb, and it wil become much more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, if it ſhal be wel wrought about in a Leaden morter, or a dram of the Sugar of Lead be added to it.</p>
                     <p>Among Specifick Remedies, Frogs are commended, being waſhed and boyled, and laid on as a Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſs, or their Broth being uſed as an Injection. Alſo the Decoction, or juyce of River Crabs, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted into the womb. As alſo Herb Robert uſed inwardly or outwardly.</p>
                     <p>If the Cancer be ulcerated, the Doſe of Minerals muſt be augmented in the foreſaid Liniments, and to them the aſhes of River Crabs may profitably be added. And with the Injections, the white Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Rhaſis</hi> may be mingled, and Barley Water with the Materials of the foreſaid Injection.</p>
                     <p>If pain be very urgent, Fomentations of Mallows, Marſh-mallows, Water-Lillies, Poppy, Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane, Green Coriander, Dil, Fleawort ſeeds, Milk, Saffron, and the like, are to be uſed at convenient ſeaſons; or Pultiſſes made of them are to be applied. And of their Decoctions, Injections, and Baths to ſit in, may be provided.</p>
                     <p>Yet wil not al theſe Medicaments ſomtimes ſerve turn to pacifie a moſt cruel pain, which ſomtimes gives the Patient neither reſt nor ſleep. Which compels us many times to make uſe of Narcotick or ſtupefactive Medicines, which in this Diſeaſe, by reaſon of the exceeding Heat of the Humors, do leſs hurt. And I have ſeen a woman, having a Cancer in her Dug, that took every night for four months together, two or three grains of Laudanum, and had no hurt, but very great comfort there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>
                     <p>If from an ulcerated Cancer much blood do proceed, as it often fals out, let Juyce of Plantane with a little Frankinſence be injected into the womb.</p>

                     <p>A Gangrene is the corruption or mortification of a part beginning; but when it is wholly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and dead, it is ſaid to be Sphacelated, or blaſted.</p>
                     <p>In the Genital parts of Women, this Diſeaſe is eaſily bred, becauſe thoſe parts are moiſter and ſofter than ordinary, and do eaſily receive the Excrements of the whol Body.</p>
                     <p>It often follows an Inflamation, Impoſthume, Ulcer, or Cancer il cured, when the vital heat of the part, is choaked or deſtroyed. It is choaked in great Inflamations, when more blood flows in than the Natural heat of the part can digeſt, or turn into Matter. It is deſtroyed, either by a cold di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper extinguiſhing it, or by an hot one, diſſipating and reſolving the ſame.</p>
                     <p>A beginning Gangrene is known by an unuſual heat felt in the part, a horror and trembling ſeizes upon the Patient, with a languiſhing and quick-beating pulſe, and with fainting away, or ſwooning. And ſeeing this Diſeaſe doth for the moſt part happen to the Neck of the Womb, ſo that the part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected may be perceived by the Eye; it is diſcovered to be ſoft, Lead-colored, black and carrion like, and may be prickt or cut, and the Patient never feel it; and it ſends forth beſides, a ſtinking and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion-like ſmel.</p>

It is a moſt grievous, moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Diſeaſe, and for the moſt part deadly: yet it hath been obſerved by very many Authors, That the Womb being putrefied and Gangrenated, hath either fallen away of it ſelf, or been cut away, the womens lives being ſaved: which Obſervations of Authors, <hi>Schenkius</hi> hath collected to a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, in the fourth Book of his Obſervations.</p>
                     <p>The Cure is performed with the ſame Remedies which are wont to be applied to other parts being Gangrenated, if it be in the Neck of the Womb, or tend toward the outward parts; as namely, with Scarrifications, and waſhings or bathings with a Decoction of Wormwood, Mirrh, and ſuch like, with the Oyntment called <hi>Aegyptiacum,</hi> the Cataplaſm called <hi>De Tribus farmis,</hi> which is thus made:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Barley meal, Bean meal, and Orobus meal, of each two ounces: Oxymel one pound: Boyl them to the thickneſs of a Pultiſs or Cataplaſm. Whereunto if there be added, meal of Lupines, Mirrh, Aloes, and Wormwood, it will be more effectual.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If any part of the Womb be wholly corrupt and dead, it muſt be cut off; or if the Womb fall down, it muſt be ſeparated, by binding the Ligature every day faſter and cloſer. Of which kind of Operations, there be many Examples collected by <hi>Schenkius</hi> in the fourth Book of his Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Wierus</hi> alſo relates in his Obſervations, That he cured a woman of twenty five yeers of age, who
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:49088:217"/>
in the hotteſt of the Dog-daies, had a certain little bunch growing in her Water-Gate. Whereunto an unskilful Chyrurgion applying Pultiſſes that were not proper, within a few daies, all that part began to putrefie, grow black and dead, and the Diſeaſe paſt on with incredible ſwiftneſs towards the Dung-Gate. And <hi>Wierus</hi> undertook the Cure after this Method: Firſt, he ſquirted good ſtore of the Juyce of Nightſhade and Plantane with a Syringe into both the Paſſages three or four times a day; between which times, he applyed a bolſter wet with the foreſaid Juyces, Vinegar being mixed therewith; which growing dry was wet again with the ſame Liquor. And in this courſe of reiterated Application he continued til the fervent heat was quenched, and the putrefaction began to ceaſe. She took in the mean while, thrice every day a Potion, of the Decoction of Sorrel, Scabious, Burnet, Damask Prunes, the tops of Borrage and Bugloſs, Marigold flowers, with Water, Sugar, and Vinegar, made in the manner of a long, acid, or ſharp Syrup. Her Diet was ſpare, but cooling and tart, to prevent putrefaction. On the third day, the fury of the burning heat, and of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction, was abated. Whereupon he commanded the black and dead fleſh to be drawn or plucked out with a little Forceps [Chyrurgions Inſtrument, like Tongs or Pincers] and ſeparated round about from the live fleſh, without any pain, and ſo to be cut off. Then he conſumed the reliques e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the live fleſh with the Oyntment called <hi>Aegyptiacum.</hi> And proceeded to cicatrize, or bring it to a Scar, after the ſame manner which is uſed in other Ulcers.</p>
                     <p>In the whol courſe of the Cure, care muſt be had to ſtrengthen the Heart, both by things given in, and applied outwardly: Likewiſe Emollient, Clenſing, and Refrigerating Clyſters, are frequently to be given, which do much help the part affected, by reaſon of Neighbor-hood.</p>

                     <head>
                        <hi>Chap. 12.</hi> Of the Wombs Wind-and-Water Swelling, or Dropſie.</head>
                     <p>THe Inflation or blowing up of the Womb with Wind, and its Dropſie, are by Writers confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or jumbled together; ſo that they call the Inflation, a Dropſie coming of wind; whereas the Dropſie properly ſo called is ingendered by a watery Humor, Yet are they diſtinguiſhed, and there is a certain puffing up of the Womb with wind, ſuddenly ruſhing in, and ſtretching the ſame, and cauſing vehement pain, as in the Chollick; which becauſe it continues not, but is ſoon diſcuſſed, it deſerves not the name of a Dropſie; and ſuch a puffing up is often ſeen in Hyſterical women which have the Womb-fits.</p>
                     <p>There is therefore to be reckoned a two-fold Dropſie of the Womb; one from Wind, which is like that ſort of Belly-dropſie which is termed <hi>Tympanitis,</hi> or the Drum-belly Dropſie: another a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from a wheyiſh Humor, anſwering to the Dropſie of the Belly, called <hi>Aſcites,</hi> that is, the Bottle-belly Dropſie: Some add a third ſort, anſwering to the third ſort of Belly-Dropſies, called from its cauſe, <hi>Leucophlegmatia,</hi> that is, white-flegm Dropſie, which is ſeldom ſeen in the courſe of Practice. Yet I have ſeen a Gentlewoman, which in one day voided ſuch plenty of thick flegm out of her womb, as might weigh probably ſix or ſeven pound weight: which flegm long retained, might doubtleſs have cauſed in her, a Dropſie of the womb.</p>
                     <p>Wind and water cauſing a Dropſie of the Womb, are contained either within the Cavity of the Womb, or in its Membranes, or in certain Bladders. Touching the Cavity of the VVomb, it is ſomwhat doubted how Wind and Humors can be contained therein, ſeeing there is ſo eaſie a Paſſage through the Neck and Mouth of the VVomb. We anſwer, The inner Orifice or Mouth of the VVomb, may be cloſed up divers waies; either by thick flegm ſticking faſt thereunto, and growing hard, or by a Scirrhus, or ſome other cauſe. <hi>Mercatus</hi> conceives, That a ſnotty kind of flegm is voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the mouthes of thoſe Veins which are ordained for the monthly Purgations, and that of the ſaid ſnotty flegm a skin is framed, which covers all the inner ſurface of the VVomb, within which thin skin, the wheyiſh and windy Matter is contained. But <hi>Fernelius</hi> thinks, That water may be contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the womb, without any thing amiſs in its mouth, but barely by its conſtriction or purſing of it ſelf together. All theſe ſorts are to be allowed of, and may be confirmed by divers Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</p>
                     <p>And firſt of all, Examples of VVinds contained in the VVomb-Cavity, are recited by <hi>Sennertus,</hi> in the Fourth Book of his Practice, Part 1. Sect. 2. Chap. 10. The firſt is taken out of <hi>Valeſcus de Taranta,</hi> touching a certain Jewiſh woman of <hi>Liſbon,</hi> who taking her ſelf to be with Child, when ſhe expected to be delivered, a great quantity of wind came away, and ſo her womb was brought down again. The Second is taken out of <hi>Mathiolus de Gradi,</hi> who relates the ſame thing to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen his own wife. And other Examples taken out of <hi>Dodonaeus, Thadaeus Dunus,</hi> and other VVriters, do teſtifie the like Caſes; and we ſee the ſame often in the courſe of our Practice. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto may be added a Hiſtory, which we ſhall in the Cure relate out of <hi>Solenander,</hi> of a woman who
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:49088:217"/>
by means of a Fumigation made of Nutmegs, let wind fly out of her Womb, which gave a report like a Piſtol.</p>
                     <p>And Examples of Water contained in the Womb are propounded by the ſaid <hi>Sennertus,</hi> out of <hi>Rhaſis,</hi> who ſaw a woman out of whoſe Womb there flowed twenty five <hi>Cotila's</hi> of water, which is a Meaſure not uſed with us, containing about half an Ale Pint. Alſo out of <hi>Jacobus de Partibus,</hi> and <hi>Dodonaeus,</hi> who relate ſuch a like Story. And <hi>Veſalius</hi> Diſſected or Anatomized a woman, in the hollowneſs of whoſe womb, were found above ſixty <hi>Auſburg</hi> Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of water, each Meaſure containing three pints, and the mouth of her womb was grown to a wonderful hardneſs.</p>
                     <p>And that water is ſomtimes contained in the womb in bladders, many Authors do teſtifie, who have ſeen examples thereof in ſome women, who voided ſuch bladders ful of water from their wombs; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt <hi>Aetius, Valeriola, Chriſtopherus a Vega, Mercatus, Platerus,</hi> and <hi>Fabricius Hildanus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Somtimes alſo women with Child have a Dropſie at the ſame time in their wombs, as <hi>Fabricius Hildanus</hi> relates of his own wife, whoſe Belly was ſwelled to a monſtrous greatneſs; and at the time of her delivery, ſhe voided firſt of all, eighteen pints of water, and half an hour after, nine pints more; and at laſt ſhe was delivered of a Boy, ſtrong and healthy. The like caſe we find in <hi>Skenkius,</hi> but with a contrary event, concerning a woman, who being delivered of a living Child, continued ſtil big-bellied, and her belly growing ſtil greater and greater, ſhe died of it, and her womb being opened, a great quantity of water was found therein.</p>
                     <p>Finally, <hi>Fernelius</hi> hath an Example, in the ſixth Book of Diſeaſes, Chap. 15. of water retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the womb, only by reaſon of the cloſe ſhutting of the mouth of the womb, without any other fault therein. The ſtory is of a woman that had a Dropſie in her womb, who as often as ſhe had her monthly Purgations, voided al her watry Excrements out of her womb, filling ſix or eight Baſons with a very hot yellowiſh water, til the ſwelling of her belly was wholly abated. The next month the like redundancy of watry Excrements being collected, was in like manner evacuated.</p>
                     <p>The immediate Cauſe of the windy and watry Swelling of the womb, is the weakneſs of Natural heat, reſiding in the Liver or Spleen; and from thoſe parts, wind, flegm, or wheyiſh humors are tranſmitted into the womb; or the weakneſs is in the womb it ſelf, whereby the ſaid Excrements are therein collected and heaped together.</p>
                     <p>And the Cauſes which weaken Natural heat, either directly, or by accident, are very many, and the chief are, of thoſe things which are collected by Phyſitians, <hi>Res non Naturales,</hi> things not Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural. So, cold air, eſpecially after Child-birth, heedleſsly received into the womb, is a moſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual cauſe of this infirmity. Alſo cold Air unſeaſonably received when the Courſes flow, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing frequently into cold water, or padling in the ſame, eſpecially during the ſaid flux, is a cauſe thereof. So is much uſe of cold Meats, or windy, as fruits, Herbs, Beans, and Peaſe, and likewiſe of Vinegar: Cold water plentifully and unſeaſonably drunk down, long and deep ſleep, painful chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and abortion eſpecially if it often happen, immoderate flux of the Courſes, exhauſting the Natural heat, or their ſuppreſſion choaking the ſame. Add to theſe, the proper Diſeaſes of the womb, as ſwellings, ulcers, and ſuch like, which do reſolve the heat of the part; or elſe ſhut the mouth of the womb, and hinder the egreſs of Menſtrual blood, and excrementitious humors.</p>
                     <p>In the Diſcovery of this Diſeaſe, many things are to be conſidered:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, How this particular Dropſie of the womb, may be known and diſtinguiſhed from that of the whol Body?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, How the ſeveral ſorts of this Womb-Dropſie may be diſcerned, as whether it come from wind, from wheyiſh Humors, or from flegm?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Whether it proceed primarily from ſome infirmity of the womb, or by fault of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of the Body?</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Whether the Matter offending be contained in the Cavity of the womb, or between its Membranes, or in certain Bladders?</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, How to diſtinguiſh it from other Tumors of the womb?</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, How from being great with Child?</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, How it may be known from a Mole?</p>
                     <p>As for the Firſt Queſtion. It is diſtinguiſhed from an Univerſal Dropſie of the Belly, in that the Womb-Dropſie ſwels chiefly the lower part of the Belly; whereas the univerſal Dropſie diſtends equally the whol Belly in all the parts thereof. Again, In the Womb-Dropſie, paleneſs and falling away of the fleſh of the whol body, are not ſo ſoon diſcerned as in the univerſal Dropſie, in which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for the moſt part, there is evident thirſt and drineſs of the tongue, which are not found in the womb-Dropſie, in which al other Symptomes are likewiſe far more gentle, than is uſual in the univerſal Dropſie. In a word, In the Womb-dropſie, ſome wind breaks out of the womb by fits; or a little water comes away, which evidently declare, that wind or water are contained in the womb.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="496" facs="tcp:49088:218"/>To the ſecond Queſtion we Anſwer thus. That the ſorts of Womb-Dropſies may be known from one another after this manner. If it ariſe from wind, the lower part of the belly being ſtruck gives a ſound; the belly is afflicted with pricking paines, which reach ſomtimes as far as the Midrif, Stomach, Loyns, and other parts; ſomtimes wind breakes evidently out of the neck of the Womb. Likewiſe, women often feel their Wombs riſeing like a Globe towards their ſtomachs. Somtimes their breath is ſhort and the ſick woman when ſhe awakes out of ſleep, oftentimes is much troubled to fetch her wind. After all meat and drink whatever, they are worſe. They often belch, and their belchings give them eaſe. They are oft troubled with Womb fits or ſuffocation of the Mother. Somtimes they are pained below the navel, ſo as they cannot endure to be touched. Thoſe Signes do alſo appear in the Inflation or Blowing up of the Womb with wind, which differs from this Diſeaſe (as was ſaid before) only in this, that the Inflation is of leſs durance, but a Dropſie of wind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues a far longer time.</p>
                     <p>But if the Wombs Dropſie ariſe from a wheyiſh Humor, the Region thereof appeares ſoft and flaggy; whereas wind ſtretches it ſtif: there is a greater heavineſs in the part and a noyſe as of water flowing this way and that way: ſome water now and then drops from the Privity. And finally if it ariſe from flegm, the ſoftneſs and flaggineſs of the part will be yet greater, and encreaſe daily more and more; and the bordering parts, as all under the Navel, the Privy parts, the ſpace between the Privity &amp; Fundament; with the Loynes, will be ſeen to ſwell with a Phlematick kind of Swelling.</p>
                     <p>To the Third Queſtion we anſwer thus. If there be apparent tokens of the whol Bodies being miſaffected, as by acute or long feavers, immoderate fluxes of blood, grievous diſtillations from the Head, Weakneſſes of the ſtomach: ſwellings of the Spleen or Liver and other ſtubborn Diſeaſes of thoſe parts, with which the Wombes Dropſie began, encreaſing as they encreaſed; it will be more than an even lay, that the Womb receives the matter of it's Dropſie from thoſe parts by way of a flux of Rhewm. But if this Womb-ſwelling happen, when the whol Body is in good health, and do ſucceed particular diſeaſes of the Womb, ſuch as are hard Travels in Child-birth, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the monthly courſes, or over great flux thereof, Ulcers, Chollerick, or Melancholick, or hard Tumors, we may conjecture, that the Wombes-Dropſie doth depend upon thoſe particular diſpoſitions, and that the matter cauſing the ſaid Tumor, is gathered together in the Womb it ſelf, by means of its inability perfectly to digeſt and aſſimilate its nutriments.</p>
                     <p>To the fourth Queſtion, we may Anſwer by ſaying, That the Matter which is contained in the cavity of the Womb, doth make a much larger Swelling, than when it is contained in bladders. Again, when it proceeds from a wheyiſh humor, a greater fluctuation of the water is perceived than when it is contained in bladders. And if ſo be, little bladders full of water be voided out of the Womb, it's a moſt certaine ſign, that the Humour is contained in the little bladders.</p>
                     <p>To the firſt Queſtion we muſt Anſwer; that the Wombs-Dropſie is Differenced from Tumors of blood or Choller, ariſing in the Womb: becauſe in ſuch Tumors or Swellings there is a feaver and a pain which is encreaſed by the leaſt touch; alſo the Inflamation reaching even to the parts of Generation. And it is diſtinguiſhed from Scirrhous and Cancerous Swellings, becauſe in it there is no ſuch great Hardneſs, which can reſiſt the impreſſion of the Finger, but it rather gives way, and pitts.</p>
                     <p>To the Sixth Quaere wee ſay: When a woman is big with Child, the Swelling is not ſo even and depreſſed, but it is ſharp, buncheth out, and ſeems greater about the navel than elſwhere. Secondly, In Greatneſs with Child, after ſome months, women are for the moſt part ſomwhat better than they were, becauſe the Child grown big conſumes the greater part of thoſe humors, which in the firſt months were burdenſome: But the Dropſie, the further it proceeds the worſe it growes. Thirdly, In greatneſs with Child, the child is manifeſtly perceived. to ſtir, after the third or fourth month; which is not in the VVomb-Dropſie. Yet it falls out ſomtimes, that when the Dropſie is cauſed by wind, a certain Palpitation is preceived in the VVomb; but it is eaſily diſtinguiſhed from the moving of a Child, which is more even, and is wont to be perceived in divers parts of the Belly. Fourthly, In Greatneſs of Child, the womans Duggs ſwell; but in the Dropſie they are extenuated and become ſmaller.</p>
                     <p>To the ſeventh Quaere we Anſwer, that in a Mole, women find a kind of Heavineſs in their VVombs, which they feel not in the VVomb-Dropſie; and when they lie on the one of their ſides, they perceive the weight to roul like a ſtone to that ſide. Again, in the Mole, violent flux of Courſes comes by fits, namely, every third or fourth month; which happens not in the VVomb-Dropſie. Laſtly, in caſe of a Mole, the Duggs ſwell, and ſomtimes have milk; in the VVomb-Dropſie, quite Contrary.</p>
                     <p>As touching the Prognoſticks of this Diſeaſe. A ſimple Inflation or puffing up of the womb with wind, becauſe it laſts not, is without danger. Yet if not quickly cured it may grow to a true Dropſie.</p>
                     <p>A Womb-Dropſie cauſed by a good conditioned Humor void of putrefaction, is wont to proue a
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:49088:218"/>
long Diſeaſe; yet may it in proceſs of time be cured, yea ſomtimes, the water flows of its own accord out of the womb, and the Patient recovers her health.</p>
                     <p>But if the Humor be malignant, ſharp, or putrid, which is known by the grievous Symptomes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing; the Diſeaſe is dangerous, and for the moſt part deadly: For if the Diſeaſe depend upon ſome private Diſeaſe of the Womb, it betokens a perfect ruine of the natural Functions of that part; whence follows at laſt an univerſal Dropſie of the whol Body. But if the Womb ſuffer by conſent of other parts, viz. of the Liver, Spleen, or Stomach, the Miſchief wil be the greater, and ruine is thereby threatned to the whol Body. Hence it was well ſaid of <hi>Aetius,</hi> Such as is a womans womb, ſuch for the moſt part, is the reſt of her body.</p>
                     <p>If wind or water be contained in the Cavity of the womb, it is more eaſily cured than if it be ſhut within little skins or bladders.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of this Diſeaſe is performed almoſt by the ſame Remedies which have been propounded to cure the Dropſie and Green-ſickneſs. Whereunto ſome things more properly belonging to this diſeaſe muſt be added. And in the firſt place concerning Blood-letting; In the Diſeaſe, being new, proceeding from a ſuppreſſion of the Courſes and from ſome Plenitude ſtill appearing, blood-let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting may be convenient; otherwiſe it wil hurt, ſeeing natural heat is exceedingly weakened and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed; and ſtubborn Obſtructions cauſed by a cold Humor, do cauſe fear of an Univerſal Dropſie.</p>
                     <p>But Purging is altogether neceſſary, and muſt be often reiterated, as we ordered in the forenamed Diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>After ſufficient Purgation, Openers, Diureticks, and ſuch things as move the Courſes, are to be given, ſuch as are deſcribed in the places aforeſaid. Unto which, theſe following may be added.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Roots of Smallage, and of Madder, of each half an ounce: the Leaves of Savin, Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verfew, Penyroyal, of each one pugil: Carrots ſeeds one dram. Boyl all in the Broth of a yong Pidgeon, and let her drink the ſtrained Liquor divers daies together.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Before ſhe drink of the Broth, let her ſwallow one of the following Pills.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of the beſt Caſtoreum, Mirrh, Madder, of each half a dram: Saffron twenty grains. With Juyce of Lemmons make all into nine Pills.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After which Medicaments the Patient muſt exerciſe her ſelf ſtoutly, by which means, not only the Excrements bred in the Bowels, and the whol compaſs of the Body, may by aſſiſtance of Heat be diſſipated; but all which is contained in the womb, may be voided out, the bladders being broken by violence of the Exerciſe.</p>
                     <p>If the woman do eaſily vomit, ſomthing may be profitably given her twice in a week to that end; by which means, not only the Humors which were wont to flow unto the womb, will be recalled, and brought forth; but the foreſaid bladders ſticking in the womb, and ſomtime containing a watry Humor, happily may be broken by the vehement motion and agitation, whereupon the Humor of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending wil be voided.</p>
                     <p>To diſcuſs the ſaid Humor contained in the womb, the following Bolus, or Morſel, will be moſt effectual.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of Mineral Borax half a dram: Saffron twenty grains: With Juyce of Savin, make all into a Morſel. Let it be taken twice in a week.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sweat-drivers are likewiſe very profitable in this diſeaſe, for by them, wheyiſh and flegmatick hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, whether in the womb, or the whol body, are diſcuſſed and evacuated.</p>
                     <p>In the mean while, the inbred heat of the Stomach muſt be ſtrenthened both with things given in, and outwardly applied, deſcribed in the Cures of the diſeaſes of that Part.</p>
                     <p>And outwardly, Medicines muſt be applied to ſtrengthen the womb, and to diſcuſs the Humors contained therein.</p>
                     <p>And in the firſt place, Fomentations and Baths to ſit in, may be made of a Decoction of Briony roots, wild Cucumer, the leavs of Danewort or Dwarf-Elder, Mercury, Elder, Origanum, Calaminth, Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, Rue, Sage, Marjoram, Time, Bay, Penyroyal, Mugwort; Seeds of Broom, Carrots, Cummin, Annis, Fennel; Berries of the Bay and Juniper Tree; Flowers of Chamomel, Melilot, and Roſema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Of which, little bags may likewiſe be made, boyled in white Wine. Or the foreſaid Ingredients, or ſome of them, may be boyled in the Lye made of the aſhes of Vine-boughs.</p>
                     <p>And that the foreſaid Fomentations may work the better, they are to be applied before and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind: and the ſick woman ought to ſweat, if ſhe can, in her bed, or in a Stove conveniently prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Which likewiſe may be procured by help of a Bathing Tub.</p>
                     <p>In a windy Dropſie, dry Fomentations will be more profitable, with bags of Milet, Salt, Cummin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed, and Bran fryed in a pan and beſprinkled with Wine.</p>
                     <p>After Fomentation let her Belly from the Navel downward, be anointed with Nard Oyl, Oyl of Dill, Oyl of Rue, Wormwood, and Southernwood. Which Oyls, if drawn out by Chymical Art, they wil be much more effectual.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="498" facs="tcp:49088:219"/>After Unction, lay on a Plaiſter of Bay-berries, or a Pultiſs of Cows and Sheeps Dung, with Seeds of Smallage, Parſly, and Cummin, as alſo Honey boyled therewith.</p>
                     <p>To the ſame purpoſe the Skin of a Sheep newly killed is commended, ſprinkled with warm Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Sack, and laid warm upon the Belly.</p>
                     <p>Clyſters are frequently to be given, made of the Decoction of Wormwood, Origanum, Penyroyal, Rue, Centaury, and the like: Or of the Oyl of Rue, Nuts and Dill, with white Wine, Hypocras, or Muskadine. In which Clyſters diſſolve <hi>Benedicta Laxativa, Hiera Diacolocynthidos, Tere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binthinam,</hi> Confection of Bay-berries, Roſemary-flower Honey, and the like.</p>
                     <p>Injections into the womb may be very profitable to evacuate the Humors contained therein, being compounded after this manner:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Roots of Aſarabacca three drams: Leaves of Penyroyal, Calaminth, of each half a handful: Savin a pugil: Mecboacan a dram: Annis ſeed, Cummin ſeed, of each half a dram. Boyl all, and in ſix ounces of the ſtrained Liquor, diſſolve an ounce of Oyl of Orice, and as much of Elder Oyl, and make thereof an Injection.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To the ſame end may Peſſaries be made, thus:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Coloquintida and Mechoacan, of each one dram: Sal Nitre ten grains: boyled Honey as much as ſhall ſuffice. Make all into a Peſſary.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Bindweed Roots, Roots of Eſula, of each a dram: Seed of Gith, or Nigella Romana half a dram: Honey as much as ſhall ſuffice. Make all into a Peſſary.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Elaterium half a dram: bruiſed Figs as much as ſhall be requiſite. Make them into a Peſſary.</hi>

                     <p>When the Swelling of the womb proceeds from wind, a Fumigation of Nutmegs is very helpful, being commended by <hi>Solenander,</hi> in theſe words: <hi>A Woman newly out of Child-bed, expoſing her ſelf over ſoon to the wind and air, fell into inſufferable pains, neither could ſhe find any help. At laſt comes an old well experienced Midwife, and calls for three Nutmegs groſly poudered. Then ſhe put an Earthen pan with hot Coals under the woman, and ſprinkled the pouder of Nutmegs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Coals, ſo placing the pan, that the woman might receive the ſmoak through a funnel into her womb by the Water-Gate. At the ſame time ſhe was ſmoaked above with the ſame Fume: Which when it had penetrated into her body, the woman preſently cries out, I muſt needs go to ſtool: which ſhe had hardly ſpoken, but a fizzing and ſound was heard, ſuch as is made when Gun-pouder is fired being ſhut in a narrow box: which wind being expelled, the woman was perfectly well in a moment. Being adviſed by this Experiment, having upon like occaſion uſed the like Remedy, I have very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten found it to do much good.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the ſame caſe, Cupping-Glaſſes with much flame, is profitably ſet upon the Navel, for it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently diſpels wind.</p>
                     <p>If the Diſeaſe come from Humors, Iſſues are to be made in the Thighs, that by thoſe Fountains the filth of the womb may be by little and little drained out.</p>
                     <p>Brimſtone and Nitrous Baths are commended likewiſe by many, both to drink, and to be waſhed in; provided there be no great heat of the Liver or whol Body, conjoyned with this Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>For the pain of the womb, which is frequently troubleſom in this Diſeaſe, <hi>Amatus Luſitanus</hi> commends the water or Decoction of Chamomel flowers, given to the quantity of four or five ounces.</p>
                     <p>And finally, If the Inflation or puffing up of the womb happen after Child-birth, there wil need no other Purgation than that by the womb: Which if it find any hinderance, it muſt be helped for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by drawing Peſſaries, and by Cupping-Glaſſes faſtened to the Thighs, and by other Medicines deſcribed in our Chapter of Suppreſſion of Courſes. And if there be wind, the Fumigation made of Nutmegaforeſaid, will be moſt ſeaſonable.</p>

                        <hi>Chap. 11.</hi> Of the falling down of the Womb.</head>
                     <p>WHen the womb loſeth its Natural Scituation, and fals towards the Water-Gate, the Diſeaſe is termed, the falling down, or ſlipping forward of the womb.</p>
                     <p>Many Differences there are of this Diſeaſe, differing only in degrees: For ſomtimes only the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner neck falls down into the Water-gate: ſomtimes the whol body of the womb fals downwards, but does not appear without the Water-Gate, in the threſhold whereof appears the inner mouth of the womb, in likeneſs of a mans Yard, or a Gooſe Egg with an hole in it. Other whiles with the bottom turned out, it hangs without the Water-gate like a mans Cod, or an Oſtridges Egg, ſave that it is rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and hath an uneven ſurface: and it is in a word, ſomtimes ſo reluxed, that it falls ſo far out as to reach the Patients Thighs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="499" facs="tcp:49088:219"/>The immediate Cauſe of the falling down of the womb, is the Rupture, or Relaxation of thoſe Ligaments, which are wont to retain it, and its Neck in their proper place.</p>
                     <p>A Rupture of the foreſaid Ligaments may proceed from all violent Cauſes, as a blow, a fall, dancing and leaping, lifting ſome heavy burden, or carrying the ſame, violent compreſſion of the Abdomen, vehement Coughing which dures long, violent neezing, eſpecially in Child-bed, hard ſtraining to ſtool, difficult Travel, violent extraction of the Child out of the womb, or of the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth; vehement endeavor of the womb to caſt out ſomwhat offenſive thereunto, as a dead Child, a Mole, or an After-birth: for then, according to <hi>Galen,</hi> in his Third Book of Natural Faculties, the ſame thing betides the womb, which is wont to happen to two wraſtlers who endeavor to throw one the other upon the ground, till both fall together. Hereunto add, frequent ſetting of Cupping-Glaſſes upon the Thighs, and very vehement agitation of Body, or of Mind.</p>
                     <p>Relaxation or ſlackening of the Ligaments is cauſed likewiſe by divers cauſes, as by a long-laſting Catarth, divers Crudities, which are caſt out into the womb, as the ſink of the whol Body. Whence it is that women long troubled with the Whites, can ſcarce avoid this Diſeaſe, eſpecially elderly wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men which are moſt of all troubled therewith. Add hereunto external cauſes, as over-frequent bathing, eſpecially in cold water; Southern and moiſt Air, eſpecially being received into the womb after Child birth; moiſt Diet, much drinking; Idleneſs, long ſleep, and all other cauſes, which may decreaſe flegm, and cauſe its flux into the womb.</p>
                     <p>The Signs whereby to know this Diſeaſe are evident to the ſence. For the womb is found ſticking in the Water-gate like an Hens or Gooſes Egg, or like a Clew of Thrid, with the perceivance of a weight preſſing upon the Water-Gate, when the Patient ſtands upright. And while they ſit or go to ſtool, a vehement pain is felt about the privy Parts, and the Region of <hi>O ſacrum,</hi> or the Hanch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone. If it hang far out, the greater pain and heat is felt, the urine comes away by little and little, and makes the womb ſmart as it paſſeth.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes procuring this Falling-down of the womb, may be thus diſtinguiſhed. If it proceed from looſneſs or ſlackneſs of the Ligaments, it comes by little and little, hath the leſs pain, and white Purgations have preceded, or other Cauſes moiſtening the womb, and relaxing the Ligaments thereof. But if it proceed from a breaking of the Ligaments, the pain is more vehement, and blood ſomtimes breaks forth; and ſuch Cauſes have preceded which have been able to break with violence the Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſticks belonging to this Diſeaſe. The Diſeaſe of it ſelf is not dangerous; yet is it very unhandſom and troubleſom, hindering the Patient from freedom to go and walk at will; alſo from Conception and convenient expurgation of her Courſes.</p>
                     <p>Yet may it ſomtimes occaſion death, if pains, Feavers, convulſions, or other grievous Symptomes be joyned therewith.</p>
                     <p>Alſo the womb in this Caſe is ſomtimes corrupted through diſtemper of the Air, or by violent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, and becomes Gangraenated, which neceſſitates it to be cut off.</p>
                     <p>The Diſeaſe being freſh, and the womb coming not far out, is more eaſily cured than when it is an old Infirmity, and the womb comes far out.</p>
                     <p>In yonger women, the womb is more eaſily reſtored to its place than in Elderly women.</p>
                     <p>Falling down of the womb, by reaſon of the Ligaments being broken, is incurable.</p>
                     <p>To come to the Cure. The womb is to be thruſt back into its Natural place, and to be detained there; and the fault of its Bands or Ligaments muſt be corrected; If they be broken, by things that do glue and ſodder together; if they be relaxed or ſlackened, with things drying, aftringent, and ſtrengthening. All which may be done by the following Medicaments.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place therefore, That the womb may more eaſily be reſtored to its place, the Guts and Bladder muſt be disburdened, left preſſing the Neck of the womb, they ſhould hinder its reduction; foraſmuch as the neck of the womb reſts upon the ſtreight Gut, and the bladder reſts upon the neck of the womb.</p>
                     <p>VVhen the Gutts and Bladder are diſcharged of their Excrements, let the woman lie along upon her Back, with her thighs wide aſunder, and her knees drawn upwards, and let her with her hands thruſt her womb inwards; and force it ſtill upwards into the neck, ſo as to turn it inwards as it goes, till all is returned within the cavity of the Belly which ſhould contain the womb. Or if ſhe is not able to do it her ſelf, let her do it by help of the midwife; or uſe a thick blunt ended ſtick with Cloaths wrapt about it, by which it may be forced further into the Cavity of the Belly, than is poſſible by the hands to drive it. Or, for fear of hurting her Body, a Peſſary may be made of Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen Cloth often doubled and rowled together with a ſtring tied faſt thereunto, and accommodated to this ſervice of thruſting up of the womb.</p>
                     <p>But if the womb fallen from its place ſhall, ſwell, ſo that it cannot enter into the cavity of the Belly, the ſwelling muſt in the firſt place be removed. And if there be an inflamation, ſuch things muſt be applyed as are ſit to heal the ſame. If otherwiſe it be blown up, ſuch things muſt be uſed
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:49088:220"/>
as will diſcuſs the inflation. <hi>Rodericus a Caſtro</hi> waſhes the ſwollen womb with a Decoction of Beets, and then ſprinkles it with vineger and ſalt, and ſo when the ſwelling is aborted, he reduceth the ſame.</p>
                     <p>The ſame <hi>Rodericus a Caſtro</hi> writes, that it is very good towards reſtoring the fallen womb, for a Phyſitian or a Chyrurgion to come with burning red hot Iron in his hand and to make as if he would thruſt it into the womb. by that means nature contracts her ſelf, and the womb with her, and any other part that ſticks out of the Body. For he relates that a certain very expert Chyrurgion did by this ſtratagem force Back a mans Gutts, that were ready to come out at a wound in his belly, when other remedies did no good. For holding a great red hot Iron in his hand, the Patient looking on, he made as if he would Clap it upon the wound. VVith the ſudden fright whereof the Gutts were preſently drawn back into their place.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Avenzoar</hi> in his Second Theizir, Tract 5 Chap. 4. Propounds ſome ſuch thing as this. <hi>When this diſeaſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>begins firſt to appear, the Phyſitian may gently cure the ſame. And it is reduced all theſe wayes, viz. by your hand If you pleaſe; and if not make her he on her Back and let ſome Body ſit upon her breſt, and another upon her thighes; and then cauſe her to be frighted putting ſome creeping Vermin upon her Leggs, ſuch as Mice, Efts, frogs and ſuch like; by which let her be ſo frighred as to endeavour to get away by drawing her Leggs and thighs up to her; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all her Members and her whol Body may at once be contracted: by which meanes the Womb will return unto its own place.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Zacutus Luſitanus</hi> following <hi>Avenzoar</hi> relates the following ſtory in the 66 obſervation of his Second Book. <hi>Coming to a woman</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>Which had her Womb fallen down the ſpace of a year &amp; an half, with extream hardneſs; it ſeemed very hard by reaſon of its ſtretching out to be reduced to its place; eſpecially ſeeing</hi> Avenzoar <hi>ſaies, that this work muſt be done before the Womb be grown hard. I deviſed many remedies for this diſeaſe; aſtringent Inſeſſions, Peſſaries, Plaſters, Confections. At laſt, having wraſtled ſtoutly with the diſeaſe, I could do no good. I betook my ſelf to this ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem. I put Mice tied by the tailes, between the womans Leggs. Which running up her Thighs, the woman is mightly frighted, and forthwith</hi> (a ſtrang thing to ſee) <hi>her Womb is reduced into its proper place. This done, The Plaſter againſt Ruptures being laid upon the Region of the Womb and to the Groynes, ſhe remained for the time to come free from that Diſeaſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Before the VVomb be repoſed in its place, it muſt be anointed with the Mucilage of comfrey Roots, or with an infuſion of Gum Tragacanth. Then are pouders to be ſprinkled thereupon, which have no aſperity or ſharpneſs, leaſt they hurt the VVomb or its neck; but of quality rather gluing than aſtringent or binding. Such an one may be thus made.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Frankincenſe, Maſtick and Sarcocolla nouriſhed</hi> (that is, well ſteeped ſo as to drink up as much of the Milk as it can hold) <hi>with Breſt-Milk, of each one dram. Mummy, Gum-arabick, Acacia, Hypociſtis, of each half a dram. Make all into a moſt fine Pouder, to be ſprinkled as aforeſaid.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſame Pouder may be applied in form of an Oyntment, if it be mixed with the aforeſaid mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilages, or Oyle of Saint Johns wort, or ſome other conſolidating thing.</p>
                     <p>After the VVomb is conveniently replaced, all art muſt be uſed to retain the ſame in its place, the woman lying in her bed, a little bending, with her thighes gently ſtretched out and the one reſting upon the other. And let her abide ſome daies in this poſture, and put in at the Water-gate a little wooll, cotton, or ſpunge wet in harſh red VVine, or in Roſewater wherein Acacia or Hypociſtis hath been diſſolved.</p>
                     <p>To further this Retention of the VVomb in its place, Cupping-Glaſſes with much flame are frequently to be faſtened under her Duggs and upon her Navel.</p>
                     <p>Likewiſe ſweet ſavors are be preſented to her Noſe, and ſtinking things to be applied to her Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitalls, unleſ ſhe be ſubject to ſits of the Mother.</p>
                     <p>Let the ſaid Parts be ſomented with a Decoction of aſtringent things made in red VVine and the VVater of a Smyths Forge.</p>
                     <p>Alſo Practitioners uſe a Bath to ſit in, made of the Same Decoction. In which there needs cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For it is to be feared, leaſt in that poſture, the VVomb ſhould again fall from its place, eſpecially at the beginning, while the Diſeaſe is yet freſh. But when it hath held the Patient long, and ſhe is provided of a convenient kind of Truſs, ſuch a bath will do much good.</p>
                     <p>After the ſaid Bath a Fumigation will likewiſe be very good, of Frankincenſe, Maſtich, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darach, red Roſes. Others indeed do commend a Fumigation on made of a ſalted Eel-skin.</p>
                     <p>Injections into the VVomb will work much more effectually than thoſe remedies which are out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly applied: they may be compounded of the Decoction for the Fomentation or Sitting Bath aforeſaid,</p>
                     <p>Oyntments and plaſters will likewiſe be good in this caſe ſuch as were deſcribed in the Immoderate flux of Courſes and in the VVhites; and as ſhall hereafter he propounded to prevent Abortion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="501" facs="tcp:49088:220"/>The Retention of the Womb in its place may likewiſe be holpen, by aſtringent and ſtrenghening Medicaments taken in at the Mouth. And among the reſt, the following Pouder frequently taken is very proper for this Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Mullein two drams: Myrtle Leaves, Garden Parſnep Seeds of each one dram: Shavings of Harts-Horn, half a dram: Aſhes of Cockle-ſhells one dram: red Coral two drams: Make all into a Pouder. The Doſe is one dram with harſh red Wine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Touching theſe aſtringent Medicaments both internal and external it is to be obſerved: that they muſt be warily uſed, it the womans courſes do ſtill flow at their ſeaſons, leaſt they being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed may cauſe more grievous Diſeaſes to follow. The beſt ſeaſon for theſe Medicaments, is when the Patients courſes are paſt.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Remedies are to be contained twelve or Fifteen daies together. Alſo care is at the ſame time to be taken, that the Patient be neither coſtive nor looſe. For if the Excrements be hard, the Womb is eaſily thruſt out by the Patients ſtraining at ſtool; and a looſe Belly doth relax or ſlacken the bands or Ligaments of the Womb.</p>
                     <p>While the foreſaid Remedies are uſed, we muſt reſiſt the Antecedent Cauſe, by ſuch things as ſhall purge out and diſcuſs thoſe flegmatick humours which relax and ſlacken the Ligaments of the Womb.</p>
                     <p>And firſt convenient Purgations muſt be ordered; which muſt not be violent in their operation and diſturbing, leaſt the Womb out of its place again, bringing abundance of humors into thoſe parts.</p>
                     <p>Some allow of vomiting, becauſe it draws the humors into the upper parts of the Body: and in that reſpect it would be profitable, if it were not to be feared in another regard: Namely becauſe it is performed with great ſtraining, and drives the Womb downward, as much as neezing. Yea and experience hath taught that nothing doth more effectually facilitate hard travel, and bring the Child ſooner into the light, than a Vomit given to the Childing woman.</p>
                     <p>After ſufficient Purgation, a Decoction of Guajacum is to be given three weeks together that every day the Patient may ſweat in the morning. And in the Evening let her Belly beneath the Navel be fomented with a Decoction of Sage, Origanum, Marjaram, Time, Feaverfew, Tanſie, Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, Rue, red Roſes, Cyperus Roots, Calamint, Cypreſs Nutts, and the like ſimples boyled in Smythes Forge-water and red Wine. After the Fomentation, the Fumigation and Liniment may be uſed which were before deſcribed.</p>
                     <p>Inſtead of a Sweat-driver, or after the uſe thereof, Bathes ariſing from Sulphurous Mines, will be ſingularly profitable, ſuch as our Balerucan Baths; and experience hath ſhewn that many have bin cured by ſuch Bathes.</p>
                     <p>And that a woman may be ſecure that her Womb fall not down again, which it is very apt to do; or if there be no hope of a perfect cure let her wear ſuch a kind of truſs as is called <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> his Girdle. Whereby women are ſo guarded and defended, that without fear of the falling down of their Wombes they may go about and do their daily buſineſſes; alſo their Womb is thereby defended from the cold. They are made almoſt after the ſame manner, as truſſes that are uſed againſt Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures or Burſtennes.</p>
                     <p>Peſſaries are likewiſe very profitable in deſperate Fallings down of the Womb, which ſome do make of a good long piece of cork covered over with Wax. Others make of Wax alone, ſome round, others ſquare, triangular, oval or any other faſhion; which are conveighed into the Cavity of the Womb, and are never taken out, but keep the Womb in its place: ſo as the women notwithſtanding do all their uſuall enployments, conveniently are enjoyed by Men in carnal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions, do conceive, carry their big Bellies, and bring forth. VVhich is confirmed with many Examples by <hi>Franciſcus Roſſetus</hi> in his Book entituled <hi>De Partu Coeſareo,</hi> Sect. 6. Chap. 5. and by <hi>Bauhine</hi> in his Appendix to <hi>Roſſetus.</hi> All which are tranſcribed word for word by <hi>Schen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kius</hi> and <hi>Sennertus,</hi> in their proper Chapters, where they are to be ſeen.</p>

The Diſeaſe perſevering, their wombs ſwel, ſo that Maidens ſeem to be with Child; and ſomtime their whol Body ſwels, which likewiſe ſeems as it were black and blew through the abundance of blood. But if the cloſure do poſſeſs the neck of the womb, it is perceived in the firſt Carnal Conjunctions, becauſe it doth not admit the Mans Yard.</p>

                     <p>As for the Proguoſtick. If the Cloſure be in the Orifice of the Privity, it is eaſily cured, being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened by a ſlight Section. But if it be in the inner parts, it is much harder to cure.</p>
                     <p>When the Paſſage is ſtopped with a Membrane, its more eaſily cured; but when the cloſure is cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by a fleſhy matter, as it happens after Ulcers, the Cure is more difficult.</p>
                     <p>The Cloſure of the inner Orifice of the Womb is incurable, becauſe the Inſtruments of Chyrurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cannot be applied to open the ſame.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of this Diſeaſe, becauſe it belongs chiefly to Chyrurgiry, we ſhall diſpatch in few words.</p>
                     <p>If the Cloſure of the Womb have been cauſed in the firſt formation, it is to be opened by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting only. The manner of which cutting is largely deſcribed by <hi>Sennertus,</hi> in its proper Chapter.</p>
                     <p>But if the Cloſure have been occaſioned by reaſon of an Ulcer, as it happens in the Whores Pox; it is to be conſidered, whether it be only an excreſcence of fleſh not wholly ſtopping the paſſage, or a perfect and entire growing together of the ſides of the neck, or of the lips. For, if fleſh only be grown up, endeavor muſt be uſed, convenient Evacuations being premiſed, firſt to prohibit the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of that fleſh by drying and diſcuſſing Medicaments, then to diminiſh the ſaid fleſh by Medicines of Frankincenſe, Birthwort, Bark of Frankincenſe, Roſes, Balauſtines, Maſtich, Mirrh, Aloes, and ſuch like. Which not doing the deed, we muſt come unto ſuch fleſh-conſumers as are leaſt painful, as burnt Allum, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum Aegyptiacum,</hi> and ſuch like. And at laſt, if this wil not conſume the fleſh, it muſt be cut off round about, with the ſame Inſtrument where with the ſuperfluous fleſh bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the Noſe, called <hi>Polypus,</hi> is wont to be cut off. But if the neck of the womb be wholly grown together, we muſt try to renew the Ulcer, and with the foreſaid Medicaments to remove the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous fleſh. And if that cannot be, we muſt undertake to cut it, in the very ſelf ſame manner, as we are wont to cure the natural coalition of the neck of the womb.</p>
                     <p>If the paſſage of the womb be ſhut up by ſome tumor, proper Remedies are to be appointed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; ſuch as have been propounded in the Inflamation, Scirrhus, and Cancer of the womb.</p>
                     <p>If it be cauſed by compreſſion of the neck of the womb, or of the inner mouth therof, the compreſſing cauſe is to be taken away, which may be divers, viz.

of a man, doth not conceive. And this defect is termed <hi>Agonia,</hi> or <hi>Atecnia,</hi> that is, Inability to conceive or bear children.</p>
                     <p>And this Barrenneſs or Impotency of Conception, is cauſed divers waies; all which for cleerneſs ſake, we may reduce to four Heads, according to thoſe four Natural Operations which are required to perfect Conception.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt of which is, That the Woman in her Genial Embracements, do conveniently receive the Mans Sperm into her Womb.</p>
                     <p>The Second, That ſhe retain the ſame a convenient ſeaſon.</p>
                     <p>The Third, That ſhe cheriſh and preſerve the ſame in her Womb<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Fourth, That ſhe afford fitting Materials to form the Embryo, or firſt Conception, and duly to augment the ſame, as need ſhall require.</p>
                     <p>Hence Four Impediments of Conception do ariſe; viz. If the woman receive not the Seed; If ſhe retain it not; If ſhe preſerve and cheriſh it not; If ſhe nouriſh it not ſo as it encreaſe and grow.</p>
                     <p>Reception of the Seed is hindered by many Cauſes; by things Natural, things not Natural, and by things Preternatural. Among things Natural hindering the Reception of the Sperm, in the firſt place is recko<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ed, yongneſs of Age, in which, by reaſon of the ſmalneſs and ſtraitneſs of the Genital Parts, the woman cannot receive the mans yard, or not without very great pain, which makes her worſe for Genial Embracements. The ſame effect is cauſed by over great Age, ſeeing that in elderly Virgins, the Genital Parts, through want of being exerciſed in actions tending to Generation, do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come withered, flap, and flaggy, and ſo ſtrait, that they cannot afterwards eaſily <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>dmit a mans Yard. Likewiſe, all ſuch as are naturally lame, with diſtorted Legs, and their Crupper-bone de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, can hardly put themſelves into ſuch a convenient poſture during the genial Embracement, as a neceſſary that the Seed may be duly and rightly received. Hereunto add over great fatneſs, which ſtraitens the Paſſages of the womb, and by greatneſs of the Belly, hinders the right and fit Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the man with the woman. And laſtly, a cold diſtemper of the womb, makes women dull and liſtleſs, ſo that they enjoy no pleaſure (to ſpeak of) in the Genial Embracement, or it is long before they are provoked with deſire; ſo that the inner Orifice of the Womb is not timely enough opened to receive the Mans Sperm.</p>
                     <p>Among things not Natural, Paſſions of the Mind hold the firſt rank, and eſpecially hatred between Man and VVife; by means whereof, the VVoman being averſe from this kind of pleaſure, gives not flown ſufficient quantity of Spirits, wherewith her Genitals ought to ſwel at the inſtant of Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that her womb skipping as it were for joy, may meet her Husbands Sperm, graciouſly and freely receive the ſame, and draw it into its innermoſt Cavity or Cloſet, and withal bedew and ſprinkle it with her own Sperm, powred forth in that pang of Pleaſure, that ſo by the commixture of both, Conception may ariſe.</p>
                     <p>The things Preternatural which can hinder the Reception of Seed, are certain Diſeaſes incident to the Genital Parts, or to ſuch as border neer upon them; as Tumors, Ulcers, Obſtructions, Aſtrictions, Shuttings up, Diſtorſions, Stone in the Bladder, and other ſuch like.</p>
                     <p>The Second fault in Women, which hinders Conception, viz. When the Seed is not retained, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends either upon the over great moiſture of the Womb, namely, when the womb is filled with many excrementitious Humors, by which becoming looſer and more flaggy than is fit, it doth not rightly purſe and contract it ſelf together, ſo as to retain the Sperm; or the Orifice of the Womb is ſo ſlack that it cannot rightly contract it ſelf to keep in the Seed; which chiefly is cauſed by Abortion, or hard Labor in Child-birth, whereby the fibres of the Womb are broken in pieces one from another, and they, and the inner Orifice of the Womb over much ſlackened. And that ſame immoderate moiſture may ariſe both from the proper Conſtitution of the woman, and from external cauſes of moiſture, ſuch as Baths, Idleneſs, moiſt Diet, and eſpecially from the Whites; which flux of Whites happens very frequently, ſince the Womb is as it were the Common-ſhore, whereinto all the parts of the Body do diſcharge their Superfluities, ſo that this is wont to be the moſt frequent and ordinary Cauſe of Barrenneſs.</p>
                     <p>The Third Cauſe hindering Conception, viz. When the Sperm is not ſufficiently nouriſhed in the Womb, depends upon ſuch things as are apt to corrupt the Seed, as every diſtemper of the womb; namely, a cold diſtemper, which extinguiſheth the Seed; an hot diſtemper, which diſſipates the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; a moiſt diſtemper, which robs the Seed of its due thickneſs; and a dry diſtemper conſumes and drinks up the Seed: and thus the Seed being by theſe diſtempers corrupted and degraded from its natural Conſtitution, becomes unfit for Conception. To theſe Cauſes, Authors do add Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts, and Charms, by which all confeſs that Conception may be hindered. Likewiſe external things, as Meats and Poyſons may do as much, ſuch as are reckoned up by Authors, viz. Among Meats, Vinegar, Mint, Water-Creſſes, Beans, and ſuch like: and among Poyſons, or at leaſt ſuch things as have a certain venemous property cauſing Barrenneſs, The Agate or Jet, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="504" facs="tcp:49088:222"/>
Goat or Mule, Glow-worms, Sapphires, Smaragds, and the like. And laſtly, Malignant and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Diſeaſes, may exceedingly corrupt the Seed, and render it unfit for Generation, as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, Leprous Infections, Whores-Pox, ſtinking and cancerated Ulcers.</p>
                     <p>The Fourth and laſt Cauſe of Barrenneſs, viz. When the woman doth not yield convenient mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to form the Conception, and to augment the ſame, depends upon a want of Seed and Menſtrual blood; ſo over yong women and over old, do not conceive, through want of both thoſe Materials. The Age of a woman fit for to conceive, is commonly determined to be from the fourteenth to the fiftieth yeer of her Age. Yea, and though thoſe foreſaid Materials are not wanting, if yet they are ill diſpoſed, they are not fit for Generation. And they may be ill diſpoſed through divers diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and other Diſeaſes; likewiſe by reaſon of bad Diet, producing none of the beſt blood. So wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men which gorge themſelves with much raw fruit, and cold ſmal drink, breed wheyiſh blood unfit for Generation. Yet we muſt needs confeſs, that ſome women have conceived who never had their Courſes, as may be collected out of the Obſervations of divers Authors; yet ſo much Menſtrual blood was collected in thoſe women, as uſeth to remain over and above in ſuch as have their Courſes, though they had not ſo much as to cauſe their monthly Courſes.</p>
                     <p>To the Cauſes hitherto muſtered up, muſt be added a certain diſproportion or unſutableneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Mans Sperm, and the Womans, which makes they cannot be rightly mingled, nor conſpire to the Joynt-making up of an Embrion or Rudimental Infant; though there be in the mean while, no ſenſible defect, either in the Man or Wife. And it ſomtimes happens, that the ſame man can have a child by another woman, and the ſame woman by another man; whereas they have lived together in the married eſtate barren. It comes likewiſe to paſs, That a woman ſhall live with a man for ten or more yeers together, and not conceive child, and afterward ſhall begin to conceive and bring forth: the Cauſe of which accident is, The change of Temperature cauſed by yeers, whereby the Seed comes to have another temper, ſo that being before diſproportioned to the mans Seed, it comes by change of Age to be fitly proportioned thereunto. Now this diſproportion of Seeds, conſiſts chiefly herein; When men much exceeding in ſome quality belonging to their temper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are joyned with wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men which partake of the ſelf ſame exceſs, viz. When over hot men are joyned with over hot wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, over cold men with over cold women; for thoſe diſtemperatures can procure no mediocrity in the Seeds, and other cauſes neceſſary to Generation. Some fly likewiſe to occult or hidden qualities, which make the Sperms to agree, or diſagree, though no exceſs of the firſt qualities can be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
                     <p>To theſe Authors add an hidden kind of Diſpoſition, which makes ſome women barren, though no manifeſt cauſe of ſuch Barrenneſs appear in them.</p>
                     <p>The Signs of Barrenneſs, we will run over according to theſe four ſorts of Cauſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</p>
                     <p>And in the firſt place, Cauſes hindering Reception of Seed are not hard to be diſcovered, being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident to our very Sences. For tenderneſs of Age is eaſily obſerved, and ſo is an over elderly ſtate of yeers; and the evil conſtitution of thoſe parts which border upon the womb, as when women halt, have crooked wreathen Legs, have their Crupper-bone depreſt, or are over fat; as for the cold di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper of the womb, we ſhall treat of that in our third Rank of Cauſes. Hatred between Man and Wife is known by relation of themſelves, or of thoſe that live with them. Alſo the particular Diſeaſes hindering the reception of Seed, as Tumors, Ulcers, Obſtructions, Aſtrictions, ſhuttings up, Diſtorſions, may be known through ſearch of the Genital Parts made by a Midwife or Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion.</p>
                     <p>Of the Cauſes hindering the retention of Seed, which make the ſecond Rank, we ſhall treat of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver great moiſture among thoſe of the third Rank; as for Abortion and hard Travel, they are known by the womans relation.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes of the third Rank, viz. Which have power to corrupt the Seed to require more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite ſigns to know them by, which we ſhall proſecute as followeth.</p>
                     <p>A Cold Diſtemper of the Womb, is hereby known, In that the Woman longs not after Carnal Embracements, and feels little pleaſure therein; her Face is ſoft, whitiſh, and cloudy; her feeling is dull about her Share, Loyns, and Thighs; ſhe voids thin and crude Sperm, and with little pleaſure; her Courſes are ſuppreſſed, or they come every ſparingly, and keep no conſtant orderly time, and they are pale and diſcolored. Add hereunto, Diet preceding of a cooling Nature, conſiſting of a long uſe of Fruits and Herbs, with much drinking of cold ſmal Drink.</p>
                     <p>A moiſt diſtemper of the womb is known by the lax, and ſlap, flaggy, ſoft habit of the womans body, her much ſitting, frequent and almoſt continual flux of Whites; plenty of Courſes, thin and watry, no appetite to fleſhly Conjunctions, heavineſs of her Loyns, aptneſs to miſcarry, plenty of Urine, and a moiſt Diet.</p>
                     <p>An hot Diſtemper is known, by the manly and ſtrong habit of the womans Body, ſuch as is ſeen in Viragoes and Amazones; by a ruddy countenance, black hair of the Head and Eye-brows; a ſtrong

                        </gap>tions, and luſtful Dreams.</p>
                     <p>A dry diſtemper of the womb is known by the ſmal quantity of Courſes; drineſs, itching, and choppings of the Mouth of the Womb; little excretion of Sperm in the Genial Embracement; trouble ariſing from over much carnal Conjunction, and Leanneſs.</p>
                     <p>If the Seed be corrupted, and Barrenneſs cauſed by Witch-craft, all other ſigns will be abſent, which are wont to declare the Natural and manifeſt cauſes of Barrenneſs. There will be likewiſe ſome alienation of minds between the married Couple, of which neither of them can give any hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom account; yea, and ſomtimes they can both of them, but ſeldom ſhoot forth their Seed, and that with Labor and Difficulty.</p>
                     <p>Diet or poyſons that extinguiſh Seed, if they have been taken in, we ſhall come to knowledg there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, by diligent queſtioning of the woman, and thoſe that are about her.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly, Malignant Diſeaſes, ſuch as are of power to extinguiſh the Sperm, as Leprous Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineſs, the Whores-Pox, and ſuch like, are known by their proper ſigns.</p>
                     <p>The fourth Cauſe of Barrenneſs, which conſiſts in defect or badneſs of the Menſtrual blood, is known, firſt by the over great fatneſs of the whol Body, to the nutriment whereof the blood is carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and conſumed, and is not allowed for the nutriment of the child in the womb. The ſame is likewiſe known by great Leanneſs of the Body, and extream ſlenderneſs; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Sect. 5. ſaith, <hi>If a Woman conceive not, and thou wouldeſt know whether ſhe ſhall conceive or not cover her with blankets, and burn ſome perfume under her, and if the ſmell proceed through her Body, up to her Noſtrils and Mouth, know that ſhe of her ſelf is not Barren.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſame <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſuppoſeth that it may be known whether a woman be fruitful or not, by putting a head of ſcraped and peeled Garlick into her Womb; for if the next day the ſmel ſhall come into her mouth, ſhe is apt to conceive; if not, ſhe is barren.</p>
                     <p>Or put Galbanum ſoftened at the fire, and encloſed in Silk, into the womans womb at night, and bind her whol head in perfumed Linnen; if in the morning the crown of her head ſhall ſmel of Galba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, the woman is wel purged, and wil be fruitful.</p>
                     <p>You may try the ſame, if you put a little Balſom mingled with Water, and received in Cotton, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Womb, binding it with a ſtring to her Thigh; for if the womb do draw it inwards, it is a moſt approved ſign of fruitfulneſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Amatus Luſitanus</hi> commends this following as a moſt true ſign: He takes a dram of a Hares Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, which diſſolved in warm water, he gives the woman to drink, being in a bath of hot water, and faſting. If the Woman do then feel pains in her Belly, he pronounceth her fruitful; if not, barren.</p>
                     <p>Many ſeek to know the Barrenneſs of a woman by her Urine, wherein they ſteep Barley: which Barley, if it grow within ten daies, they count it a ſign of Fruitfulneſs; if not, they account it a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain token of Barrenneſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="506" facs="tcp:49088:223"/>And others, Finally, do powr the Womans water upon Bran or Fenugreek, and take it for a note of barrenneſs, if Worms breed there.</p>
                     <p>For a Conclution to theſe Diſcoveries, We ſhall diligently conſider and enquire, whether Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and Generaſion be not hindred by fault of the Man, or any defficiency in him. For in ſuch a Caſe, it were vainly done to torment the Woman with a multitude of Medicines. Barrenneſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the Man, may be known by the diſeaſes of his Genital parts, as inability to raiſe his Yard, want of Sperm, Swelling of his Stones, Gonorrhoea, and the reſt. And it gives ſome token here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, if the Man be faint hearted and Womaniſh by Nature, if he want a Beard, be ſlow in caſting forth his Sperm, and his Sperm be cold, ſo that his Wife feel it cold in her Womb; if he have little or no Luſt to Carnal Embracements, and perceive very little pleaſure therein. And laſtly, If ſuch Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes have preceded which are of power to make the Seed unfruitful.</p>
                     <p>The Prognoſtick muſt be regulated according to the Method of the Cauſes, as we have ranked them.</p>
                     <p>And in the firſt place, Tenderneſs of Age hinders conception only for a time, which cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected till the Woman is more grown. But Elderly years cauſe a Total diſpaire of Conception. But if the Parties Courſes do as yet proceed, in due ſeaſon, there may be yet ſome hope of Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; howbeit very ſmal, eſpecially in ſuch Women as are at the fortieth yeer of their Age; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Women that have had Children younger, are likewiſe wont to Conceive at that Age; yet ſuch as have never been with Child, have little reaſon to hope that they ſhal Conceive at that Age, becauſe the Womb having been ſo long unimployed, is become withered, ſhrunken up and unfit to Conceive Child.</p>
                     <p>Barrenneſs which is cauſed by an evil ſhape of the Members, as in ſuch as are Lame, have diſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Thighs, or their Crupper-Bone depreſſed; is incurable.</p>
                     <p>But if Barrenneſs proceed from over Fatneſs, or ſome diſtemper of the womb not over old, the cure is to be hoped, by procuring leanneſs and by correcting the Diſtempers.</p>
                     <p>That Barrenneſs which is cauſed by other diſeaſes, as by a Swelling, an Ulcer, Obſtruction, whites, want of Courſes, falling of the Womb, Conſumption, Leprous Mangyneſs, Whores-Pox, and ſuch like; is eaſier or harder to cure, according as the ſaid diſeaſes are either eaſie to be cured or hard.</p>
                     <p>For the Cure of this diſeaſe, whichſoever of the cauſes aforeſaid hath produced the ſame; we muſt ſeek the removal thereof.</p>
                     <p>And in the firſt place, the ſtraitneſs of the Genital Parts in regard of youngneſs of Age, needs no cure; for as Age encreaſes, they attain to a convenient wideneſs. But in the mean time, it is neceſſary that the Party abſtain from Carnal Conjunction; becauſe the overſoon uſe thereof, doth ſpoil the natural conſtitution of thoſe parts.</p>
                     <p>Barrenneſs which is cauſed by lowneſs of ſtature, or Elderlineſs of years, is incurable, yet endeavour may be uſed to help the ſame, by Emollient and Relaxing Medicaments, provided the Courſes do ſtill ſlow.</p>
                     <p>Over great Corpulency, muſt be corrected by an extenuating Diet and convenient Evacuations.</p>
                     <p>If Barrenneſs ſeem to ariſe from a bad Courſe of Diet, as in perſons given over much to Belly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheer, to Wine, or ſmall Drink, ſuch women are to be reduced to an exact Courſe of Life; and all exceſs of eating and drinking muſt be avoided.</p>

                     <p>If Barrenneſs be cauſed by Cloſure of the Womb, by diſtorſion, by obſtructions, by Tumors or Ulcers; all theſe muſt be remedied by ſuch Medicaments as are propounded in thoſe Chapters which treat of their Reſpective cures.</p>
                     <p>Barrenneſs depending upon an hidden property in the woman which is natural to her, is incurable, and therefo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>If Barrenneſs come by witch-craft, Charming, or hidden power of Medicaments, there is little place for Phyſick; but the party muſt have recourſe to prayers and ſupplications, which being Zealouſly poured forth, by men eminent in piety, do procure Help from the Almighty.</p>
                     <p>Howbeit againſt Medicines which by a ſecret power do cauſe barrenneſs, certaine Amulets are propounded by Authors, which have a peculiar vertue to reſiſt the malignity of ſuch Medicaments. <hi>Cardan</hi> will have it, that the Pizzle of a Wolf worn about the woman, will fruſtrate all ſuch

Alſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that for the parties concerned, to endeavour confidently to deſpiſe and ſlight all Charmes and Witch-crafts, is very profitable in this caſe. Alſo (if the Author of the Witch-craft be not known) it is good for them to Change their Habitation, and to forſake their Houſes, Beds, wearing Cloathes, and other Houſhold ſtuff, wherein the Charmes are oftentimes concealed.</p>
                     <p>If an hot Diſtemper be the cauſe of Barrennes, the ſame Cure is to be uſed, which was deſcribed in the hot diſtemper of the Liver. But if the Exceſs of Heat be yet more violent, recourſe muſt be had to thoſe things which have bin deſcribed in our Chapter of Womb-fury. But the camphire muſt be let out of thoſe Medicines, Becauſe it is held to be a very great Enemy to fruitfullneſs.</p>
                     <p>Extream Dryneſs, hindring Conception, muſt be cured by a reſtorative Diet; and if the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the fleſh be much, we muſt have recourſe to the Cure of an Hectick feaver <hi>viz.</hi> Uſe of Milk, frequent Bathing, and ſuch like.</p>
                     <p>But the moſt frequent Cauſe of Barrenneſs is a cold and moiſt diſtemper of the whol Body and of the Womb, which is often accompanied with the Whites, whoſe particular Cure muſt be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>And in the firſt place flegmatick humors abounding in the Body are to be evacuated by purging, diuretick and ſudoriſick Medicaments. And certain Revulſions are to be made, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>THe Acute and Chronical Diſeaſes of women with Child are the ſame in Eſſence or Nature, and have the ſame ſigns, with the like Diſeaſes in women not with Child, or in men; wherefore it is needleſs in this place, to ſpeculate thereupon, let the Reader pleaſe to look for them in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Chapters.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="510" facs="tcp:49088:225"/>But the Prognoſtick of theſe Diſeaſes is not the ſame; becauſe in women with Child they are far more dangerous, and very often times mortal. So ſaith <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in Aphor. 31. Sect. 5. For a Woman with Child to be feized by an acute diſeaſe, is deadly. For it the Diſeaſe have a Feaver joyned with it, there is a two-fold danger attending the ſame (as <hi>Galen</hi> ſhews in his Commentary upon this Aphoriſm) one from the Feaver, which will kil the Child; another from the ſlender diet which is requiſite to the Cure of the Feaver, but is not ſufficient to nouriſh the Infant in the Womb. Or if it be an acute Diſeaſe without a Feaver, as the Falling-ſickneſs, Apoplexy, Univerſal Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the whol Body, the Mother and Infant cannot withſtand the violence of the Diſeaſe, neither can they bear ſuch ſtrong Medicines as are requiſite to the Cure of thoſe Diſeaſes. Yet we muſt know that this Prognoſtick is not perpetually true. For we know by the Teſtimonies and Examples in Authors, and by dayly Experience, that many women with Child having acute Diſeaſes, eſcape with their lives.</p>
                     <p>But Chronical or lingering Diſeaſes, as Intermitting Agues, Catarrhs, Teneſmus, &amp;c. do threaten Abortion, and if they cauſe it not, they can hardly be cured before the woman be brought to bed, but do keep her company till ſhe lie down.</p>
                     <p>Diſeaſes Acute and Chronical in the firſt and laſt months, are more dangerous, than in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate months. For in the firſt months, the bands wherewith the Infant is faſtened to the Womb are weak, ſo as they may eaſily be broken, and the tender Infant is more eaſily over preſſed with thoſe preternatural Cauſes. But in the laſt months, namely, the ſixth, ſeventh, and eighth, the Child be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grown greater, requires much nouriſhment, which in theſe Diſeaſes it is deprived of. Alſo the foreſaid bands do not ſtick ſo faſt as in the third, fourth, and fifth months, in which there is leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Abortion. Therefore <hi>Galen</hi> doth excellently compare the Child in the Womb to Fruits han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging on a Tree, which upon their firſt growing out have very tender ſtalks, ſo that they may be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhaken off with the wind, or any other violent commotion; and when they are neer ripe, they hang not ſo faſt upon the bough, as in the intermediate ſpaces they did.</p>
                     <p>Likewiſe the Cure of the foreſaid Diſeaſes in women with child doth remarkably differ, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching their Diet, and thoſe two grand Remedies, Blood-letting and purging; whereunto we may ad Medicaments which evacuate by other waies, viz. Such as move the Courie, Piſs-drivers, and Sweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drivers, becauſe it is feared leſt by theſe evacuations, abortion may be cauſed: of theſe therefore we ſhall only treat at preſent, referring what elſe belongs to the Cure of theſe Diſeaſes to the proper Chapters, where ſuch reſpective Diſeaſes are handled.</p>
                     <p>As for Matter of Diet it is not to women with Child in Acute Diſeaſes to be enjoyned ſo ſpare, leſt the little Infant be famiſhed; neither is it to be allowed ſo liberal, that the Feaver ſhould be thereby ſtrengthened; but we muſt ſteer a middle courſe, with this Caution, That in the firſt months of their Belly-burden, a thin Diet be enjoyned, and in the latter ſomwhat more ſolid and plentiful, becauſe the Child doth then ſtand in need of more nouriſhment. Yet if there muſt needs be ſome error in Diet, it is better to err in keeping too full, than too ſlender diet; for recovery is chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be expected from the ſtrength of the Mother, and the Child.</p>
                     <p>Touching bleeding, that Aphoriſm of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> viz. the 31. of Sect. 5. is preſently brought in oppoſition, where he ſaies, <hi>If a woman with child be let blood, ſhe miſcarries, eſpecially if the child be grown.</hi> And <hi>Galen</hi> renders the Reaſon in his Comment, Becauſe the Blood being let out, the Infant wants its nouriſhment, whence follows Abortion. On the other ſide, daily Experience ſhews, That in very many Diſeaſes of big-bellyed women, eſpecially acute diſeaſes, as the Pleuriſie, Inflamation of the Lungs, continual Feavers, and ſuch like, blood-letting is neceſſary, and may be adminiſtred, not only in the firſt but alſo in the middle months, and ſomtimes in the laſt months of a womans Belly-bearing. Which if it be omitted, both Mother and Child are in great danger of death. And to this latter Opinion the elder Phyſitians aſſent, not diſſenting from the Mind of <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> by ſo doing. For therefore it is they held a woman would miſcarry, if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Child, ſhe were let blood, becauſe blood being taken away, the Child would want its Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment. So that if blood may ſo be taken away, as that the Infant ſhall not want its nouriſhment, there wil be no danger of Abortion thereby.</p>
                     <p>Now ſo the caſe may ſtand: As firſt, In the firſt Months of a Womans Belly-bearing, while the Infant in the womb is little, and wants but little Nouriſhment, for then its Nouriſhment by bleeding will not be drawn away, eſpecially if certain ſigns of ſuperfluity of blood be apparent in the Mother. So that from the firſt month to the fift blood-letting, may be ſafely practiſed. But in the middle and laſt Months, greater circumſpection is to be uſed, becauſe the Child being greater, and wanting more Nouriſhment, cannot ſo ſafely admit of Phlebotomy. Howbeit, if the Woman abound with blood, and a ſmal quantity be taken away, ſhe may ſafely be let blood, becauſe hereby the Diſeaſe will be allaied; neither wil ſo much Nutriment be there by withdrawn from the Child, as to cauſe Abortion. But if it ſeem that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> thought otherwiſe, let us conſider that we let blood after a far other faſhion than the Antients did, they let blood by pounds, and we by ounces. The very truth is, there
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:49088:225"/>
is no better way to preſerve women from Abortion, than by blood-letting, when it ſprings from over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much blood ſtrangling the Infant, and overwhelming the ſame, in ſuch women as have been accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med out of their time of being with child to have a plentiful flux of Courſes for divers daies together. Thus <hi>Petrus Salius Diverſus</hi> in the 22. Chapter of his Book of particular Diſeaſes: <hi>I for my part proteſt</hi> (quoth he) <hi>that I have preſerved many women from Abortion, which they had often ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, only by letting them blood in the firſt months of their being big. Neither would I have it thought, that no other kind of blood-letting may be practiſed in childing women, ſave that which is sparing or moderate. For ſomtimes plentiful bleeding in the laſt month hath done very much good. And I have ſomtimes experienced this plentiful Blood-letting in the laſt month, when the women with Child were afflicted with a burning Feaver, and were full of Blood hoping thereby an abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Feaver, and an haſtening of the Birth, both which I obtain'd by blood-letting, and ſaved both child and mother in danger of death, by this only Remedy. Which being in ſome Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents omitted, and neglected by Phyſitians, minding more the words of</hi> Hippocrates, <hi>than the matter it ſelf, hath been the cauſe that both child and mother hath miſerably periſhed, being ſtrangled by the plenty and fer vency of blood.</hi> So far <hi>Salius. Amatus Luſitanus,</hi> in the 57. Cure of his I. Section, let a woman with child of eighteen yeers of age, blood, in the ſixth month, four times with happy ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, ſhe being in a burning Feaver. And <hi>Rodericus a Caſtro</hi> in his third Book of Womens Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, Chap. 21. writes, that he let a woman of <hi>Liſbon</hi> blood, who had a Pleuriſie in the eight month, and was given over for deſperate by other Phyſitians, four times and no leſs one after another, and ſhe recovered, and had a healthy Boy. And to conclude, If I may freely relate ſomwhat from mine own Experience, I will ſet down the following Hiſtory, which is a rare one, and worthy to be regarded. <hi>The Wife of John Vicules, Citizen of</hi> Montpelier, <hi>had three miſcarriages one after another at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times of her being with child: When ſhe was the fourth time with Child, about the end of the ſecond month, ſhe was taken with the ſame pains of her Belly and Loyns, which had been the uſual fore-runners of her former miſcarriages. I being called to her, and conſidering ſhe was a Sanguine Woman, and full of Blood, preſently cauſed four ounces of blood to be taken from her; and within half an hour the foreſaid pains quite ceaſed, and the Woman was ſo well that ſhe would not uſe thoſe other Medicines which I preſcribed for her to prevent Abortion.</hi> Now thoſe Symptomes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the ſelf ſame time, wherein ſhe was wont to have her Courſes, when ſhe was not with Child. Again in the third month of her being with Child, at the ſame period of time, the ſame Symptomes return upon her: She ſending for me, deſires I would order her to be let blood, ſeeing the month pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding ſhe had found ſo ſudden help thereby. I conſent, and ſhe is again let Blood, with like good ſucceſs as before. In like manner in her fourth, fifth, ſixth, ſeventh, and eighth months the ſame Symptomes returning, in their juſt diſtances of time, ſhe was again let Blood and preſently recovered.

                        </gap> and Luſty.</p>
                     <p>Yet I would not have a young Phyſitian moved with theſe examples be too bold in letting women Blood in their laſt months of being with Child. But the Nature of the Diſeaſes and of the women rauſt be diligently conſidered, that Medicaments may be conveniencly ſuited thereunto. Allwaies remembring that ſins of omiſſion are lighter than ſins of commiſſion, and that it is better in a doubtfull caſe to fall ſhort, than to outpaſs the due and fitting bounds. Yet when he finds the evident indications of Blood-letting, let him boldly draw Blood, firſt enforming the by-ſtanders or friends of the ſick, that there is more danger of abortion, and of the death of Infant and Mother from the Cruellty of the diſeaſe, than from Blood-letting: and allwaies remembring that but little Blood be taken away, that the Child may not miſs of its nouriſhment. And if plenty of Blood require a larget quantity to be taken away, let it be done at divers times and not all at once.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore the foreſaid Aphoriſm of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> does not abſolutely forbid the opening of a vein, but only warnes that Phyſitians be wary what they do in that kind. Which is elegantly delivered by <hi>Cornelius Celſus</hi> in the 10. Chapter of his 2 Book, in theſe words. <hi>The Antients did judg that young and old people could not bear Blood-letting. And they perſwaded themſelves that a woman with Child, let Blood would miſcarry. But experience hath ſince taught us, that theſe are no generall Rules, and there are other conſiderations of more weight, which the Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner is to regard. For it matters not of what Age the Patient is, nor what ſhe hath in her Body, but what her ſtrength is. So that if a young man be weak, or a woman not with Child be weak, Blood is ill taken from them, for the remaining ſtrength dies, and they periſh. But a ſtrong Child, and a ſtrong old man, and a woman with Child that is luſtly, are ſafely cured by bleading.</hi> So for <hi>Celſus.</hi> Some latter Phyſitians have dared to open the lower veins in women with Child, to Cure the Falling-ſickneſs by conſent of the Womb, the venerial and peſtilential Bubo, yea, and to prevent abortion, as we may ſee in <hi>Zacutus Luſitanus</hi> in his Book of Wonderful Cures Obſ. 23. Book, 1. and Obſ. 130 and 151 of Book 2. Who by his own and other mens
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:49088:226"/>
experiments endeavours to prove, that ſuch Blood-letting may be ſafely practiſed. Which I leave to prudent Phyſitians to conſider of.</p>
                     <p>We ſaid about the beginning of this Chapter, that there is no difference in Curing the diſeaſes of women with Child, ſaving with reſpect to the greater remedies; which difference muſt be in them thus determined, <hi>viz.</hi> That the diſeaſes which hold women not with Child, as vomiting, want of appetite and the like; in them being not with Child, they are to be Cured rather by vomiting than by Blood-letting, becauſe they come from evil humors abounding in the ſtomach and the whol Body; but in women with Child, they need rather Blood-letting, becauſe they Spring from Blood retained in in the very beginning of their being with Child. And experience hath taught that the vomiting, which is wont often to trouble women with Child, is in the firſt months of Childing exaſperated by purges; but by bleeding much abated, yea and wholly taken away, if the Blood-letting be ite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated every month till the ſymptom ceaſe.</p>
                     <p>The uſe of Purging in women with Child <hi>Hippocrates</hi> hath defined in Aphor. 1. Sect. 4. Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with Child (ſaith he) are to be purged if the humor offending do work in the fourth month and to the ſeventh, But theſe about the ſeventh leſs. And we muſt take heed what we do when the Child is very young, or old. <hi>Galen</hi> in his Comment ſaies that there is the ſame proportion between a Child in the Womb and fruit upon the true. For fruit when it firſt grows upon the bough, it is held by a very tender ſtalk, and therefore quickly falls, being ſhaken by a vehement wind. after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards when they are grown greater, they are not eaſily ſeparated from the boughs. And yet when they are fully ripe they fall off of their own accord. In the ſame manner women ſuffer abortion in the firſt and laſt months, becauſe in them the Child is not ſo faſt tied to the Womb. But in this Age of ours, purges are wont to be given to women with Child in all the months (very neer) of their being with Child in diſeaſes ſpringing from the tyranny of humors &amp; excrements vitiated, when the matter is in motion and works, or when it is concocted: ſo often as there is more danger ſeared from the evil humor cauſing the diſeaſe, than from the commotion raiſed by the purging Medicaments. Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and harmleſs Medicaments have made Phyſitians bolder in this kind, ſuch I mean as we uſe at this day, as Rhubarb, Myrobalans, Caſſia, Manna, Senna, Agarick and the like. But we muſt allwaies remember that ſaying of <hi>Hippocrates;</hi> and we muſt more freely give purges in the middle months and more warily in the firſt and laſt. Alſo the uſe of Pills is ever more ſuſpected in women with Child; both becauſe they make a greater commotion in the Body, and alſo by reaſon of the Aloes, which by reaſon of the extream bitterneſs is an enemy to the Child, and is thought to open the mouths of the veines. But if ſometimes the uſe thereof ſeems neceſſary, in ſome grevious infirmities of the ſtomach, which are wont frequently to infeſt women with Child the firſt months of their being with Child bearing, let it be carefully waſhed with Roſe-water, that the acrimony thereof may be taken away; or let it be mixt with ſtrengthening and aſtringent things, as Rhubarb, Maſtich and ſuch like.</p>
                     <p>Clyſters are not very ſafe, becauſe by compreſſing the Womb they may cauſe abortion. So that when there is need of them, and in women accuſtomed to that kind of evacuation, they muſt be made in leſs quantity, and of ſuch things as are rather mollfying and lenefying than much purging.</p>
                     <p>In a word, touching Sweat-drivers, Piſs-drivers, and ſuch things as move the Courſes, our Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is, That Movers of the Courſes properly ſo called are never to be uſed in women with Child. And Piſſ-drivers becauſe they likewiſe are apt to bring down the Courſes, ought to be ſuſpected; and if the neceſſity of ſome diſeaſe require the uſe of them, the gentler muſt be made choice of. And finally, Sweat-drivers may be ſafely given, becauſe they drive the humors out, by the habit of the Body, whereby no danger of abortion is incurred, in ſo much that ſome women in the middle of their being with Child, have bin Cured of the whores Pox, without harm to their Child.</p>

                        <hi>Chap. 17.</hi> Of Abortion or Miſcarriage.</head>
                     <p>ABortion or Miſcarriage is the bringing forth of an imperfect or unripe Child. And conſequently a child dead in the Womb, is not counted an Abortion, till it be excluded. So that whether alive or dead Child be brought fourth, not being ripe, nor having attained to the juſt term of growth which it ought to have had in the Womb, it is to be termed an Abortion, or Miſcarried Child.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes of Abortion are ſome internal ſome external. The internal may be reduced to four heads, viz. to the Humors, to the Child, to the Womb, and to the Mothers diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>The humors may cauſe Abortion while they offend in quantity or in quality.</p>
                     <p>They offend in Quantity either by way of exceſs or of Defect.</p>
                     <p>Humors offending by way of exceſs are ſeen in a Plethorick or over-full Conſtitution of Body; for Blood being more plentyfull than is requiſite to Nouriſh the Infant in the Womb, flowes into the veines of the Womb, and is excluded by way of the monthly Courſes, and brings away the Child with it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="513" facs="tcp:49088:226"/>Defect of Humor fitting to Nouriſh, ſprings from ſuch Cauſes, which are able to draw the Nouriſhment from the Child, as faſting, whether voluntary or forced; as when women with Child loath all kind of Meat, or vomit it up again; a thin diet in acute diſeaſes; immoderate bleeding by the Noſe, Haemorrhoides, Womb, or by immoderate Phlebotomy. Whereupon <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in Aphor. 34. Sect. 5. If a woman with Child go very much to ſtool, it is to be feared that ſhe will Miſcarry. Hereunto may be referred extream leanneſs of the whol body, wherein there is not Blood enough to nouriſh the Infant. Of which, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in Aphor. 44. Sect. 5. Speakes thus. <hi>Women with Child being very lean, not by nature, but accident, as famin, long-ſicknes &amp;c. they Miſcarry, untill they get their fleſh again.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In reſpect of the Child, Abortion may happen, if it be over great, ſo that it cannot by reaſon of its bulk be contained in the Womb; hence it falls often out that little Women miſcarry eſpecially if they be married to Men Bigger than ordinary whoſe Children grow very great, and find not in the Womb place large enough to contain them, till they come to their perfect growth. Which made <hi>Hippocartes</hi> ſay In his Book of ſuperfoetation. <hi>If any Woman conceive frequently, and do duly and at a certain period of time Miſcarry, as in her ſecond, third, or fourth month, or later: the narrowneſs of her Womb is in fault, which is not able to contain the Child as it grows great.</hi> Alſo plurality of Children may cauſe abortion, as when two or three or more are contained in the Womb at one time; for then the Womb overloaden excludes the Children before the fit time: which is the cauſe that Women often Miſcarry of twinns. Alſo the dead Child is to be reckoned among the cauſes of Abortion: for as ſoon as the Child is dead; Nature doth forthwith ſet her ſelf to caſt it forth.</p>
                     <p>Abortion happens in reſpect of the Womb it ſelf, if it be not of largneſs and capacity enough, ſufficiently to widen itſelf according as the child grows, as was ſhewed above out of <hi>Hippocrates.</hi> As alſo if there be any thing preternatural in the Womb, as an Inflamation, a Scirrhous Tumor, an Impoſtume and very many diſeaſes beſides. And finally if the Womb be overmoiſt and ſlack, that it cannot contain the Child ſo well as it ought to do.</p>
                     <p>In reſpect of the Mothers diſeaſes, Abortion comes two waies. Firſt of all, when as her diſeaſes are communicated to the Child, whereby it is killed, or ſo weakened that it cannot receive due nouriſhment nor growth; ſuch as are continual and intermitting feavers, the Whores-Pocks and many ſuch like. Secondly, when the ſaid diſeaſes of the Mother, do cauſe great evacuations or great commotions or the Body, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>rge Bleedings, from what part of the Body ſoever, fluxes of the Belly, grievous ſwoonings, Falling-ſickneſs, Vomiting, and <hi>Teneſmus</hi> [that is perpetual going to the ſtool and voiding nothing but a little ſlime<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which above all other diſeaſes is wont to cauſe Abortion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by that frequent and almoſt continual endeavour of going to ſtool, which perpetually attends this diſeaſe, the Muſcles of the Belly are perpetually contracted, and do more compreſs the Womb than the ſtreight Gutt upon which the Womb reſts; which continual compreſſion or ſqueezing of the Womb, doth at laſt cauſe Abortion.</p>
                     <p>External cauſes which further Abortion, do ſome of them kill the Child, others draw away its nouriſhment, and others diſſolve thoſe bands wherewith the Child is faſtened to the Womb.</p>
                     <p>The Child is killed by greivous commotions of mind, as Anger, ſadneſs, Terror &amp;c. meates earneſtly longed for and not obtained, ſtrong purging Medicaments, ſuch things as provoke the Courſes, ſuch things as drive forth the Child; ſuch things as are reckoned by a ſecret property to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Child in the Womb; abominable ſmells, eſpecially the ſtink of a Candle ill put out.</p>
                     <p>The Child is deprived of its nouriſhment, by the Mothers being famiſhed, and by immoderate loſs of her Blood, eſpecially when the Child is big. As <hi>Hippocrates</hi> teaches in the Aphor. 60 Sect. 5.</p>
                     <p>The bands which faſten the Child to the Womb are looſed by vehement exerciſe, Danceing, Running, Rideing, or Jolting in a Coach or Cart; carrying of an heavy weight, or lifting it from the ground, a violent fall and ſquelch, a Blow upon the Belly that mauls the Child, vehement motion of the Belly by coughing, vomiting, looſneſs, neezing, convulſions, crying out, immoderate or over wanton venereal embraces. And in a word, vehement motions of the Armes, by drawing ſomewhat violently to a Body, by turning a wheel, or doing ſome ſuch work, may exceedingly further Abortion or Miſcarriage.</p>
                     <p>The Signs of preſent Abortion are manifeſt of themſelves. But ſuch as go before Abortion, and prognoſticate the ſame, are theſe; An unuſual heavineſs of the Loyns and Hips, a loathneſs to ſtir, Appetite gone, ſhivering and ſhaking coming by fits, pain of the head, eſpecially about the Roots of the Eyes; a ſtraitening of the ſides, and of the Belly above the Navel; the flagging or falling, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuation of the Dugs, which made <hi>Hippocrates</hi> to ſay in Aphor. 37. Sect. 5. <hi>If the Dugs of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with child do ſuddenly grow ſmall, that woman will miſcarry.</hi> For the extenuation of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Dugs in ſuch a caſe, doth ſignifie want of blood in thoſe Veins which are common to the womb, and to the Dugs, by means of which defect, the child is in danger to miſcarry. But if Abortion ſhall

be cauſed by ſome external eſſicient, cauſing violent agitation of the Child in the Womb, and a burſting of the Veſſels, with a pain raiſed in thoſe parts; the Spirits and Blood run ſpeedily to the genital parts, of which the Dugs being deſtitute, grow ſmaller than they were. Furthermore, Plenty of Milk dropping from the Dugs, doth argue weak Child, and conſequently portends Abortion; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in Aphor. 52. Sect. 5.

At the ſame time, the cituation or poſture of the Child is changed; for whereas it lay high and poſſeſſed the middle of the Womans Belly like a Sugar-loof bearing out; it is now gathered, round like a Foot-ball, and roiled down towards the Water gate. Alſo oftentimes there follow grievous Symptomes, as ſhiverings, tremblings, Palpitations of the Heart, Swoonings, and abundant Bleeding.</p>

                        </gap> Abortion may be divers, after this manner:</p>
                     <p>Women are more endangered by Abortion, than by due and timely Child-birth, becauſe it is more violent, and unſeaſonable, for as in ripe Fruit, the Stalks are looſened from the Boughs, and the Fruit falls of it ſelf; ſo in a Natural Birth, the Veſſels and Ligaments wherewith the Child is tied to the Womb, are looſened and untied as it were of their own accord, which in caſe of Abortion muſt needs be violently broken aſunder.</p>
                     <p>Very many women become Barren by their Miſcarriages by reaſon of thoſe exceeding rendings &amp; tearing which do wholly overthrow the diſpoſitions of the Womb.</p>
                     <p>Much bleeding accompanied with fainting, raving, and convulſions, is wont to cauſe death; and <hi>Aresaeus</hi> teſtifies he never ſaw any eſcape, who in the time of their Abortion, or aiterwards, had Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion fits.</p>

                     <p>Abortion is more dangerous in a woman that never bore Child before, becauſe being unaccuſtomed to Pains, and having thoſe Paſſages more ſtrait, ſhe is longer and more vehemently tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.</p>
                     <p>Women very lean or very fat, are more endangered by Miſcarriage; the former, becauſe of their weakneſs; the latter, becauſe of the narrowneſs of thoſe Paſſages by which the Child muſt come forth.</p>
                     <p>Abortion is more dangerous in the ſixth, ſeventh, and eight months, becauſe the Child being the greater, is excluded with the more pain and difficulty.</p>
                     <p>Women which have a more looſe and moiſt womb than ordinary, domiſcarry commonly without danger, eſpecially in the firſt month; becauſe thoſe parts in ſuch women, do eaſily give way, whence their pain and trouble is the leſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in the ſecond Book of Popular Sickneſſes, affirms, That to miſcarry of a male Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of three-ſcore daies old, helps a Woman whoſe Courſes are ſtopped, By ſtopping of Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, he underſtands only their imminution, when women are not ſufficiently, or conveniently purged, at their monthly ſeaſons; for by ſuch an Abortion or Miſcarriage as aforeſaid, thoſe ſtopped paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are opened, and the Blood is drawn towards the womb, which came thither but ſlowly in former times. Our ordinary women ſeem to have taken notice, of the truth of this ſaying of <hi>Hippocrates.</hi> who touching an Abortion of a few months, are wont to ſay by way of proverb, <hi>Amiſcarrying wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is half with child again.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Cure of Abortion conſiſts in Preſervation, for that which is paſt cannot be helped. But all the Symptomes which follow Abortion, are the ſame which accompany women duly brought to bed.
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:49088:227"/>
The Preſervation from Abortion hath two principal Points or Heads: The one concerns the woman before ſhe is with child: The other when ſhe is with child.</p>
                     <p>Before the woman is with child, all evil diſpoſitions of body which are wont to cauſe Abortion, muſt be removed: as fulneſs of blood, badneſs of Humors, and peculiar Diſeaſes of the womb, viz. Diſtempers, Swellings, Ulcers, and ſuch like.</p>
                     <p>Fulneſs of Blood opens the Veins of the womb, or ſtrangles the Infant while it is in the womb. This if it be a pure and ſimple Plenitude, may be cured by Blood-letting, ſuch as ſhall anſwer the quantity of blood ſuper-abounding.</p>
                     <p>But badneſs of Humors, is either chollerick and ſharp, ſo as to open the Oriſices of the Veins, or by provoking Nature, to ſtir up the expulſive faculty, whereby the child comes to be expelled with thoſe evil humors; or by reaſon of plenty of excrements heaped together in the firſt Region, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtending the Belly, it ſuffocates the child; or it vitiates the blood in the whol habit of the Body, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring it unfit to nouriſh the child, or it fills the Veſſels of the womb which retain the child, full of ſlime and ſnot.</p>
                     <p>This Badneſs of Humors may likewiſe be holpen by blood-letting, but it muſt be in a leſſer quantity, ſeeing the principla ſcope of the Cure, is by frequent Purgations, to take away the ſuper fluous Excrements of the Body. And in the ſpaces between Purge and Purge, ſuch things muſt be uſed, as help the diſtemper of the Bowels, mitigate the ſharpneſs of Humors if there be any, or thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the ſaid Humors, in caſe they be too thin. Or if ſlegmatick Humors are too rife, they muſt be diſcuſſed by Sweat-drivers, Piſs-drivers, and other Remedies. Howbeit we muſt diligently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that whatever ill humor abounds, Iſſues are wonderful profitable to prevent Abortion: of which <hi>Zacutus Luſitanus</hi> gives a ſpecial note, in theſe words: <hi>By moſt happy Experiments I have obſerved, That frequent Abortion cauſed by corrupted Humors which ſlow from the whol Body to the Womb, and by their evil diſpoſition or abundance do kill the child, is hereby as by a moſt preſent help prevented. Many women did miſcarry upon this very account, among which ſome having often times brought forth a Child of ſeven months or four months growth, but torn and putrefied, could by no other means be freed from ſo great a Calamity, ſave by Iſſues made in their Arms and Thighs, which were alwaies made at the beginning of the fluxion; by which means they went out their time, and brought forth Children healthy, and not defiled with any Infection.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The peculiar Diſeaſes of the Womb, as over great Moiſture, Swellings, Ulvers, and ſuch like muſt be cured by their proper Remedies deſcribed in the Chapters which treat of them.</p>
                     <p>In women with Child, if the ſame Cauſes be preſent as in other women, the difficulty is yet grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe big-bellied women cannot ſo eaſily bear all kind of Remedies. Yet, leſt being deſtitute of all help, they ſhould remain in extream danger of Miſcarriage and Death, ſome kind of Remedies are to be uſed.</p>
                     <p>In caſe therefore the Patient be too full of blood, ſhe muſt have a Vein opened, though with child, eſpecially in the firſt months; and that the ſecond and third time, if need be. Alwaies remembring that there never be much blood taken away at a time. Of which kind of bleeding we have diſcourſed more at large, in the foregoing Cure.</p>
                     <p>And when there is an abundance of ſome very bad Humors, gentle Purgations muſt be reiterated, eſpecially in the middle months of a womans being with Child. And if a moiſt, rheumatick, ſnotty, or windy diſtemper do annoy the Patient, we may ſomtimes proceed to a Sudorifick Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t, at leaſt a gentle one, in the ſtronger ſort of women.</p>
                     <p>Mean while, in the whol courſe of being with child, aſtringent and ſtrengthening Medicaments are to be uſed, ſuch as have a vertue to hinder Abortion. Many of which have been deſcribed in our Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of immoderate flux of Courſes; whereunto theſe following may profitably be added.</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Kermes, and Tormentil Roots, of each three drams: Maſtich one dram and an half. Make all into a Pouder, of which give the Patient half a dram at certain diſtances of time, or as much as may be taken up upon the point of a knife.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>red Coral two drams: Kermes berries, Date Stones, of each one dram: Shavings of Ivory half a dram: Pearls not bored through, aſcruple. Make of all a Pouder.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or ler her ſwallow every day certain grains of Maſtich in the morning.</p>
                     <p>Our ordinary women do frequently uſe Plantane Seed, which they take in the morning about the quantity of half a dram, with Wine and Water or in an Egg, or Broth, or by it ſelf, almoſt every day, the whol time of their being with Child, and that not in vain.</p>
                     <p>To the ſame purpoſe very effectual Electuaries are compounded, according to this following Example:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Conſerve of Roſes two ounces: Citron peels candied ſix drams: Myrobalans candied, Pulp of Dates, of each half an ounce: Coral prepared, Pearls prepared, and Shavings of Ivory, of each a dram. With Syrup of quinces, make all into an Opiate, of which let the Patient take often the quantity of a Cheſtnut.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="516" facs="tcp:49088:228"/>If a Liquid form ſhall be more deſired, a Decoction of Tormentil Roots, ſweetened with Conſerve of Roſes, may profitably be given.</p>
                     <p>The following Lozenges are very good; for they ſtrengthen, and do by little and little free the Body from Excrements, though ſomtimes they do not viſibly purge.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Mace, the three ſorts of Sanders, Rhubarb, Senna, Carals, Pearls, of each a ſcruple: Sugar diſſolved in Roſe-water, four ounces. Make all into Lozenges, weighing three drams apiece. Let her take one twice a week by it ſelf, or diſſolved in a little Broth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Outwardly Oyntments and Plaiſters are to be applied, made after this manner:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Ship-pitch half an ounce: Frankincenſe an ounce: Maſtich half an ounce: Dragons Blood and red Roſes, of each two drams. Make all into a Cerate or Plaiſter.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Oyl of Myrtles, and Maſtich, of each an ounce: red Sanders and yellow, Hypociſtis, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacia, of each half an ounce: Spodium, red Roſes, of each two drams: Bole Armoniack, Terra Sigillata, Shavings of Ivory, of each two ſcruples: Turpentine waſhed in Plantane Water an ounce: Wax as much as ſhall ſuffice. Make all into a Cerate or Plaiſter; ſpread it upon a Cloth, and apply it to the Reins.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Plaiſters are compounded of the Maſs of <hi>Emplaſtrum pro Matrice,</hi> and <hi>Emplaſtrum contra Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turam,</hi> to be applied to the Region of the Share, and of the Loyns. Or after this manner following:</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>the Maſs or Rowl of</hi> Emplaſtrum pro Matrice <hi>three ounces: Biſtort Roots, Acacia, Hypociſtis, Pomegranate peels, of each half an ounce: Ladanum ſix drams. Moiſten and ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten them with Juyce of Quinces, and make a Rowl of Plaiſter for the uſe aforeſaid.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Concerning Plaiſters it is to be obſerved, That they muſt not be worn long together, but taken off ever and anon; otherwiſe, if they ſtick too long upon the Back, they do ſo heat the Kidneys, that the poor women are ſomtimes troubled with ſharpneſs of Urine, or do ſomtimes piſs Sand, Stones, yea and Blood it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Neither muſt we omit ſuch things which are accounted by a ſecret property of their Nature to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a Child in the womb; as an Aegle-ſtone worn about the Neck, a Load-ſtone applied to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, Corals, Jaſpers, Smaragds, Bones found in the Hearts of Stags, and ſuch like, worn under the Arm-pits, or hanged about the Neck.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Zacutus Luſitanus</hi> in Obſ. 152. of the Second Book of wonderful Cures, commends a Girdle made of the Hide of a Sea-horſe; and if that be not to be had, he ſaith a Wolfs Skin may profitably be uſed inſtead thereof.</p>
                     <p>And that the ſucceſs of theſe Medicaments may be happy, the Patient muſt be enjoyned to reſt and keep her ſelf as quiet as poſſibly ſhe can, both in her Body and Mind; alſo to abſtain from Genial Embracements, which do vehemently towze and diſquiet the Womb. For while the Womb opens it ſelf to comprehend the Mans Sperm, with which it is exceedingly delighted, it drives forwards the lately conceived Child, not yet throughly faſtened in the womb.</p>
                     <p>But if notwithſtanding the Medicines aforeſaid, by reaſon of the vehemency of the Cauſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be internal or external, the Patient be ready to Miſcarry, we muſt apply our ſelves to do the beſt we can, with theſe following Remedies. And in the firſt place, ſo ſoon as pains and throws ſhall be perceived in the lower part of the Patients Belly towards her Share, in her Loyns, and about the <hi>Osſacrum,</hi> we muſt ſeek to allay and ſtop them, both by things given in, and outwardly applied, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the variety of Cauſes. For if Abortion be provoked by Crudities and Winds (which is moſt uſual when it begins from an Internal Cauſe) a Pouder muſt be given, compounded of <hi>Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticum Roſatum,</hi> and Coriander Seeds: Yea, we may give of the <hi>Aqua Imperialis,</hi> if the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of flegm and wind be very great.</p>
                     <p>At the ſame time let Carminative, or Fart-forcing Medicaments be applied below the Patients Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel: ſuch are, bags of Annis ſeed, Fennel ſeed, Foenugreek ſeed, Flowers of Chamomel, Elder, Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, and Stoechados mingled together; Or a Roſe Cake fried in a Pan with rich Canary, and ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled with Pouder of Nutmeg and Coriander, or the Caul of a Wether newly killed, or his Lungs laid on warm.</p>
                     <p>If with theſe means the pains ceaſe not, let a Clyſter be caſt in, made of Wine and Oyl, wherein two drams of <hi>Philonium Romanum</hi> may be diſſolved, or Narcoticks may be given inwardly in a ſmaller Doſe, to allay the violence of Humors and Winds, as we are wont to do in pains of the Chollick.</p>
                     <p>But if by reaſon of contumacious pains that will not be aſſwaged, or of the violence of ſome exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal cauſe, blood begin to come away, Revelling Medicines are to be applied, to withdraw the courſe of the blood from the Womb: ſuch are, Rubbings of the uper parts and painful bindings; alſo Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping-Glaſſes faſtened to the Shoulder-blades, under the Dugs, and under the ſhort Ribs on both ſides. Yea, and if the Woman be ful of Blood, it will not be amiſs to take ſome blood from her, both when ſhe begins to void blood, and eſpecially before it begins to come; and the blood muſt be taken away at ſeveral times, a little at once.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="517" facs="tcp:49088:228"/>And if all this will not ſuffice, but the Flux of blood continues, we muſt proceed to aſtringent and thickening Diet, and Medicaments; and ſo the Pouders and Electuaries formerly deſcribed, may be adminiſtred. Alſo Juyce of Plantane new drawn, and Syrup of Poppies to the quantity of an ounce, with Pouder of Bole-Armoniack, or Dragons-blood.</p>
                     <p>Alſo outwardly may be uſed fomentations binding and ſtrengthening, made of Pomegranate peels, Cyprèſs Nuts, Acorn Cups, Balauſtians, Grape-ſtones, and ſuch like things boyled in Smiths water, and red Wine.</p>
                     <p>Or a little Bag full of red Roſe Leaves and Balauſtians, may be boyled and applied hot to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients Belly.</p>
                     <p>Hereunto may be added the foreſaid Plaiſters and Cerecloaths: Or for to cauſe the more aſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, make a Cataplaſm of aſtringent Pouders, with Turpentine, and the whites of Eggs, which muſt be ſpread upon Tow, or courſe Flax, and applied to the Navel and the Reins warm. The Tow which ſhall be applied to the Navel, muſt be moiſtened with Wine; that which is to be applied to the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, in Vinegar.</p>
                     <p>The two following Medicaments are accounted for Secrets, and it is beleeved they will certainly hold the Child in the Womb, if they be uſed before it be looſened from the Wombs Veſſels.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>twelve Leaves of Gold: Spodium a dram: the Cocks Treading of three Eggs that are not adle. Mix all very well, till the Gold be broken into ſmal Atomes. Afterwards diſſolve them in a draught of white Wine, and give it to drink three mornings together.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At the ſame time let the following Cataplaſm be laid on.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>male Frankincenſe poudered two ounces: five whites of Eggs: Let them be ſtirred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout together over hot coals, alwaies ſtirring them that they may not clodder together: add Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine to make them ſtick, Then ſpread it upon Parcels of Tow, which lay upon her Navel as hot as ſhe can poſſibly endure them, twice a day, morning and evening, on the three daies aforeſaid.</hi>

                     <p>HArd Travel in Child-bearing, is ſuch as keeps not the due and ordinary Laws of Nature, taking up longer time than ordinary, and accompanied with more vehement pains than are uſual, and other more grievous Symptomes.</p>
                     <p>Divers cauſes here of may be aſſigned both internal and external. The internal depend either of the Mother, of the Womb, or of the Child.</p>
                     <p>In reſpect of the Mother, Travel with child may become ſore and hard, by the weakneſs of her Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, either Natural, or in regard of Age, as in very yong and very ancient women, or in regard of Diſeaſes wherewith the woman was troubled during the time of her going with Child, or is ſtill trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. Hereunto alſo Leanneſs, and over great drineſs of the whol body, may be added; as alſo over fatneſs, and groſsneſs compreſſing and ſtraitening the paſſages of the womb; ill ſhape of ſuch bones as border upon, and embrace the womb<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as in ſuch as limp, wind ſtretching the Guts; ſtone or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural tumor poſſeſſing the bladder, and preſſing the Womb; and the ill conſtitution of the Lungs, and other parts ſerving for Reſpiration, becauſe holding the Breath is very neceſſary to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Child.</p>
                     <p>In reſpect of the Womb, divers Diſeaſes thereof may cauſe a ſore Labor, as Swellings, Ulcers, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, Aſtrictions, Stoppages ariſing from preternatural Cauſes.</p>
                     <p>In reſpect of the Child, Hard Travel is cauſed, when there is ſome fault therein, in reſpect of its ſubſtance, its quantity, its figure, and certain things thereunto belonging.</p>
                     <p>The Child is faulty in regard of Subſtance, when it is dead or putrefied, or ſome waies infected, or weakened with ſome Diſeaſe, ſo that it hath no ability to contribute to its own excluſion.</p>
                     <p>In regard of Quantity likewiſe, the Child doth not further its own Birth, which is either diſcrete or ſevered quantity, or concrete and joyned; the former is called Number, the latter Magnitude. In regard therefore of continued quantity, the child is faulty, if the Body or Head of it be over great; which makes the Birth thereof become difficult and laborſom; in regard of the disjoyned quantity of the child or burden, Labor becomes difficult, as when there are more than one in the womb; ſo the Birth of Twins is more painful than of a ſingle Child, for the moſt part.</p>
                     <p>In reſpect of the Figure, or Scituation of the Child in the Womb difficult Travel happens many waies; as when the Child endeavors to come forth with its feet or its hands foremoſt, or puts out one hand only, or one foot; or when it endeavors to come forth doubled, with its breech, or its belly foremoſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="518" facs="tcp:49088:229"/>In regard of the Childs Adjuncts or certain things belonging to the Child, difficulty of Travail happens, when thoſe membranes which encloſe the Child are more thin than ordinary ſo that they come to break, ſooner than they ſhould; whence followed an over quick effuſion of the waters conteined therein, whereupon the mouth of the Womb remaines dry at the time of the excluſion of the Infant; or where the foreſaid Membranes, are more thick and compact than ordinary, by which means, the Child is hardly able to breake them.</p>
                     <p>External Cauſes depend upon things neceſſary and things contingent, the things neceſſary are ſuch as Phyſitians commonly call <hi>res non naturales,</hi> things not natural. So a cold and dry air, and the Northern-wind are very hurtfull to women in travail, becauſe they ſtraiten the whol Body, drive the Blood and ſpirits inwards, and prove very deſtructive to the Infant coming forth of ſo warm a place as the Womb. Alſo air more hot than ordinary diſſipates the ſpirits and exhauſts the ſtrength both of Mother and Child, eaſily introduceing a feaveriſh Inflammation into a Body repleniſhed with ill humors, and exagitated.</p>
                     <p>Meates raw and hard to digeſt, or of an aſtringent quality, taken in a large Quantity before the time of travail, may render the ſame laborious, the ſtomach being weakened and the common paſſages ſtopped, which in this caſe ought to be very free and open.</p>
                     <p>Sleepyneſs and Sottiſheſs do ſlacken the endeavours both of the Mother and the Child, and ſhew nature to be weak.</p>
                     <p>Unſeaſonable ſtirring of the woman doth much delay the Birth of the Child, whenas ſhe refuſes to ſtand, to walk, lie down, or to ſit upon the Midwifes ſtoole, as need ſhall require; or when ſhe is unduely agitated to and fro; whence it comes to paſs that the Child cannot l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ue in a ſitting poſture, or looſes the good poſture it had, by reaſon of the Mothers undue and diſorderly moveing her ſelf.</p>
                     <p>The retention of Excrements at the time of Travail, as of Urin diſtending the Bladder of hard ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements in the ſtreight Gutt; and hemorrhoids much Swelled, do ſtraiten the neck of the Womb, and divert nature from her endeavour of expelling the Child.</p>
                     <p>And in a word, vehement Paſſions of mind, as Fear, Sadneſs, Anger, may very much encreaſe the difficulty of Child birth.</p>
                     <p>To things contingent are referred Blowes, Falls, wounds, which may very much hinder the Birth: hereunto likewiſe appertain the parties aſſiſtant in time of travail to help the labouring woman, viz. ſtrong women and maid ſervants, which may lift her up and ſupport her when ſhe is in her labours, and eſpecially an expert Midwife, which ought to mannage the whol Buſineſs. For if the Midwife err in her office, it is wont to cauſe difficulty of Birth. For ſometimes the Midwiſes do over ſoon exhort the Childing woman, to hold their breath and to ſtrain themſelves to exclude their Child, while the bands which faſten the Child to the Womb, are as yet unlooſed; by which means, the ſtrength of the woman is waſted before hand, which ſhould have bin reſerved to the juſt time of her travail. Yea and the truth is, while the Midwifes do overſoon perſwade the Childing women, that the time of their travail is at hand, they bend all their ſtrength to exclude the Child, and oftentimes violently break thoſe bands with which the Child is faſtened, and caſt themſelves into no ſmall Jeopardy.</p>
                     <p>Hard Travail is known both by the Childing woman, and by the Aſſiſtants, but eſpecially by the Midwife. And in the firſt place, if the woman continue a longer time than ordinary in her Labors, as two, three, four or more daies whereas a truly natural Child-birth ought to be accompliſhed within the ſpace of 24. Houres. Again, it is a Sign of an hard Labor, if the womans paines be weak, and are long before they return, and if her paines are more about her Back than Privities. And the Cauſes of hard travail, are known by relation of the Childing woman, and are for the moſt part evidently to be ſeen. So the weakneſs of the woman, her over leanneſs, or over fatneſs, is perceived by the habit of her Body. Diſeaſes of the Womb are known by their proper Signes. The Childs weakneſs is known by its weak and ſlow moving it ſelf. But the Signes of a dead Child ſhall be declared in the next Chapter. The greatneſs of the Child may be gathered from the ſtature of the Parents, eſpecially when a big-Bodyed man is matched with a little woman. But when there are none of theſe Signes, and the woman labours ſtoutly, and the Child ſtirrs and makes its way ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently, and yet the travail is hard and painful; it is a token that the ſecundine or After-birth is ſtronger than ordinary, and can hardly be broken, which conjecture is more probable, if no water or moiſture come from the woman dureing her Labors. The diſorderly poſture of the Child is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Midwife, and the other Cauſes are viſible to the Eye, as we ſaid before.</p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſtick. Hard-Travail, is of it ſelf dangerous in which ſometimes the Mother, ſometimes the Child and ſometimes both do looſe their lives.</p>
                     <p>If a woman be four daies in Labor, its hardly poſſible the Child ſhould live.</p>
                     <p>Sleepy diſeaſes and convulſions which befall a woman in Travail are for the moſt part deadly.</p>

Let one of theſe with Pepper be ſo tied to her Belly, that the Sight of the Eye may touch her belly: and it will bring forth the Child, be it alive or dead.

                     <p>Heed is likewiſe to be taken that the woman carry no Precious Stones about her, either in rings or otherwiſe, but let her lay them al away: for many of them are conceived by a peculiar property to retain the Child in the womb.</p>

                     <p>If the Child begin to come forth in a diſorderly manner, as by putting out one Foot, one Hand, or any other way; the Mid-wife muſt no waies receive it on that manner, but thruſt it into the Womb again, and compoſe it to a right and natural poſture or form of egreſs. Which muſt be done by laying the Childing woman on her Back in the Bed, with her Head ſomwhat low and her But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks high: and then gently preſſing her Belly towards the ſhort Ribs, and thruſting the Child into the Womb. Afterward let the Midwife endeavour to put the Child into a right poſture for coming out, by an artificial Hand procuring that the Child turn its face towards the Mothers Back, and its Buttocks and ſhighes let her lift up towards the Mothers navel, and ſo haſten the ſame unto a natural manner of coming for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Chap. 19.</hi> Of A Dead Child.</head>
                     <p>IN ſore Travel of Child-birth by reaſon of great and long Labour, the Child is oftentimes killed; and ſomtimes before a womans pains come upon her, the Child happens to die through ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternaturall accidents, ſuch as thoſe which are wont to cauſe Abortion; and if it hath not attained to the due time of natural Birth it cauſes Abortion, but if it have, it cauſes an hard and ſore Travel, Becauſe in a due and naturall Birth, both the Mother and the Child ought to join their Forces, to bring it from the Dark Dungeon to the Liberty of Day.</p>
                     <p>All ſuch things therefore which cauſe difficult Child-birth being in a greater and more grievous degree, are of power to kill the Child. But eſpecially the Child is wont to be kild, if it come in ſo untoward and prepoſterous a figure, that it can by no means be brought forth in that manner neither can the Midwife or Chyrurgion draw it forth, or reduce it to a better Poſture. For while ſticking thus in the mouth of the Womb, it fruſtrates all the endeavours of the Mother ſtraining her ſelf to exclude it: it comes to paſs, that in thoſe ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ainings, various motions and compreſſions, ſomtimes both Mother and Child, ſomtimes the Mother alone and ſomtimes the Child alone doth die. It is to be admired which <hi>Fabricius Hildanus</hi> writes, touching two women which died through hard Labour, in whom their Wombes were found broken a ſunder and the Heads of the Infants in their Mothers Bellies By which we may gather, how ſtrongly a luſty Child doth labour to work it ſelf out of the Mothers Womb.</p>
                     <p>A Dead Child is known, when the motion thereof ceaſeth, which either the Mother did feel, or the Midwife perceive by h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>r hand laid on, or other warm and ſtrengthening things which were wont to awaken and rouſe up the powers thereof when they were in a ſlumber or ſtupified. Alſo the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers find a greater ſenſe of weight, with which and pain of the Belly they are troubled: when they turn from one ſide to another they perceive the Child to roul from one ſide to another like a Stone. The lower part of their Belly feels very cold, the native heat being extinguiſhed and thoſe ſpirits diſſipated, which were formerly in the Child; their Eyes become hollow and troubled: their face and Lips are pale; their extream parts appear cold and of a Leaden-colour: their Duggs become ſlap and flaggy, and at length, when the Child rots, ſtinking moiſtures flow from the Womb, like water and blood: their belly is blown up with vapours aſending thereunto: a filthy ſmell, and a ſtinking Breath comes both out of the Mouthes of ſuch women and from their whol bodies. If the After-Birth be excluded before the Child, it is a certain token that the Child is dead in the Womb.</p>
                     <p>As to the Prognoſtick. A Child dead in the Womb is a very exceeding dangerous thing, and if it be not timely voided forth it is wont to cauſe Feavers, Faintings, Dead-ſleeps, Convulſions and death it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Yet ſomtimes a Child dead in the Womb may be kept a long time, as appears by many ſtories re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by divers Authors, which <hi>Schenkius</hi> hath collected in great number as rare Caſes, and <hi>Senner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> hath tranſcribed out of him, touching many Women which have voided the Bones of Children dead and putrefied in the womb, by their Water-gate, their Dung-gate, and by a Swelling that broke in their Belly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="521" facs="tcp:49088:230"/>I have ſeen one Woman which voided all the bones of her child by her Navel, and her Navel grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afterwards whol again. ſhe recovered her perfect health.</p>
                     <p>The Cute conſiſts wholly in the Excluſion or Extraction of the Child; for ſeeing great danger of life at ends the Mother ſo long as the dead Child is in her Womb, as ſoon as ever by the foregoing ſigns, we certainly collect the Child is dead, we muſt make haſt, to force it out. Which is done by the ſame Remedies which were formerly propounded to haſten the Birth. But among them we muſt chuſe out the moſt ſtrong and effectual, whereunto ſome other things may be added which are yet ſtronger, after this manner:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Leaves of Savin dried, round Birth-wort Roots, Troches of Mirrh, and Caſtoreum, of each one dram: Cinnamon half a dram: Saffron a ſcruple. Mix all into a Pouder. The Doſe is a dram in Savin Water.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Dictamnus Creticus, Savin, Borax, of each a dram: Mirrh, Aſarum Roots, Cinnamon, Saffron, of each half a dram. Mix and make all into a Pouder. The Doſe is a dram in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, or ſuch like Liquor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the mean time, let the Fomentations aforeſaid be applied to the Privities, the Share, and ſpace between the Water and the Dung-Gate; adding Briony Roots, Roots of wild Cucumer, Florentine Orice, round Birthwort, called <hi>Ariſtolochia rotunda,</hi> and Broom-flowers.</p>
                     <p>After Fomentation, anoint the ſaid Parts with <hi>

                     <p>A Fumigation of Galbanum, or an Aſſes Hoof, may be received by a Funnel into the Womb.</p>
                     <p>If the Matter hang long, it will be good, the woman being ſufficiently ſtrong, to give her a purging Medicine; whereby evil Humors, which in this caſe are eaſily collected, may be evacuated, and the dead Child comequently caſt forth.</p>

                     <p>If after Medicines long tried, the dead Child cannot be ejected, we muſt implore the Chyrurgions aid. Who may pull it out, either by Inſtruments, as <hi>Paulus Aegineta</hi> deſcribes the manner, or only help of the hand, as is taught by <hi>Carolus Stephanus, Bauthine,</hi> and others; all which are diligently tranſcribed by <hi>Schenkius</hi> and <hi>Sennertus.</hi>

                     <p>IN a Natural Birth, commonly the Secundine is excluded preſently after the Child, yet ſomtimes it is retained in the Womb, by which means the Mother is in great Danger of her life.</p>
                     <p>The internal Cauſes of this retention are, the over thickneſs of thoſe coats, and their too great compactneſs, by which means they cling more faſt to the ſides of the Womb: their being ſwelled through con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But the external cauſes are, the Cold Air, by force whereof the Secundine is repelled and the Wombs mouth ſtopped; Certain ſmells by which the Womb may be enticed upwards or agitated; ſome greivous paſſion of mind, as fear, or ſuddain terror

or frowardneſs of the Childing woman, which will not abide in ſuch a poſture nor uſe ſuch endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours as are neceſſary to this work; the over great weight of the Infant, by which the Navil-ſtring is broak unawards and the ſecundine is left within; and the Error of an unexperienced Midwife, which cuts the Navil-ſtrings too ſoon, or holds them not faſt in her le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The Retention of the Secundine is a very dangerous thing, and if it continue ſome daies in the womb, it acquires a ſilthy putrefaction, whence ariſeth an acute Feaver, aptneſs to vomit, fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, difficulty or breathing, a Diaphoretick Sweat, Coldneſs of the extream parts, Hyſterical Fits, Fits of Falling-ſickneſs, and at laſt death it ſelf.</p>

                     <p>THe Immoderate Flux of Child-bed Purgations called from the Greek, <hi>Loches,</hi> is not to be eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated from the quantity, or the time of continuance; becauſe that in divers Natures, Ages, and Courſes of Life, it is very different; but from the ill-bearing of the woman and her weakneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from ariſing.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes of this immoderate Flux, are the over wide opening of the Veſſels, or their rending in hard Travel, or the violent drawing forth of the After-birth; or a more than ordinary quantity of blood, which hath been collected in the Veins of the Womb, during the whol courſe of the Womans being with Child; or the thinneſs and ſharpneſs of the ſaid Blood, which doth too much open the Mouthes of the Veins, and provoke Nature to Excretion.</p>
                     <p>Immoderate flux of the Child-bed Purgations is known, as hath been ſaid, from the ſtrength of the woman which is dejected through the exhauſtion of her ſpirits that iſſue with the blood; alſo the blood is clotted, and the Patient loaths all meat, is pained under her ſhort Ribs, feels a diſtention of her Belly; her Pulſe is weak and frequent, her ſight is dimmed, ſhe hath noiſe in her Ears, is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Swooning and Convulſions.</p>
                     <p>As all great Fluxes of Blood are dangerous, becauſe blood is the Treaſure of our Life, ſo immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate flux of the Child-bed Purgations is more dangerous than the reſt, becauſe of the Travel which goes before, and weakens the Patient. But the danger is more or leſs, according to the greater or leſs quantity of the Blood which comes away, and as the Symptomes are more light or grievous which attend the ſame; which made <hi>Hippocrates</hi> to ſay, in the 55. Aphoriſm of the fift Section. <hi>If Convulſion or Swooning betides a Woman upon her Feminine Purgations, it's a ſhrewd ſign.</hi>

                     <p>The Cure of an Immoderate flux of Blood, conſiſts in one only Point, viz. The ſtoppage of the ſaid flux. Yet extraordinary care is to be taken, leſt that be kept within, which by theſe Purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons was wont to be carried away, and ſo prove the cauſe of grievous Infirmities. And therefore if the flux do not extreamly urge, we muſt begin with lighter Medicaments, proceeding by little and little if need ſhall require, to ſuch as are ſtronger.</p>
                     <p>And in the firſt place, The violent Motion of the Blood is to be bridled by an incraſſating of thickening Diet, as by Panadaes, Gellies, Rice, Starch, with Calves-foot Broths, Pears, and Quinces boyled, Roſted Fleſh ſprinkled with juyce of Pome-granates.</p>
                     <p>Let her have pretty plenty of Meat, but not at once, but divers times one after another. For by this means the Heat and Spirit which in the Womb do aſliſt to the Expulſion, are called away to the Stomach, and by that means the Patients ſtrength is reſtored.</p>
                     <p>Let her Drink be Water that hath had Iron quenched in it, or Gold, or in which a little Maſtich hath been boyled. Then ſuch things are to be uſed as do revel the Blood into the ſuperior parts, as rubbings and bindings of the upper parts, Cupping-glaſſes faſtened under the ſhort Ribs on either ſide.</p>
                     <p>It is good likewiſe to bath the Patients hands in hot Wine, in which <hi>Confectio Alkermes,</hi> or Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice Treacle hath been diſſolved.</p>
                     <p>Alſo let her Belly be moderately ſwathed with a Rowler or Swath-band; becauſe hereby the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of Blood will be preſſed together, and the immoderate flux hindered.</p>
                     <p>Let Linnen Cloths be applied to her Loyns moiſtened with a mixture of Water and Vinegar, by which the blood contained in the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> is tempered, and the motion thereof hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
                     <p>If the flux be very immoderate, and weaken the Patient, ſo that there is danger of Death, we muſt have ſpeedy recourſe to ſtronger Remedies: Among the reſt, this following Potion hath commonly good ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Waters of Plantane, Orange flowers, and Roſes, of each one ounce: Syrup of Corals, or where it is wanting of red Roſes, one ounce: Sal Prunella one dram: Dragons blood ten grains. Make all into a Potion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the flux do yet continue, a Pouder, or an Electuary for divers Doſes, may be preſcribed after this manner:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Blood-ſtone four ſcruples: Pouder of Bole-Armoniack, red Coral, prepared Pearls, of each one dram: Seeds of Plantane, Coriander prepared, and grains of Sumach, of each two ſcruples, Mix all, and make them into a moſt fine Pouder, of which let her take one dram with the Decoction of Knotgraſs and Syrup of Quinces.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="524" facs="tcp:49088:232"/>Take <hi>Conſerves of Roſes and of Comfrey Roots of each one ounce: Bole-Armoniack, Troches de Carabe and prepared coral of each one dram: with ſyrup of coral or of dried red Roſes make all into an Electuary, of which let her take the Quantity of a Cheſtnut, drinking a little of her ordinary drink after it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Alſo a fomentation and an Oyntment will profitably be applied outwardly, made after this manner.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Topps of the red Maſtich or Lentiſch, Plantane, Cypreſs, Olive, and Solomons Seal of each one handfull: Red Roſe Leaves two pugills: Myrtle Berries one ounce and an half: Cypreſs-Nuts, ſix: Peels of Pomgranates two pugils: Boyl all in Steel-quenched Water and aſtringent harſh red Wine, and with the ſtrained Liquour bath the Privie Parts, very lukewarm, and almoſt coldiſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of the Counteſſes Oyntment or</hi> Uuguentum Comitiſſae <hi>two ounces: J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>yce of Plantane one ounce: worke them together into one Oyntment, to be uſed after the fomentation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Alſo an Injection may be made of the Juyce of Plantane into the Womb, commended by <hi>Galen</hi> in the fifth Book of his Method, or of the Decoction of the foreſaid fomentation.</p>
                     <p>Other remedies not helping, to open a vein in the Arm is a preſent Cure, if the Blood be drown out in diſtant ſpaces of time; for experience hath taught, that many women given over as it curable have by this means recovered.</p>
                     <p>And finally, the diſeaſe ſtill remaining, all Medicines preſcribed for the immoderate flux of the monthly courſes, may be uſed in this Caſe likewiſe.</p>
                     <p>And among the Medicines for immoderate Courſes, Cataplaſmes were propounded to be applied to the ſhare, and Loines; unto which the following Cataplaſm or pultis may be added, very good for all immoderate fluxes of Blood, but eſpecial for theſe Child-Bed Purgations.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Pure Soot from the Chimney not mixt with Dart eight ounces: work it luſtily with the ſtrongeſt Vineger, and make a pultis to be applied to the Reines of the Back.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And it is here ſpecially to be noted touching ſleep; that while the Blood flowes plentifully, the woman muſt not be ſuffered to ſleep, for many by that means are taken away, becauſe the natural heat retiring inward, cauſes the flux to be greater. And if ſleep in ſuch a caſe cannot be avoided, ſome muſt be alwaies by of the ſervants to feel her pulſe and mark how ſhe fetches her Breath.</p>
                     <p>In a word, if clotters of Blood do ſettle in the Womb, and cauſe a pain and ſtretching therein; endeavour muſt be uſed ſpeedily to bring it out, leaſt coming to putrefy, they tranſmit filthy vapours to the Brain and Heart and cauſe a feaver. Therefore the Childing woman, if ſtrong enough, ought to walk gently, or ſtand bolt upright for ſome time together, or to ſit upon the groaning Chair, as if ſhe had liſt to ſtool. And if this ſuffice not, the clotters are to be diſſolved with a warm Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of French Barly and a little Oxymel or honey of Roſes injected into the Womb. But here we muſt go warily to work leaſt while we bring out the clotters, the flux of Blood be afreſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked.</p>

                        <hi>Chap. 22.</hi> Of Suppreſſion of Child-bed Purgations.</head>
                     <p>THe good and happy ſucceſs of Child-bearing doth eſpecially depend upon the convenient and orderly flux of the Loches or Child-bed Purgations; ſeeing the Impurities which have bin collected in the veins of the Womb, during the nine months time of the womans Belly-bearing, are wont to be avoided by theſe evacuations; but if they be ſuppreſſed wholly or diminiſhed, inſinite Dangers and Calamities ariſe thereby viz. acute Feavers, Phrenzies, Madneſs, Melanchollies, Squin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>es, Pleuriſies, Inflammations of the Lungs and other ſwellings, which are for the moſt part ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſe of this ſupreſſion or imminution are, the thickneſs of the Blood, narrowneſs or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the veſſells, which hinders the free egreſs of the Blood; cold air heedleſly received into the Womb, which cloſes the Orifice of the veſſels, taking cold at the feet, drinking of ſmall cold Drink, fear, Affrightment, ſadneſs and other Paſſions of the mind, which withdraw the Courſe of the Blood from the Womb.</p>
                     <p>This Suppreſſion is manifeſt of it ſelf, and the diminution thereof is not to be judged by the Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity which comes away, becauſe ſome women have more ſuperfluous blood and ſome leſs. But the perfect knowledg thereof is gathered from the ſupervenient Symptoms ſuch as are a ſwelling of the Belly, a pain poſſeſſing the nethermoſt part of the Belly the Loines and Groines; redneſs of face, difficulty or breathing, perturbation of the Eyes, ſhivering fits, Feavers, Fainting fits, and other Symptomes related before.</p>
                     <p>The Prognoſtick is drawn out of the Symptomes propounded as ſupervenient to this Diſeaſe, for they being for the moſt part dangerous, the cauſe from which they ſpring muſt needs be very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous likewiſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="525" facs="tcp:49088:232"/>Childing women are freed from the foreſaid danger, if ſome other evacuation happen which may at leaſt in ſome meaſure ſupply the deſect of theſe purgations, as Bleeding at the Noſe or by the hemorrhoid veins: plenty of Urine with a ſooty ſetling, or plentiful ſweating. Or if after ſome daies Lead-colored, black, and ſtinking matter begin to flow forth. But it is to be feared, leſt by the corrupt blood, ulcers ſhould be bred in the womb.</p>
                     <p>The whol Cure of this Malady, conſiſts in the provocation of theſe Purgations, which muſt be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored by ſuch Medicines as provoke the Courſe of the Blood downwards, and open the Veſſels of the Womb.</p>
                     <p>And in the firſt place, Emollient, Purging, and Opening Clyſters are to be adminiſtred, made af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Roots of Marſh-mallows, and Water-lillies, of each one ounce: the long and round Birthwort, of each three drams: Leaves of Mallows, Marſh-mallows, Pellitory, Mercury, of each one handful: Line ſeed and Fenugreek ſeed, of each half an ounce: Flowers of Chamomel and Elder, of each two pugils: Boyl all to a pint. In the ſtrained Liquor diſſolve, Oyl of Dill, and Lillies, of each one ounce:</hi> Hiera ſimplex, <hi>half an ounce:</hi> Unguentum de Arthanita <hi>one dram. Mix all into a Clyſter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let her Thighs be rubbed downwards; let the Toes of her Feet be tied till they ake again; let di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Cupping-Glaſſes be fixed to her Groyns and Hips, and let ſome of them be ſcarrified.</p>
                     <p>If theſe means ſuffice not, open the Veins about the Knees, or of both the Thighs; or the Hemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoid Veins, if Nature ſeem to incline that way.</p>
                     <p>If a Feaver be cauſed by ſuppreſſion of theſe Purgations, a Vein muſt be opened in the Arm, as ſhall be ſaid in the Diſeaſes of Women in Child-bed.</p>
                     <p>This following Fomentation may be applied to her Belly beneath the Navel, and to the Privy Parts.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Roots of Marſh-mallows, Lillies, Briony, Angelica, and Birthwort, round and long, of each an ounce: Leaves of Mercury, Mugwort, Penyroyal, Savine, Calaminth, of each one hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: Lin-ſeeds, and Fenugreek ſeeds, of each an ounce: Flowers of Chamomel, Melilot, Elder, Tanſie, of each a pugil. Beat them and cut them according to art, and put them into two bags, which boyl in Fountain Water, and apply by courſe one after another.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After Fomentation anoint the foreſaid Parts with Oyl of Lillies, Sweet Almonds, and Seſamum, adding thereto a little Saffron.</p>
                     <p>Hereunto may be added ſuch Peſſaries and Fumigations as have been ſet down in our Chapter of Suppreſſion of the Courſes, beginning with the moſt gentle.</p>
                     <p>Let her drunk a Decoction of opening Roots, Cinnamon, and red Vetches with a little Saffron. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Opening Roots, of each two drams: Leaves of Bettony, Endive, Maiden-hair, of each a handful: Schaenanth one pugil: Annis ſeed, and Fennel ſeed, of each one ſcruple: red Vetches a spoonful: Boyl all to a pint and an half. To the ſtrained Liquor ad Cinnamon Water two drams: Syrup of the five opening Roots three ounces. Let her take four ounces twice a day.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Before the Feaver be encreaſed, we may ſomtimes give Troches of Mirrh one dram; with white Wine or Fennel water.</p>

                     <p>Alſo a Purgation may be convenient, ſeven or nine daies after ſhe is delivered, of the Infuſion of Rhubarb, Agarick, or Senna, or with a Laxative Broth made of opening Herbs and Roots with Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na; or with an ounce and an half of Manna diſſolved in Broth.</p>

                        <hi>Chap. 23.</hi> Of Gripings after Child-bearing.</head>
                     <p>GRipings do ſo frequently betide Women in Child-bed, that very few Women are free from them. But they are not wont to ſeek to the Phyſitian for theſe Pains, becauſe within two or three daies they go away. But if they happen more ſharp, and of longer durance than ordinary, they are forced to ſend for the Phyſitian, who before he preſcribe any thing, muſt conſider the Cauſes.</p>
                     <p>The chief Cauſes of Gripings and Pains after Child-birth, are the plenty of Blood, its thickneſs, ſharpneſs, and narrowneſs of the Veſſels. For the Veins of the VVomb, having for nine months forborn their uſual evacuation of blood, and the blood being gathered in great quantity, and by its
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:49088:233"/>
retention becoming thick and ſharp; while it goes through the narrow paſſages, it cauſeth pains, which return by fits, as often as the womb endeavors a new expulſion of blood; which being over, they ceaſe till ſuch time as other blood doth ſeek its way forth.</p>
                     <p>Somtimes theſe gripings are cauſed by Winds, or by Cold received into the Womb, but not ſo often.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Pains are differenced from others which are wont to afflict the Belly, by their continuance, and by the diſtances of holding up, which they obſerve according to diſtant fits of the bloods iſſuing forth: and the women themſelves can eaſily diſtinguiſh theſe pains from all others.</p>
                     <p>Thick blood is known by clottering, but the thin blood by its tenuity, freſh color, or yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowiſh.</p>
                     <p>If the Pain ſpring from wind, it is more wandring, being ſomtime in one part of the Belly, and ſomtimes in another; neither doth it obſerve the diſtances in which the Blood iſſues. If cold Air have entred the Womb, it may be known by a relation of what hath been acted about the ſick woman.</p>
                     <p>Theſe pains are not dangerous, but for the moſt part exceeding troubleſom: therefore muſt be removed or mitigated as ſoon as may be.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of theſe Gripings ought to be directed to theſe ends; viz. That the Veſſels of the VVomb be made wider, the Blood thinner, and its ſharpneſs mitigated. All which may be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed by theſe following Medicaments.</p>
                     <p>And firſt of all, let the Patients Belly be gently ſwathed that her womb may ſettle, and not be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this way and that way, as often falls out after Child-birth, by reaſon of the ſudden eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation.</p>
                     <p>Then give her three ounces of Oyl of ſweet Almonds new drawn, with an ounce and an half of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of Violets, and two ounces of Hippocras.</p>
                     <p>Let Clyſters be caſt in of Milk and Sugar, with the Yolks of Eggs.</p>
                     <p>Or they may be made of a Decoction of Chamomel flowers, and Mugwort in Pullet Broth, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Oyl of Lillies, and the Yolks of Egs.</p>
                     <p>Anoint her Belly with Carminating or Wind-expelling, and opening Oyls, as Oyl of Dill, Rue, Jaſmine, or with this following, which being of great efficacy, ought to be made in time convenient, and kept in the Apothecaries Shop for ſuch occaſions.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Roots of round Birthwort, Orice, and Peony, of each one ounce: Cypreſs Roots half an ounce: dried Leaves of Mugwort, Feaverfew, Origanum, Calaminth, Penyroyal, Dictam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Cretenſis, Wormwood, Savin, Rue, Bettony, and Sage, of each one handful: Flowers of Roſemary, Stoechados, Lavender, Chamomel, Dill, St. Johns wort, and Elder, of each half a handful: Bay-berries, and Juniper berries, of each half an ounce: Seeds of Cummin, Rue, Piony, Carrots, and Agnus Caſtus, of each three drams: Cloves, Nutmeg, Cinnamon, Ginger, of each two drams: Storax, and Mirrh, of each one ounce. Let all being beaten and cut, be ſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in ſix pints of old Oyl, adding a little white Wine. And put them in an Earthen Veſſel cloſe ſtopped, the ſpace of a week; and then boyl them over hot Embers the ſpace of four o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> five hours; then let the Oyl be ſtrained out, and reſerved for uſe. If the foreſaid Oyl be wansing upon occaſion, let the foreſaid ſimples boyl in equal portions of Oyl and white Wine, till the white Wine be conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; then let the Oyl be ſtrained out.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Alſo a Fomentation may be made of the Decoction of Mugwort, Bawm, Bay-leaves, Calaminth, Carrot ſeed, Cummin, and Caraway Seeds, Flowers of Cheiri and Chamomel in Water, white Wine or Milk. Or the following Cataplaſm may be applied.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>three or four Onions well boyled in Water; beat them in a Morter, and put thereto Seeds of Line and Cummin beaten, of each one handful: As much Chamomel flowers: Barley Meal as much as ſhall ſuffice to make all into a Pultiſs. And if need be, add a little of the Water wherein the Onions were boyled. Spread it upon a Cloth, and apply it warm to her Navel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is likewiſe profitable to apply the Skin of a weather newly flead off while it is warm, to her Belly. For this kind of warmth is very neer of kin to our Natural heat, concocts and mitigates the cauſe of the pain; alſo it hinders the Skin of the Belly from gathering into wrinkles.</p>
                     <p>Theſe following Medicines may be given inwardly:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Carrot Seeds poudered one dram: white Wine three ounces: Mix them. Give it warm twice a day.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Nutmeg, Annis ſeed, Cinnamon, of each one ſcruple: mix them into a Pouder to be taken in white Wine; or give one ſcruple of Oyl of Nutmegs in Broth.</hi> Or,</p>

                        <hi>Chap. 24.</hi> Of Acute Diſeaſes of Women in Child-bed.</head>
                     <p>WHat we ſaid before touching the Acute Diſeaſes of women with Child, we may now repeat touching the Acute Diſeaſes of women in Child-bed; viz. That they have the ſame Eſſence, and the ſame Signs, with the like Diſeaſes in women which are not with Child, and in men. So that we ſhal refer the Reader for the Theory of theſe Diſeaſes to their proper Chapters.</p>
                     <p>Now theſe Acute Diſeaſes are for the moſt part, continual Feavers, both Eſſential, as <hi>Synchus pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trida,</hi> a continual Tertian, and the reſt; and alſo Symptomatical, which accompany inward Infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, as the Pleuriſie, Inflamation of the Lungs, Inflamation of the Liver, Phrenzy, and ſuch like.</p>
                     <p>Yet there is a peculiar ſort of Feaver, which beſals almoſt al women in Child-bed, which is called by them the Feaver of their Milk, which is wont to befal them about the third or fourth day after they are brought to bed, when their Milk begins to encreaſe in their Breaſts; and it ariſeth from the reflux of the blood from the womb to the Dugs, and the motion and agitation thereof. Which kind of Feaver is reckoned among the Diary Feavers of the longeſt durance; neither needs it any Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, becauſe within three or four daies, viz. about the ninth after her delivery, it is finiſhed by ſweat. It is diſtinguiſhed from putrid Feavers, becauſe commonly it ſeizes the woman about the fourth day, after her being delivered, and her Dugs begin to be filled with Milk, and to be troubled with hardneſs, pain, and heat; with heat and heavineſs in her Back and Shoulders; alſo her Child-bed Purgations ſlow duly, which ſeldom is ſeen in putrid Feavers.</p>
                     <p>Now putrid Feavers do befal women in Child-bed from three cauſes, viz. Suppreſſion of their Child-bed Purgations or diminiſhing, by the heaping together of bad Humors during the time of their Belly-bearing, which were agitated by her Labors, or by Errors in their Diet. Some add immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate flux of the Child-bed Purga ions, which is rather a ſign of the ſecret badneſs of Humors cauſing the Feaver, but cannot be it ſelf any cauſe thereof.</p>
                     <p>In ſuppreſſion of the Child-bed Purgations, the blood and vitious humors which are collected du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the whol time of her going with child, do flow back again into the greater Veins, and there pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefie, and ſomtimes are c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ed to the Liver, Spleen, and other parts, in which they raiſe Inflamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; or if they abide in the Veins of the womb, they putrefie, and ſo cauſe a Feaver, in thoſe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men which were before in perfect health.</p>
                     <p>But if (the Child-bed Purgations duly flowing) a feaver ariſe, it comes either from ſuperfluity of Choller, or from errors in Diet. Evil Humors agitated by the Labors and Pains of Travel, do eaſily inflame and putrefie, and ſtir up a feaver. Errors of Diet may happen divers waies: And firſt in point of eating in which women that he In, are wont to be very faulty, ſtopping themſelves with
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:49088:234"/>
plenty and variety of Diſhes, which cannot be by them digeſted, but cauſeth putrefaction in their Bodies. Another error is committed when Childing women do unadviſedly expoſe themſelves unto the cold Air, eſpecially while their Milk-feaver is in its vigor, which is wont to be terminated by ſweating and tranſpiration, which is hindered by heedleſs admiſſion of the cold Air, whence it comes to paſs that the Feaver which of it ſelf was void of danger, and would in a few daies have ceaſed, is changed into a dangerous putrid Feaver.</p>
                     <p>There is yet another frequent Cauſe of the Feavers of Childing Women, viz. When the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>births are not wholly caſt forth, but ſome portion remains behind. This happens principally in the Womb-Liver, a part whereof is ſomtimes annexed to the Womb, and left there, doth putrefie; which makes the Child-bed fluxes to come forth greeniſh, ſtinking, and Carrion like; and if within few daies it be not ſeparated from the womb, and excluded, it caſts the ſick woman into great danger of death, ſeeing it may mortifie the Womb.</p>
                     <p>If Clotters of Blood, or any other preternatural thing, ſhal remain in the Cavity of the womb after Child-bearing, it may thereby be known, becauſe the neck of the womb remains ſoft and open, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the inner Oriſice thereof ſhut, neither is the womb drawn upwards; and whereas, when all goes well after Child-birth, the womb is drawn upwards, and its neck and orifice are quickly ſhut. An Example here of is propounded by Dr. <hi>Havey,</hi> in his Treatiſe <hi>de Partu,</hi> concerning a woman, who having a malignant Feaver, and being very weak, miſcarried; and after excluſion of a perfect Child, and uncorrupted, yet being very weak, with a creeping Pulſe and cold Sweats, ſhe was ready to give up the Ghoſt. He feeling her womb, perceived the Orifice thereof lax, ſoft, and very wide; and putting in his fingers, he drew forth a Mole as big as a Gooſes Egg, having certain holes in it contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a clammy, black, and ſtinking putrefied matter, and the woman was ſoon freed from the foreſaid Symptomes, and quickly recovered her health.</p>
                     <p>It happens likewiſe in ſome women that the Orifice of the womb preſently after their delivery, is ſo ſhut up, that the blood contained within the womb, ſuddenly clottering and putrefying, cauſeth moſt ſad Symptomes, and when no Art can bring it forth, preſent death follows. Yet Dr. <hi>Harvey</hi> relates in the place aforeſaid, the Hiſtory of a woman cured by him of this Diſeaſe. The Lips of the Water-gate were ſwelled, and very hot; the mouth of the womb was hard and cloſe ſhut: He opened it a little with an Iron Inſtrument which he forcibly put in, ſo as it would admit an Injection made by a Syringe; and thereupon, clotted, black, and ſtinking blood, ſome pounds in quantity came away, by which means the ſick woman had preſent eaſe.</p>
                     <p>The Prognoſtick of theſe Feavers herein only differs from the Prognoſtick of ſuch like Feavers which happen to thoſe that are not in a childing condition; becauſe through the Labors of Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth, the ſtrength of the patient is more dejected; and by reaſon of the Child-bed Purgations ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed there is a greater redundancy of Humors in the Veins; and in both reſpects the Party is in greater danger.</p>
                     <p>The Deciſion of that famous Queſtion, Whether the computation of the daies of the womans ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ought to be made from the beginning of her Diſeaſe, or from the day in which ſhe is delivered of her Child, makes much to cleer the Prognoſtick of this Diſeaſe, eſpecially to foretel the Criſis. Which Queſtion we ſhal therefore thus briefly determine: If the Birth of the Child were natural, attended with no grievous ſymptomes, and the Child-bed Purgations were as they ſhould be, and the Feaver come ſome daies after, the account ought not to be made from the day of the Childs birth, but from the day the Feaver began, which was provoked by ſome other preternatural Cauſe, viz. Evil Humors lurking within the Body, or from ſome external Cauſe. But if the Child-birth were hard and beſide the Courſe of Nature, and the Feaver aroſe after three or four daies; we muſt reckon from the day of the Childs birth; becauſe then the whol order of the Body began to be overthrown, and the Humors to be diſturbed, which was followed by the Feaver. So in grievous wounds of the wont of the Head eſpecially, though the Feaver come not til after the fourth of fifth day, yet the account is wont to be made from the day of the wound received, becauſe the Humors began then to be in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, and to be diſpoſed to cauſe a Feaver.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of theſe Feavers, differs not from the Cure of other Feavers, unleſs in point of thoſe great Remedies, Blood-letting, and Purging,; in the adminiſtration whereof, there is no ſmal ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which we ſhal briefly endeavor to remove.</p>
                     <p>As for letting of Blood in acute Diſeaſes of women in Child-bed, the diſagreement of Authors is ſo great, by reaſon of the contrary Indications on the one ſide, and on the other, that we can ſcarcely find two of the ſame mind. We ſhal briefly in theſe following Theorems or Maxims, propound that Opinion which cometh neereſt the Mind of the wiſeſt Authors, and is in the courſe of Practice moſt ſucceſsful.</p>
                     <p>An Acute Diſeaſe befals a Child-bed woman, either in the beginning, or in the middle, or in the end of her Lying in.</p>
                     <p>If it happen in the beginning, and the woman be plentifully purged, there muſt be no other eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:49088:234"/>
of blood, than that which is directed by Nature when ſhe rightly and conveniently performs her Operations. But if the Child-bed Purgations are ſuppreſſed, or flow ſparingly, let the interiot Veins be opened, and take a good quantity of blood away: becauſe at that time the Child-bed Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of blood, ought by the appointment of Nature to be plentiful.</p>
                     <p>If an Acute Diſeaſe happen in the middle time of her Lying In, two things are to be conſidered. The one is, Whether the Morbifick matter be contained in one particular place, or if it be diſperſed through the Veins? The ſecond, Whether the Woman hath been conveniently purged or not, in regard of quantity? If the Diſeaſe proceed from matter ſcattered abroad, as in Feavers, and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hath not been fully purged, the lower Veins ought to be opened: becauſe both the Morbiſick Matter wil be diminiſhed, and her Natural flux wil be provoked. But if the woman have been ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently purged, and the Diſeaſe get ground, and the Natural Evacuation have not been ſufficient for the Diſeaſe, the inferior Veins muſt be opened notwithſtanding; and ſo much blood muſt be taken away, that by two Evacuations that may be accompliſhed, which the Diſeaſe requires, according to the Doctrine of <hi>Galen,</hi> in the ninth Book of his Method, Chap. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</p>
                     <p>If the Feaver be very high, and great heat vex the Patient, let that be done which we ſhal preſently declare; which ought to be performed when the Diſeaſe ariſeth of Matter driven into ſome corner, and there putrefying.</p>
                     <p>In a particular Acute Diſeaſe, as the Pleuriſie, Inflamation of the Lungs, Squinzy, and the like; we muſt mark whether the Fluxion be only beginning, ſo that the Diſeaſe is only ready to ſeize upon the Patient, or is in its beginning, and very little blood be collected in the part. For then the inſerior Veins are to be opened, that revulſion may be made to ſuch oppoſite part. For then the inſerior Veins are to be opened, that revulſion may be made to ſuch oppoſite parts as are at greateſt diſtance from the part affected, and by that means that prepoſterous motion of Humors may be ſtopped. But if the fluxion be already in good meaſure begun, and an Inflamation bred which proves very troubleſom, whether the woman be ſufficiently purged, or not, the ſuperior Veins are preſently to be opened right againſt the Part affected, becauſe ſuch an Evacuation draws Blood out of the Part Affected. But if the inferior Veins ſhould be opened, which are neither next the part affected, neither can evacuate therefrom, both the ſtrength of the Patient will be weakened by the evacuation, and that matter which is by Nature driven into a corner, and ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, wil not be thereby diminiſhed. And ſo you muſt either draw all her blood in a manner out of her Veins, to revel the matter of the Diſeaſe from the part affected; or the woman will be killed by the Diſeaſe before ſufficient Revulſion be made. Neither need we fear, leſt by taking blood from the upper Veins, we ſhould draw the Courſe thereof from the womb, becauſe in ſuch Caſes the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior parts of the Body do abound with blood. And although much blood be taken away, yet are not the Veins ſo emptied, that they ſhould be forced to draw new blood from other parts. Yet for the greater Caution, it will not be unprofitable before blood be taken from the ſuperior Veins, to cauſe the Thighs to be luſtily rubbed, and preſently after to tie them with bands ſo hard as to pain the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, which muſt abide ſo bound til the bleeding be over, and a little after they may be looſened; and now and then Cupping-Glaſſes muſt be faſtened to the ſame parts, or at leaſt they muſt be again wel rubbed. So we may procure an evacuation of the Matter offending, and yet preſerve the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral courſe of the blood towards the Womb.</p>
                     <p>The ſame courſe is to be taken in vehement and burning Feavers: For although the matter of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending be diſperſed through the Body, yet is the burning heat ſo great about the Heart and Bowels, that it cannot be ſo wel extinguiſhed by the opening of a ſmal, and far diſtant Vein, as by the opening of a neerer and greater, ſuch as is the Vein called <hi>Baſilica.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Method of Curing may be obſerved not only in Child-bed women, but in other women who are taken with Acute Diſeaſes, and have their monthly Courſes upon them.</p>
                     <p>If in the end of a Womans Lying-In, an acute Diſeaſe befal her, the ſame Courſe muſt be followed as in the middle, the ſame conditions being obſerved; obſerving this for a Rule, That by how much a woman is further from the beginning of her Lying-In, by ſo much more ſafely may the uper Veins be opened; but the neerer ſhe is to the beginning, yea, even in the middle, we are to open thoſe Veins with the greater premeditation. And if the Diſeaſe be not importunate, nor the ſharpneſs thereof require ſuch a thing, and the Natural Purgation be copious, we muſt wholly abſtain. But if the Purgation be ſcanty, we muſt open the inferior Veins to ſupply that which is wanting in the Evacuation. But if the contrary ſhal happen, let us follow that Rule which we preſceibed to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, in the urgency of an acute Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>The uſe of Purging in Childing Women that are held with acute Diſeaſes, ſhal be comprehended in theſe following Maxims.</p>
                     <p>While the Child-bed Purgations do Naturally flow, a Purge is never to be adminiſtred; for it is to be feared leſt Nature be diverted from her buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>But if the Child-bed Purgations are not kindly, we muſt conſider whether their conſiſt its Quantity, or in Quality.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="530" facs="tcp:49088:235"/>If they offend in Quantity, ſo as to be too little, ſo that the woman be purged either not at al, or not ſufficiently: After al Remedies fit to procure theſe Purgations have been given in vain, and the Morbiſick matter appears digeſted, eight, ten, or twelve daies being paſt ſince ſhe was brought to Bed, according to the more or leſs urgency of the Diſeaſe, ſhe may be purged gently, wholly abſtaining from al ſtronger Purgatives.</p>
                     <p>If other Purgations offend only in Quality, ſo that a white flux, or ſome other unnatural color do proceed from her, the Matter being ripe, ſhe may in the laſt part of her Lying-In, be ſafely purged.</p>
                     <p>But this muſt evermore be generally obſerved, That by how much the longer a Childing Woman is diſtant from the day of her bringing to bed, by ſo much the more ſafely ſhe may be purged, and contrarywiſe: For Experience hath taught us, That women wanting their Child-bed Purgations, if after the ſeventh or ninth day they are taken with a looſneſs, they commonly ſcape. But if the Looſneſs ſeize upon them upon the firſt daies, viz. on the ſecoed, third, or fourth, for the moſt part they die.</p>
                     <p>And ſo have we finiſhed the Cures of Womens Sickneſſes; all Praiſe and Honor be given to God therefore.</p>

                        <hi>Chap. 1.</hi> Of Pain in the Joynts, called <hi>Arthritis,</hi> or the Gout.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>ARthritis,</hi> or the Gout, is a pain in the Joynts which comes for the moſt part by fits, ſtirred up by an Influx of Humors into the ſaid Joynts.</p>
                     <p>The parts pained are, Membranes, Tendons, Nerves, and al the Nervous parts that are neer the Joynts, which are ſtretched by the Humor which flows into them, or by their ſharpneſs are pricked and twitched: but the Ligaments which ſpring out of the Bones, are void of ſence. Now the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors which cauſe the Gout, do ſeldom flow into the very Cavities of the Joynts, and that only in an old Gout, and where the Cavities are wider than ordinary, as it happens in an old Sciatica, in which ſomtimes the Thigh-bone fals out of its place, the Ligaments and other parts binding the Joynts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, being looſened, and then the Cavity of the Joynt is filled with a ſnotty kind of flegm, as we ſee in <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> Apor. 59. Sect. 6.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="532" facs="tcp:49088:236"/>It is wont here to be demanded, why the Humors flowing into Nervous and Membranous Parts, and diſtending and twitching then, they ſhould not cauſe a Convulſion. We anſwer, that the Parts affected in the Gout are cheifly Membranes, which being no inſtruments of motion, they cannot cauſe a Convulſion, though never ſo much ſtretched or twitched. And although the Tendons and Nerves ordained for motion ſhould be likewiſe pained, yet do they not cauſe a Convulſion; becauſe to make a Convulſion the Muſcles muſt be drawn back to their Head, and that retraction ought to be made by a contraction of the nerves which are inſerted into them; but when they are gone out from the muſcles, or are come unto their extremity, though they be diſtended, yet can they not contract the Muſcles.</p>
                     <p>Authors do commonly make four forts of Gouts, according to the diverſity of the Joynts affected; <hi>Chiragra,</hi> or the Hand-Gout, when the Pain is in the Hands; <hi>Sciatica</hi> and <hi>Iſchias</hi> when it is in the <hi>Hip. Gonagra</hi> when it is in the knees; and <hi>Podagra</hi> or the Foot-Gout when it is in the Feet. And the Pains of the other Joynts go under the common name of <hi>Arthritis:</hi> though <hi>Pareus</hi> have impoſed proper names upon every one of them drawn from the Parts affected; calling the Pain in the Joynts of the Jaw-bone <hi>Syagonagram;</hi> in the Neck <hi>Trachelagram,</hi> in the Back-bone <hi>Rachyſagram;</hi> in the Shoulder <hi>Homagram;</hi> in the Elbow <hi>Pechyagram.</hi> But theſe names have not been entertained by Practitioners. Therefore its ſufficient to refer the Pains of thoſe Parts to the general name of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thritis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are beſides, other differences of the Gout; as that ſome Gouts are General, occupying all or moſt of the Joynts of the Body; others particular, reſiding only in ſome one Joynt: ſome are ingrafted and Hoeredetary from the Parents, others are adventitious cauſed by external Cauſes and Errors in Diet,</p>
                     <p>Now the Humours which breed the Gout, may have their Courſe not only into the Joynts but ſomtimes alſo into other Parts of the Body as the head, Teeth, ſides, yea and the internal Parts as the Liver and Spleen and ſtir up divers Pains in theſe parts, which Pains are not to be termed the Gout, though they are Cauſed by the ſame matter which Cauſes the Gout.</p>
                     <p>Again all Pains ſeated in the Joynts merit not the name of Gouts for ſomtimes there are Swellings in the Joynts eſpecially in the knees, from which Pains ariſe, occaſioned by thick, flegmatick, and Melanchollick humors, which Pains continue very long, but are not to be reckoned among the Gouts, but have a diſtinct nature of their own. Which difference will more clearly appear by the different Characters of the Gout, which we ſhall deſcribe in our Diagnoſis thereof, that is in the Art of diſcerning the Gout from other Diſeaſes by certain ſignes and tokens.</p>
                     <p>The next and immediate Cauſe of the Gout is a ſerous or wheyiſh Humor, either by its quantity ſtretching thoſe ſenſible Parts which are about the Joynts, or by its ſharpneſs twitching the ſame. That this matter is wheyiſh is hereby known, becauſe thick Humors could not ſo eaſily flow into the Joints, and they would make a more Viſible ſwelling in the Joynts, which is wont to be very little, yea in the begnning there appears no Swelling at all though there be a moſt bitrer Pain; add that the Tumor which is in the Gout, never comes to ſuppuration or ripens of matter, which often happens in other thicker Humors, if they have never ſo little Blood mingled with them, But in the Gout the Blood is drawn to the Joynts, as appeares by the Inflammation of the Parts; yet there never happens any ſuppuration or growing to a mattery Head, becauſe Seroſities or wheyiſh Humors rule the roaſt, and they hinder Suppuration.</p>
                     <p>But this wheyiſh Humor is ſeldom pure and ſincere, but hath other Humors or their ſeroſities and thinner Parts Joyned with it; whereupon great variety ari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>es, according to the greater or leſſer acrimony of the Humors mixed with the wheyiſh Humor, according to which the Pain is more or leſs; the Tumors is ſomtimes notably great and ſomtimes not viſible; ſome are of a red colour, others yellow or white; in ſome the malady is ſoon ended, in others it continues long; ſomtimes a mighty and fervent heat poſſeſſes the Parts, otherwhiles little or none is diſcerned; ſomtimes hot things laid on do good, other whiles they do hurt and cold things help. Howbeit, it cannot be denied but that the wheyiſh Humor may of it ſelf have more or leſs acrimony, according as it hath more or leſs Salt mixed with it: for ſeeing the ſerous or wheyiſh Humor, is wont to diſſolve and drink up thoſe heterogeneous ſalts, which are multiplied in the Body by reaſon of the multiplicity of meats we uſe (whence it is that all the ſerum or wheyiſh Humor in us is ſalt) according as this Humor is more or leſs ſalt, and according as the ſalts mixed there with have more or leſs ſharpneſs, more or leſs Pain is wont to be cauſed.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe in the Gout, as in every Fluxion, for things are conſidered, the matter flowing, the Part ſending that matter, the Part receiving the ſame, and the waies by which the Fluxion is made; ſeeing we have ſpoke of the matter flowing, we are now to ſpeak of the other four.</p>
                     <p>Touching the Part ſending the Humor there is diſagreement among Phyſitians. <hi>Fernelius</hi> would have all the material cauſe of the Gout (which he takes to be thin and flegmatick) to flow from the Head; not from the brain it ſelf, (whoſe excrements are either voided by the noſtrills, or flowing
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:49088:236"/>
through the palate, are driven to the mouth, throat, weſand or ſtomach) but from the external Parts of the Head, ſituate without the ſcull. For ſeeing very many veines derived from the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Jugulars do run thither, he ſaies they do there lay down their thin and wheyiſh excrements, and ſeeing the Skin of the Head is thick and compact, and the Humors cannot eaſily breath through the ſame, in proceſs of time they grow there to a quantity, and as he conceives from thence they flow through the ſurface of the Body, under the Skin, into the Joynts. But others do conceive, that the Head is the fountain of the flood of Gouty Humors, but they conceive thoſe Humors flow from the inner Parts of the Head viz. From the Brain. Finally others there be that give ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that theſe faulty Humors do flow from the bowells conteined in the lower <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>elly, namely from the Liver, Splen, Womb and others, and alſo from the whol Body, through the Veins and Arterie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> into the Joynts. All which Opinions in my Judgment are Partly true and Partly falſ. We Judg they are true in that, they ſay the Humors which cauſe the Gout do flow from the Head by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward Parts, and from the Bowells and the whol Body by the Veins and Arteries: and falſ we ſay they are, becauſe they ſay that only the internal Parts of the Head, or only the external, or only the inferior Bowells do furniſh the Gouty Humor. For ſeeing the whol Body is paſſable to and fro by Humors, all Parts of the Body may ſend their ſuperfluities to the Joynts, if they be diſpoſed to receive them. Now that diſpoſition of the Joynts which makes them fit to receive a Fluxion of Humors (that I may take this occaſion to open the condition of a receiving Part) is their weakneſs, either native from the Parents, or ariſing from other Preternatural Cauſes, which we ſhall ſpeak of by and by. Seeing therefore it is eſtabliſhed by Phyſitians as a moſt ſure maxim, that the ſtronger Parts of the Body empty their excrements into the weaker, we may avouch that all the Parts aforeſaid may diſcharge their excrements upon the Joynts, if they being weakned, cannot ſufficiently reſiſt the ſame. And that the Opinions aforeſaid may be ſeverally refuted: <hi>Fernelius</hi> indeed doth clearly enough demonſtrate, that Humors collected without the Soul, do flow upon the ſurface of the body, and under the Skin creep into the Joynts, ſeeing ſomtimes the Pain begins in the Head, goes thence into the Neck, thence to the ſhoulders, and at length into the Joints. But that Humors do never flow from other places and Parts into the Joynts, he no waies proves, neither is any man able to prove after him. In like manner, they which ſay that ſuch Fluxions come only from the brain, ſeem to contend againſt ſenſe; Foraſmuch as thoſe Parts which compaſs the Joints about, do receive Veins and arteries, by which blood is brought unto them to nouriſh them withall, why may not alſo the wheyiſh Humor collected in the greater veſſells be carried unto the ſame Parts by the ſame waies? <hi>Galen</hi> hath taught this preciſely, in his Comments upon the Aphor. 10. Sect. 3 where he ſhews, that in the knobbs and Pains of the Joynts the profound Parts of the body are pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, the vitious Humors being driven from the principal Parts of the body into the Circumference. This is ſeen by the Feaver which is oftentimes raiſed in the beginning of the Gout; for it is cauſed by wheyiſh excrements conteined in the Veins, put into a commotion and working, when nature ſees her ſelf to expell the ſame, and ſeeing ſhe cannot drive it all forth, ſhe diſcharges the ſame into the weaker and ignobler Parts. Alſo the third Opinion, which <hi>Sennertus</hi> defends, is Void of reaſon, and is herein faulty, becauſe it denies that Gouty defluxions do ever come from the brain. For ſeeing all Parts of the Body both inward and outward, do receive Fluxions from the Brain, how can the Joynts be free from them? And if Humors cauſing a Catarrh do often flow by the Veins and arteries, whence Rhewmatick Feavers daily ariſe; and the Humors conteined in the Veins and Arteries (as <hi>Sennertus</hi> himſelf affirms) do eaſily flow unto the Joynts, it is a clear demonſtration, that a Fluxion is made from the brain into the Joynts. Alſo plentyful Piſſing declares that Humors flow from the brain through the Veins, when the ſaid Piſſing is cauſed by ſome commotion of the brain by reaſon of long abiding in the Sun, or in a very cold air; for then the wheyiſh Humors conteined in the brain are agitated by thoſe Procatarctick Cauſes, and driven into the Veins and Arteries, through which they flow unto the Kidney's and the Bladder, and thence comes ſo plentiful making of water.</p>
                     <p>The next and immediate Internal Cauſe of the Gout hath hitherto bin ſufficiently expounded; now let us proceed to the external and Procatarctick Cauſes or occaſions thereof: which we may for clearneſs ſake diſtinguiſh into three Tribes or Rankes, The firſt Tribe is of them which afford mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter convenient to breed the Gout. The ſecond is of thoſe which do weaken and looſen the Joynts. The third is of them which promote the flux of the Morbifick Humor into the Joints.</p>
                     <p>To the firſt Tribe are referred al things which encreaſe raw and wheyiſh Humors, or any bad Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors whatſoever: as meates of groſs ſubſtance hard to be digeſted, and ſuch as afford many excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, frequent Gluttony and Drunkenneſs; immoderate Carnal Embracements; which is the reaſon that Gout is called the Daughter of <hi>Bacchus</hi> and <hi>Venus;</hi> Idleneſs and a ſedentary life, and intermiſſion of ſuch exerciſes as men have been formerly accuſtomed unto; long ſleep and unſeaſonable watching; intermiſſion of ſuch naturall and artificial Evacuations as men have been accuſtomed unto; fear, Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and continual Care.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="534" facs="tcp:49088:237"/>To the ſecond Tribe are referred vehement motion and Labour; frequent uſe of carnall conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, eſpecially of that which is celebrated ſtanding; refrigeration and humectation of the Joints; frequent Bathing; Contuſion, Luxation and Fracture of the Joints.</p>
                     <p>To the third Tribe are referred, Cold air ſqueezing out the Humors, and Heat melting, diſſolving and agitating the ſaid Humors and opening the ſecret Paſſages; meats of a ſervent and ſalt nature which attenuate the Humors; thin and ſtrong Wine; Immoderate exerciſe, unbridled Lechery, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement anger and other immoderate paſſions of the Mind.</p>
                     <p>The Signs do either foretell the Gout at Hand, or declare the ſame to be preſent.</p>
                     <p>Signes of the Gout at Hand: a Sence in the Joints more exquiſite and quick than ordinary ſo that the lighteſt thing will hurt them; as for example the hard ſitting of a new Shoe, Long walking, a ſmal blow, or a light hitting againſt a ſtone, or ſome other hard thing. A Feaver commonly uſhers in the Gout, which is cauſed by wheyiſh Humors and others conteined in the Veins and arteries, being diſturbed and agitated, whiles nature endeavours to expell them to thoſe leſs noble Parts. But the neerer approach of the Gout, and its beginning as it were, is ſignified by a ſtupidity, and ſence of crawling Piſmires in the Joynts, and a kind of unuſual Heat felt in them.</p>
                     <p>The Gout is known to be preſent by an actual pain tormenting the Joynts, which commonly is attended with redneſs and ſwelling; which if it appear not at the very firſt; yet is it ſeen preſently after. The pain doth uſually ſeize upon the great Toe, eſpecially on the left foot, and oftentimes it ſpreads it ſelf from thence into other Joynts. The Feaver which comes before the pain, doth ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times continue; and ſomtimes it goes not before, but comes together with the pain.</p>
                     <p>The Signs of the Cauſes are likewiſe to be conſidered: For although the Humor cauſing the Gout be principally wheyiſh, yet is it needful to know what other Humors are mixed therewith, that we may fit out Medicines thereunto.</p>
                     <p>And in the firſt place, Choller abounding with the wheyiſh Humor, is known by a vehement and cutting pain, a ſmal ſwelling, a reddiſh or paliſh color, great heat, and the Feaver intenſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering in its ſtate or height; thin Urine, yellow and riddiſh; cold things help, and hot things hurt.</p>
                     <p>Signs of flegm abounding with the Whey, are, a ſoftiſh and ſomwhat looſe ſwelling of the parts affected, which if a man preſs with his finger, there remains a pit; the pain is not ſo great, Urines are thick and troubled; Cold things hurt and hot things help; little or no heat is felt: the color is white, little differing from the Natural color of the part.</p>
                     <p>Signs of Melancholly abounding are, an obſcure color of the part like Lead, deep pain, a thin and watry Urine, a wearineſs of the whol Body, and the temper thereof inclining to Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly.</p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſtick. The Gout is no dangerous Diſeaſe, but very troubleſom by the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of pain, and of a very long continuance; ſo that for the moſt part it accompanies a Man du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his life, to his old Age; yea, and it doth cauſe ſome to live long, becauſe Nature at certain ſeaſons drives unto the Joynts vitious Humors, which might cauſe other Diſeaſes; and by ſo doing frees the nobler parts of the Body from bad Humors.</p>
                     <p>Yet doth it often fall out in weak bodies, or ſuch as are decayed with Age, that when Nature can no longer expel ſuch Humors as are collected in the inner parts of the Body, deadly Diſeaſes do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ariſe; as moſt ſharp Feavers, Inflamations of the Bowels, Apoplexies, Convulſion, Phren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zies, Difficulty of Breathing, and inability to breath, unleſs ſitting upright, Pantings of the Heart, and other moſt grievous Infirmities.</p>
                     <p>Although a Diſpoſition rooted in the Bowels tending to breed Goutiſh Humors, and Natural weakneſs of the Joynts cannot be perfectly taken away; yet may the Invaſions of the Gout be very much retarded, and kept off; ſo that ſome only by abſtaining from Wine, others by uſual Purges frequently repeated, have kept themſelves for many yeers free from the Aſſaults of this Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in the Second Book of Predictions, affirms, That many Gouty perſons may be cured, diſtinguiſhing them from ſuch as cannot be cured, in theſe words: <hi>Touching the Gout, this I ſay; All that are aged, or have ſtony knots about their Joynts, or live miſerably, being coſtive, cannot be cured by Art of Man that I know of. Such are well cured by a Dyſentery, when it ſeizes upon them; and by other fluxions of Humors to the inferior parts. But he that is yong, and hath no ſtony know about his Joynts, and lives accurately, being inclined to labor, and having a belly well inclined to ſtool; this man having a skilful Phyſitian may be cured.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>An hereditary Gout may well be accounted incurable.</p>
                     <p>If the Veins of Gouty perſons do ſwel with black blood, their Gout leaves them; out of <hi>Avicen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</hi> Becauſe the Humors which were wont to flow into the Joynts, are derived to the external parts of the Skin.</p>
                     <p>If the Gout, being accuſtomed to return at certain ſeaſons, ſhal not return, it portends grievous, and oftentimes deadly Diſeaſes, unleſs the Morbifick matter by a diligent prevention ſhal be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:49088:237"/>
For if through weakneſs of Nature, the matter which is gathered together within, ſhall not be expelled, it breeds the greateſt and moſt dangerous Diſeaſes imaginable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Whoſoever they bee that have the Gout within the ſpace of forty daies the Inflammation is allaied, and they are freed. Hippocrates</hi> in the 49. Aphoriſm of the fifth Book or Section. For in ſuch Parts as have little Natural heat, the matter offending requires a long time before it can be diſcuſt. Howbeit this period of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> is not certain and perpetual; for ſome are healed ſooner, and ſome later; which depends upon the quantity, thickneſs, or rebellion of the Morbifick cauſes; the ſtrength or weakneſs of the Parts affected and the obedience of the Patients in Point of keeping the Diet, and uſing the Medicaments appointed for them.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of all Gouts conſiſts herein, viz. That the flux of Humors into the Joints may be ſtaied, that which allready is come in and abides in the Joints may be removed, and that the Pain may in the mean while (if it be ſharp) be abated; all which may be performed by the following Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments.</p>
                     <p>And in the firſt place, Letting of Blood will be very convenient, if there be no want of Blood in the Patient, and if flegm do not abound; becauſe the Blood is agitated by the motion of the Humors flowing into the Joints, and does as it were boil, and is by Pain drawn into the Part affected: wherefore it is neceſſary to draw the ſame back, into that Part of the Body which is oppoſite to the Part affected: and therefore if the right Arm be Diſeaſed, a Vein muſt be opened in the left; if the right Foot be Pained a Vein muſt be opened in the right Arm; and if the left Foot in the left Arm. And Blood is to be taken away at the firſt beginning of the Diſeaſe, and as much as needs muſt be taken at one time, if the Patients ſtength will bear it: if not, it muſt be done at ſeverall times, till the plenitude of Blood be ſufficiently diminiſhed.</p>
                     <p>One thing we muſt allwaies remember, that copious Blood-letting in ſuch as can bear it eaſily, does exceedingly ſhorten the Diſeaſe, if it be done at the beginning of the Diſeaſe, at leaſt by Piece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal, drawing now a little and then a little.</p>
                     <p>Alſo Purging muſt be uſed at the beginning of the Diſeaſe, as ſoon as may be: for ſo both that Humor which is influx and is ready to flow, will be drawn from the way to the Joints and be brought unto the Gutts. But in this purgation two things are worthy of obſervation, being frequently noted by <hi>Solenander</hi> a famous practitioner.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, that this Purgation be not made by ſome mild lenitive Medicaments, whereby the Humors are rather ſtirred than Evacuated, and are precipitated into the Joints, whereupon a more greivous Pain and ſwelling is wont to follow ſuch purges; but with ſome ſtrong purgative, which may force out the ſtirred Humor and turn the cauſe there of from the Joints. The other is, that the Medicaments being given, the Joints above the Knees and elbows, be Plaſtered with ſome defenſative, by which the Humor which is put in motion by the Medicine may be intercepted, ſo that it may not ſo much nor ſo forcibly fall down into the Joints.</p>
                     <p>To which intent let an Oyntment be made of Bole, Pome-Granate Rinds, Balauſtians, Roots of Biſtort and Tormentill, red Roſes with the white of an Egg, and Vinegar; which being ſpread upon ſnipps of cloath as broad as ones Hand and indifferent long, let them be wrapped about the Parts aforeſaid. If theſe ſimples be not to be had at preſent, wet them only with Vineger and water and let them lie on at leaſt an whol day. If the Fluxion be vehement, uſe a liniment of Bole, Dragons Blood, the white of an Egg and Oyl of Roſes made with Oyl of unripe olives: or at firſt uſe it without Oyl adding a ſmall quantity of the Oyl aforeſaid or of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum Comitiſſae,</hi> leaſt grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dry and hard it cauſe Pain.</p>
                     <p>And for to procure ſuch a purgation as we have ſpoken of, let the skillful Phyſitian preſcribe a Medicament fitted to the Nature of the Patient and ſuch Humors as are redundant in his Body: or ſome of thoſe Specifick Purgations which we ſhall propound in our Doctrine of Preſervation from the Gout.</p>
                     <p>Vomiting is likewiſe profitable in this Caſe, for ſuch as are eaſie to vomit; becauſe it brings out the evil Humors by a ſhorter way, and ſo there is no ſuch fear leaſt they ſhould ruſh into the Part affected. But gentle Vomits are to be uſed, which do only evacuate thoſe Parts which are near the ſtomach. For if they be vehement, and draw Humors out of the Veins, they may precipitate the ſaid Humors unto the Joynts. Then after vomitings, purgation muſt be procured downwards; yea and if one purgation will not ſerve turn, it muſt be repeated.</p>
                     <p>After ſufficient Purgation, it will be very good to procure ſweat; for ſo the wheyiſh matter wil be diſcuſſed by the habit of the Body. But, ſeeing when the Gout gives its firſt Onſet, there happens a kind of boiling and working of the Blood, and commonly there is a Feaver, hot ſudoroficks will not be convenient, but only ſuch as are temperate; amongſt which <hi>Sennertus</hi> commends Harts-Horn, either crude, or prepared without burning, either alone, or with Carduus Water; as likewiſe <hi>Antimonium Diaphoreticum.</hi> In an old Gout without a Feaver, a Decoction of China Salſa Parilla ar Saſſafras may be given, qualified with coolling Herbs, as Cichory, Endive, Sorrel and
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:49088:238"/>
Or after the Sweat is wiped off, it may ſuffice to give the Patient Chicken-Broth, altered with the Herbs aforeſaid.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Martinus Rulandus</hi> did uſe this following Sweating Medicine with happy ſucceſs:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Tops of Centaury two handfuls: Aſarum Roots two ounces: Boyl them in ten pints of Water to five pints, and ſtrain the Liquor. Give the Patient eight ounces of this Liquor hot, in the morning ſome daies together; and let him ſweat upon it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But <hi>Foreſtus</hi> commends the Roots of the greater Burdock; becauſe it cuts, diſcuſſeth, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes both Sweat and Urine. And he reports that a certain Gouty perſon that kept his bed, and could not ſtir a Limb, drank hot Beer in which the great Burdock Root had been boyled; after the drinking whereof, when the Phyſitians could do him no good with all their Medicines, he piſſ'd a great deal of white Matter like Milk, and was freed from his pains.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hercules Saxonia</hi> puts a great many Loaves hot out of the Oven round about the Patients Body, by which means Sweat is plentifully procured, and the pains removed.</p>
                     <p>Alſo a Decoction of Elder, Bay-leaves, Sage, Roſemary, and ſuch like Herbs wil do much good, the Patient receiving the vapor of this Decoction in a ſweating Tub, which wil make the ſweat to come luſtily.</p>
                     <p>Alſo the Waters of Natural hot Baths do provoke ſweat, and do readily diſcuſs the Matter contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Joynts. And therefore when the ſick are not able to go unto them, their Water is wont to be brought unto them and heated in a Caldron for them to bath in. <hi>Eraſtus</hi> in his 15. Counſel, prefers this above al others, for eaſing the pains, but he boyls ſo much Salt in the Water, as gives it an evidently brackiſh taſt.</p>
                     <p>In the beginning of the Fluxion of Gouty Humors, in the ſpaces free from Purgations, ſuch things muſt be given as ſtop the Flux, which have been propounded by me in the Cure of an hot Catarrh; eſpecially Juleps of Waters, or Decoctions and Syrups which do cool and thicken.</p>
                     <p>Yea, and the truth is, We are ſomtimes compelled to uſe Narcotick or Stupefactive Medicaments; for they both ſtop the flux of Humors, and they mitigate the rage of the pains. Of theſe ſort of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines new Venice Treacle is moſt convenient, which may often be repeated without danger from half a dram to a dram. Unto which may profitably be added, a little Bole-Armoniack to ſtop the flux of Humors. Howbeit, inſtead of Treacle, Laudanum Opiatum, and other Narcoticks, may conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently be ſubſtituted.</p>
                     <p>After due Evacuations have been celebrated, and other things given inwardly which reſpect the antecedent Cauſe, we muſt proceed unto local Applications, ſuch as mitigate the pain, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs the contingent Cauſe: Which are not preſently to be uſed before the univerſal Remedies afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid have been firſt applied; for otherwiſe they are wont to do more hurt than good. For either the Matter which Nature intended to drive into the Joynts, is driven back into the inner parts of the Body, whereby grievous Symptomes are raiſed; or it is forced into the Joynts, and the pain is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated; or the part is effeminated, and made lax, and ſo the fluxion is encreaſed.</p>
                     <p>Which Cautions being commonly neglected, and external things untimely and heedleſly applyed; the Patients receive commonly more hurt than good thereby. And thoſe external Medicines do ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſpect the pain alone, or the Cauſe likewiſe of the pain, viz. The Humor which hath took its courſe into the part, and cauſed both the pain and Swelling.</p>
                     <p>Such things as mitigate pain, are very neceſſary in this caſe, becauſe the extremity thereof weakens the Patient, and draws the Humors to the parts affected. Furthermore, by the uſe of Anodines, the parts are relaxed, and the Humor which before did flow into the more deep parts about the Joynt, is diffuſed to the more ambient parts and external. Whence it is that the pains of the Gout are moſt vehement before the part ſwels; but after it is ſwollen they are mitigated. Now there are many A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodine, or Pain-charming Medicaments propounded by Authors to be applied to thoſe parts which are troubled with the Gout. But the chief are theſe which follow:</p>
                     <p>Luke-warm Milk applied to the part affected, by wetting Linnen Cloaths therein, and laying them on, doth aſſwage the pain; as alſo if the part be ſprinkled and bedewed therewith, eſpecially when it comes freſh from the Dug; which <hi>Amatus Luſitanus</hi> doth very much commend, in the 41. Cure of his ſixt Century, in theſe words: <hi>One mightily tormented with the Gout, cauſed a ſhee Goat to be brought into his Chamber, and her Milk to be milked out upon his pained Joynt; by which he perceived the pains evidently leſſened. And there is good reaſon for it: For Milk newly milked, doth aſſwage, mitigate, and leſſen pains.

                     <p>Of Milk likewiſe is made the Cataplaſm of white Bread Crums boyled therein, adding the Yolks of Eggs, and a little Saffron.</p>
                     <p>Alſo the Leaves of Henbane, or Violets, are boyled in Milk, or in Vinegar and Water, and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably laid upon the part affected.</p>
                     <p>Alſo a Cataplaſm is made of the Pap of Marſh-mallow Roots mingled with Milk.</p>

                        <pb n="537" facs="tcp:49088:238"/>Alſo a Cataplaſm is made of the Pulp of Caſſia alone, or mingled with Oyl of Roſes, or the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Ingredients:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Crums of white Bread boyled in Milk, half a pound: Pulp of Caſſia three ounces. Make them into a Pultiſs.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>the Pulp of Caſſia four ounces: new Venice Treacle half an ounce: Barley and Oaten meal, of each three ounces: the Crum of white Bread four ounces: Cows Milk two or three pints<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Boyl all into the form of a Pultiſs, which apply warm to the parts pained.

                     </p>
                     <p>In the beginning of the Gout, which ſeizes only the great Toe, lay on this following:</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Other Cataplaſms are likewiſe made of greateſt efficacy, compounded on this manner:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Water of white Mullein, and of Fern Root and Branch, of each half a pint: calcined Vitriol exquiſitely poudered, one ounce and an half: Meal four ounces: Saffron two drams. Make all into a Pultiſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Mallows, leaves and Roots, as much as you pleaſe, Boyl them in a new Earthen Veſſel, with equal parts of Wine and Vinegar, till a third part be conſumed; then ad as much courſe Rye Bran as will make it into a Pultiſs; which being well wrought together and ſpread upon a Linnen Cloth, let it be applied to the parts pained, as hot as the Patient can endure it. Solenander</hi> doth exceedingly commend this Pultiſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Foreſtus</hi> relates that a Cataplaſm made of Duck-weed and Chamomel Flowers boyled in Milk, adding a little Barley Meal, wil do miracles.</p>

                        <hi>Montagnana</hi> affirms this following to be moſt excellent in extream pains.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>the Yolks of ten Eggs; beat them in a Frying Pan with half a pound of Oyl of Roſes. Let them boyl gently till they grow thick, adding two drams of Saffron; and lay it on hot.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the beginning of the Flux, many lay on a Cataplaſm of Salt and Soot, wrought into a Body with whites of Eggs.</p>
                     <p>Or of two ounces of Chamomel Flowers: red Roſe Leaves one ounce and an half: Mullein flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers half an ounce: Pouder them, and boyl them in ſweet Milk to the ſtiffneſs of a Pultiſs, adding three or four Yolks of Egs.</p>

                     <p>Alſo divers Fomentations may be made to be applied to the place affected, after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:</p>

                     <p>Take <hi>Flowers of Mullein as much as you pleaſe; fill a glaſs Bottle therewith, and ſtop the mouth, and ſet it in the Sun; for ſo they will turn to Liquor, which being applied to the part affected, with Linnen, mitigates the pain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Salſaturni,</hi> that is, Salt of Lead diſſolved in ſubtil Spirit of Wine, eaſeth pains wonderfully.</p>
                     <p>Frog-ſpawn-Water ſtilled in <hi>May,</hi> applied to the parts pained, doth wonderfully aſſwage the pains, and tempers the Inflamation and redneſs of the part. Theſe following Simples may profitably be mingled therewith.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Frog-spawn-Water, Water of Tapſus Barbatus, or of Mullein, and of Fern, of each one pound and an half. Infuſe therein Lapis tutiae, and Litharge of Gold, of each two ounces: Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol calcined, and Allum, of each one ounce. Foment the pained Parts herewith warm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>An Infuſion of Litharge made in Vinegar, the Vinegar being a little evaporated, till it grow ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh, doth much good to an hot Gout.</p>
                     <p>Oyl of Calves Feet is excellent to allay the pains of the Gout, and it is thus prepared:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Let the Calves Feet be beaten, and the Bones broken, then boyl them all to a Pap. Take the Oyl which ſwims on the top of the Water, mingle it with Aqua vitae, and Salt, and therewith bath or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint the parts pained.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Alſo Oyls and Fats are by many uſed. But ſeeing the Inflamation which befals thoſe Members which are troubled with the Gout, doth draw very neer the Nature of an Eryſipelas, or red fiery ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, oftentimes thoſe fat things may do more hurt than good; for by ſtopping the pores, they may keep in the Humor, and ſo encreaſe the pain.</p>
                     <p>According as <hi>Sennertus</hi> makes relation of a man troubled with the Gout, who found great good by very new Sheeps-milk Cheeſe laid upon the pained part: for as ſoon as the Cheeſe being heated by
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:49088:239"/>
the pained part, began to melt and ſhed its Butter, the pains were encreaſed. Yet in ſome Bodies, Oyl of Roſes, and ſuch like, may do good, eſpecially mixed with other Medicaments; becauſe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the different Natures of Mens Bodies, ſeveral things do good to ſeveral perſons. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt be furniſhed with a mighty company of Medicaments, that upon al occaſions we may have change; becauſe there is ſcarce any one ſo effectual, as to do good to al that are troubled. Take theſe following for an Example or Pattern.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Crum of the whiteſt Manchet half a pound: Boyl it in new Milk to the conſiſtence of a Pultiſs; then ad of the Mucilage of Marſh-mallow ſeeds two ounces: Meal of Line ſeed and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nugreek ſeed, of each two drams: Flowers of Chamomel, and of Melilot poudered, of each one ounce: Saffron one dram: Oyl of Roſes one ounce: Mix all into a Cataplaſm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or to the Cataplaſm of white Bread Crum before deſcribed, Oyl of Roſes may be added.</p>
                     <p>Alſo Liniments and Oyntments are wont to be made to mitigate pain.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Yolks of Eggs two or three: diſſolve them with Oyl of Roſes, or Violets, or Wine, and apply them luke-warm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Balſamum Saturni</hi> prepared with Oyl of Roſes or Violets, allaies pain moſt effectually.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Ceruſs two ounces; diſſolve it in Endive Water and a little Vinegar make thereof a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid Oyntment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of the ſaid Ceruſs is made a Plaiſter of great efficacy which may be laid on in the beginning of the Diſeaſe, even whiles the Tumor and Inflamation is preſent. Its compoſition is thus.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Common Oyl one pound, Wine a pint and an half: Boyl them till half the Wine be conſumed. Then ad a pound of Ceruſs finely Poudered and two drams of Camphire. Boyl them to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of an Emplaiſter. When there is great Inflamation, Vinegar muſt be uſed inſtead of Wine. Spread this plaiſter upon Linnen Cloathes that it may the more commodiouſly be wrapped about the Parts affected.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A Living whelp laid to the pained Part, doth very much aſſwage the pain.</p>
                     <p>When the pain rages extreamly we may have recourſe to Narcoticks; howbeit they muſt not lie long upon the Part, becauſe they are adverſe unto the naturall heat and to the nerves.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Henbane Leaves two Handfuls: Nightſhade and Houſleek of each one Handful. Garden Poppy-Head one pugil, Mandrak Roots one ounce. Chamomel Flowers and violet Flowers of each one pugil, make a Decoction in Water or Milk with which let the Part be bathed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beat the reſidue after the Liquor is ſtrained out, and add of the Flower of Lin-Seed one ounce and an half. Wheat meal two ounces: Oyl of chamomel three ounces: and make a Pultis. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Spirit of Wine ſomwhat Yellow by infuſion of Saffron four ounces: camphire one ſcruple: Boyl them a little, then diſſolve therein, one dram of Opium: With that Liquor let the pained Part be bathed: It is a ſafe and moſt effectual Medicine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Green Tobacco Leaves beaten and laid on do eaſe the Gout, and are ſaid to be of a ſtupefactive Nature.</p>
                     <p>As for the Efficient Cauſe of the pain, to the Humor flowing into the Part repelling Medicaments muſt be oppoſed; and to that which is allready in, deriving and reſolving Medicaments muſt be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.</p>
                     <p>Howbeit repelling Medicines are diſallowed in this Caſe, eſpecially alone and without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of other things. For if they ſhal wholly ſtop the influx of the matter into the Parts affected, it is to be Feared leaſt they retiring to the inward Parts, ſhould cauſe dangerous diſeaſes, unleſs they happen to be tranſlated to ſome other Joynt. Again the Humor which hath already flowed into the Part, is the more driven inward, by which means, the Pains become more violent. But yet, if in the beginning of the Gout there be a great afflux of Humors eſpecially hot ones, which threatens ſharp Pains to follow, it will be convenient in ſome meaſure to repreſs the ſame, by applying repellers, not alone, but mixed with ſuch things as mitigate Pain, after univerſal and ſufficient Evacuations. For then ſuch things as do overmuch relax, do help forward the afflux of Humors. And therefore, we may ad unto the foreſaid cataplaſmes and other remedies Plantane, Lettice, Purſlane, Houſleek and ſuch like as alſo a little Vineger. As for example.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Barley Meal three ounces: Boyl it in Water and Vineger, add two Yolks of Eggs, Saffron twenty grains: Make all into a Pultis.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Red Roſes an Handful: Barley and Fenugreek Meal of each one ounce: Red Sanders one dram and an half: Chamomel Flowers one pugil: when they are Boyled and beaten, add two Yolks of Eggs, Vineger four ounces: Oyl of Roſes as much as ſhall ſuffice; make all into a Pultis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Among remedies which derive the Humor from the Part affected are Horſe-Leeches, after ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Evacuation applied thereunto: for then they do much good, eſpecially when the Veins in the Part affected, do ſeem diſtended and ſwelling with Blood.</p>
                     <p>Now reſolving Medicaments are wont to be uſed in divers forms as of Waters, Oyls, Unguents, Balſoms, Fomentations, Fumigations, Cataplaſmes, Plaiſters and the like, compounded after this manner.</p>

Take <hi>Vitriol white and green, of each one ounce: camphire two drams: aqua vitae and white Wine, of each one pint: Mix them and apply them with cloathes dipped in them.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Slake Lime in Urine, purifie the Liquor and foment the Pained place therewith It is likewiſe good if it be done with Vineger and Lime.</p>
                     <p>Martinus Rulandus in the Centuries of his Cures, doth mightily cry up his Gout-quelling Water, but never deſcribes the ſame. But Libavius, Petreus and others ſuppoſe it was thus made.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Fountain Water a Pint, Aqua fortis half an ounce: Sublimate one dram: Boyl them a quarter of an hour. Wet linnen cloaths in this Liquor and apply them luke-warm to the Part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <hi>Quercetanus</hi> in his <hi>Pharmacopoeia</hi> propounds theſe following.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Pickle of ſalt, and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rin of a Boy of each Equal Parts. Still them and Wet Linnen Cloathes in the Water and apply to the place affected, often changing the cloathes for freſh ones.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Green Elder Leaves and flowers of each one pound: beat them and ſteep them in Aqua vitae for two or three daies: ſtill them in a Glaſs or Copper veſſel, till they be dry.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Spirit of Wine rectified two pounds: of the fineſt honey one pound. Diſtill them in</hi> Balneo Vaporoſo: <hi>So you ſhall ſtill two Liquors; The firſt is watriſh; The ſecond much ſtronger, and Sulphureous, which you ſhall keep by it ſelf. To the remaining materialls add an ounce and an half of whol Oriental ſaffron: Venice turpentine two ounces: Caſtoreum ſix drams: Tartar calcined till it be white, half a pound; diſſolved ſalt an ounce: Phlegm of vitriol not ſeparate from its ſpirit four ounces, Lie made of Vinetree-Aſhes two pound: ſteep them together twenty four hours. Then ſtill them til they become dry: keep the Liquor which comes likewiſe by it ſelf. To the Dreggs remaining pour on the former Water which you kept: Steep them and ſtill them. Laſtly put all the diſtilled Waters together and diſtill them in</hi> Balneo Vaporoſo.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quercetanus</hi> ſaies, That this Water is of wondrous efficacy, and that it was communicated unto him by a certain moſt famous German, as a ſpecial guift, affirming, that this was the very Water of <hi>Rulandus.</hi> And he averred that he had ſeen the rare effects thereof in eaſing the Pains of the Gout, if Linnen cloathes being moderately warmed and dipped therein, be applied to the Part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,</p>
                     <p>The ſame <hi>Quercetanus</hi> in his Councel touching the Gout, doth brag that he reſerves to himſelf his Gout-quelling Water, as a Maſter-peice for ſuch an old ſoldier as himſelf to boaſt of which he ſaies is made of plain Fountaine Water, wherein he doth divers times quench certain Metallick ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which are wont to be taken inwardly when rightly prepared: whoſe ſpirits being impreſſed into the foreſaid Water, do contribute thereunto the power of penetrating unto the Roots of the Diſeaſe, and of truly reſolving the Tartarous, ſtony matters, with the ſalts, which are combined in the Joynts, from whence ſuch intollerable Pains do ariſe.</p>
                     <p>Peradventure this that follows it not unlike it, nor a whit inferior in Virtue.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſlaked Lime four pound: Slak it in River-water as much as you pleaſe, and let it ſtand in a Wine Cellar three daies, that the Salt may be better extracted out of the Chalk or Lime. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward let them Boyl a little and ſtrain the Liquor through an Hippocras Bag. In twenty pints: of the ſtrained Liquor, quench ſeven or nine times; firſt Plates of ſteel red hot; &amp; then Plates of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per red hot; and thirdly to the quantity of ten ounces of Vitriol calcined till it be white; fourthly Antimony melted in a Crucible to half a pound; fifthly Litharge or Ceruſe heated in a Crucible, half a pound; white Precipitate once waſhed and no more one ounce and an half. Braſsburnt and finely Poudered, half an ounce: After the quenching of theſe mineralls, let the water ſtand ſtill in a Wine Cellar, the ſpace of ten daies. Afterward, Boyl it a little, and ſtrain it through an Hippocras Bag. In this Water being hot, doubled cloathes muſt de dipt and frequently applied to the Gouty Part.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Among Fomentations eaſie to make, that is commended, which is made of Salt Ammoniack ſeven times ſublimed, and fitly diſſolved in Wine or Water. or of the Urin of a young man in good health, Boyled till half be conſumed and laid on with Raggs;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Solenander</hi> Writes in his 24. Counſel, Section the 4. That a certain Gouty old man was wont to make himſelf this Medicine. When the ſwelling and Pain was great and the place red, he took Salt, the Urin of a Boy and Vinegar. In theſe being mingled together, he Wet a Linnen cloath and ſqueeſed it and laid it on, this he did divers times and ſo the Pain was much abated,</p>
                     <p>As we ſaid before, that Anodine or Pain-quelling Oyls did little good in the Gout, the ſame muſt here be ſaid of reſolving Oyls, beeauſe they cloſe the pores of the skin and ſo hinder the freedom of tranſpiration and encreaſe the heat, neither can they by reaſon of their clammy ſubſtance peirce into the innermoſt Parts of the Joint, ſo to temper and reſolve the Salt, ſharp and Tartarous Humors which lurk in them, Yet if the foreſaid Oyls ſhall be Diſtilled in a Retort, they will become very fit for this uſe, becauſe they will be very ſearching and no waies clammy. Among theſe the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent are Oyl of Cheiry, Saint Johns Wort and of the Yolks of Eggs, which being mixed together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <pb n="540" facs="tcp:49088:241"/>
and ſtilled by a retort, are very profitable to eaſe Pain and to diſcuſs the Cauſe thereof.</p>
                     <p>Alſo <hi>Mathiolus</hi> his Oyl of Scorpions ſtilled after the manner aforeſaid, is moſt excellent.</p>
                     <p>Oyl of Wax is likewiſe effectual to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>But Oyl of Mans Bones made after the ſame manner that Oyl of Tiles is made, is preferred before all others, and commended not only by the Chymiſts, but alſo by the Dogmatical Doctors, as <hi>Crato, Platerus,</hi> and others. The manner of making it is this: Mans Bones freſh and unburied, are broken and burnt, and caſt into old Oyl: afterward, they being full of the Oyl, are beaten and caſt into a Retort, and ſo by the force of the fire, an Oyl is drawn out.</p>
                     <p>Where Mans Bones are not to be had, the Bones of other Animals may ſerve the turn.</p>
                     <p>This following wil alſo be very good:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Maſtich, Frankinſence, Mirrh, Ammoniacum, Opopanax, Bdellium, Mummy, of each two ounces: Vitriol one pound: Honey two pound: Tartar one ounce and an half: Spirit of Wine four pound. Diſtil out of all an Oyl, with which let the pained part be anointed with a feather.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To eaſe the pain, and to reſolve the Matter of the Gout, a Liquor made of Snails is likewiſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, which is thus compounded:</p>
                     <p>Put an handful of Snails into an Hippocras Bag, and caſt upon them an handful of common Salt; upon the Salt, a handful of Dwarf-Elder, or Danewort ſeeds very finely poudered: And ſo one Lay after another of Snails, Salt, and Seeds, until you have made four or five Lay's of every one in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. Let the Bag hang in a moiſt Celler; and after a few daies there will drop a ſlippery Liquor and fat; which ſet in the Sun for four daies, and then ſmear the place affected therewith.</p>
                     <p>A reſolving Unguent may be made after this manner:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Chamepitys, common Wormwood, and Roſemary tops, of each a handful: Chamomel flowers, Melilot flowers, and Roſe Leaves, of each one pugil: Oyl and Wine, of each half a pound: Let them boyl till the Wine be conſumed: the Liquor being ſtrained, add thereto as much Wax as ſhall ſuffice to make it into an Oyntment. Let the Part affected be anointed herewith warm; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in twenty four hours the Part doth ſwell, and the pain ceaſeth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Alſo divers Pultiſſes reſolving and eaſing pain, may be made. The principal are theſe:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Wheaten Bran a pound: Salt one ounce: Soap as much as ſhall ſuffice. Boyl all into a Cataplaſm, or Pultiſs.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Bean Meal half a pound: Boyl it in a ſufficient quantity of Wine, adding thereto a little Aqua vitae and Butter. Make it into a Pultiſs.</hi> Or</p>
                     <p>The Leaves of Dwarf-Elder, or Tree-Elder being beaten, may be applied; or they may be fryed with Butter in a Frying-Pan like a Pan-cake.</p>
                     <p>Briony Root bruiſed with Aqua vitae, is alſo very effectual.</p>
                     <p>Alſo ſome commend Aron, Cuckoo-pintle, or Prieſts-pintle Roots, being mingled with Cow-dung.</p>
                     <p>This following is commended by <hi>Solenander,</hi> becauſe it reſolves without any great heating, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the pain, and ſtrengthens the Joynts. And it may be ſafely applied after the beginning of the fit, about the fift day of the Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Pouder of red Roſes two ounces: Maſtich one ounce: Camphire half a dram: Barley meal half a pound. Boyl all in white Wine, evermore ſtirring the ſame, till it come to be thick, and lay it on warm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Emplaſters are likwiſe wont to be of great uſe in this Caſe. The chief are theſe which follow.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take Frankinceſe, Mummy, Colophony, of each one ounce: Maſtich, Mirrh, white Coral, of each half an ounce: Mans Fat ſix drams: Gum Ammoniacum, and Bdellium diſſolved in Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, of each three Drams: Turpentine half an ounce: Oyl of Foxes, and of Roſes, of each as much as ſhall ſuffice to make all into a Plaiſter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Florentine Orice Roots, and Hermodactils poudered, of each ſix drams:</hi> Emplaſtrum Oxycroceum, &amp; de Mucilaginibus, <hi>of each two ounces: Rozin of Pine one ounce. Melt them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, adding Oyl of worms as much as ſhall ſuffice, and make thereof a Plaiſter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Emplaſtrum Diapalma,</hi> or <hi>Diacalciteos,</hi> is very much uſed, both alone, or with Camphire added thereunto, after this manner:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of the Rowl of Diapalma Plaiſter half a pound: Camphire two drams. Mix them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and apply them to the parts affected.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or in Form of a Cerecloth.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of the Rowl of Diacalciteos Plaiſter half a pound: Plaiſter of Sulphur an ounce: Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax and Benzoin, of each half an ounce: Tacamahacca two ounces: Oyl of St. Johns wort, and Worms, of each an ounce: Liquid Storax an ounce and an half: New Wax, as much as ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Melt all together, and dip your cloth therein, twice or thrice, make it ſmooth and dry, and keep it for your uſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="541" facs="tcp:49088:241"/>But yet the ſame Plaiſter mingled with theſe things following, ought to be reckoned amongſt the moſt excellent Medicines for the Gout.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Diacalciteos Plaiſter diſſolved in harſh red Wine, and boyled till the Wine be conſumed, one pound: Myrtles, red Roſes, Maſtich, Tartar of red Wine poudered, of each two drams: Chame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitys, or Ground-pine, and right ſweet Chamomel poudered, of each half a dram. Make of all a Plaiſter, to be applied after the ſwelling is much abated.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And at laſt, in a very old and ſetled pain, eſpecially from a cold Cauſe, ſome lay Veſicatories to raiſe Bliſters upon the parts affected. <hi>Sennertus</hi> makes mention of them, but ſo as that Anodines be mixed with them. But the moſt wiſe <hi>Varandaeus,</hi> my Maſter, did with happy ſucceſs uſe the common Veſicatory Plaiſter, which is kept in our Shops, ſimply, and by it ſelf without any mixture; wherewith he cured a great and rebellious Swelling upon the Knee, when other Phyſitians had in vain uſed many Purgations, a Sudorofick Diet-Drink, and many External Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines.</p>
                     <p>In the uſe of all the fore-recited Medicaments, this one thing is diligently to be noted, That we muſt take our hints from ſuch things as we find do help or harm the Patient: foraſmuch as the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Men are divers, their Complexions divers, and divers kinds of Excrements are bred in ſeveral Men, whence it is that the ſame Diſeaſes do extreamly differ in ſeveral perſons: therefore what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits one man, doth another no good at all; which often comes to paſs in curing the Gout. And for this Cauſe, every Practitioner muſt have an abundance of Medicines, that when one hath been appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in vain, he may uſe another and another, making alwaies choyce of ſuch as a rational Method ſhall moſt approve of.</p>
                     <p>When the Gout becomes ſtony and knotty, it is extreamly hard to cure, eſpecially if it be of long ſtanding. But new knobs may with Emollient and Reſolving Foments, Unguents, and Plaiſters, be diſſolved. The moſt Specifick or Appropriate, are theſe which follow.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Galen</hi> exceedingly commends a Plaiſter compounded of old ſtrong Cheeſe, made into a Plaiſter with the Decoction of a poudered Sows peſtle or Leg.</p>
                     <p>Others boyl poudered Sows Legs, till they come to a ſlimy ſubſtance or Gelly. Afterwards they mingle therewith two parts of old Cheeſe, pouder of Water-creſſes one part, and ſo make a Plaiſter thereof. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Juyce of Tobacco three ounces: yellow Wax two ounces: Rozin of the Line-tree an ounce and an half: Turpentine one ounce: Oyl of Chamomel as much as ſhall ſuffice. Make all into a ſoft Cerate or Plaiſter.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of thoſe Eaſtern Berries, which the French call</hi> Coques de Levant, <hi>and Mirrh, of each half a pound. Pouder them, and mix them together with ſtrong Vinegar into the form of a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Gum Ammoniacum diſſolved in Vinegar, doth powerfully ſoften.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rulandus</hi> anoints thoſe hard Swellings in the morning, at noon, and in the Evening with Oyl or Balſom of Sulphur hot, and then he laies on a Plaiſter hot, of <hi>Emplaſtrum Diaſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But this Plaiſter following, is your rare Plaiſter, becauſe beſides eaſing the pain, it draws the grit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſtnoy ſubſtance out of the Joynts likewiſe.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Roman Vitriol one pound: Roch Allum half a pound: Salt four ounces. Calcine all theſe together in a Crucible or Earthen pot, letting it to ſteem ſo long till the ſpirits ſhall begin to go away. Which when you perceive by their ſmel to riſe, leave preſently your calcining, and let all cool, and then pouder them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of this Pouder, and Barley Meal, of each a like quantity; mingle them with Wine Lees to the form of a Pultiſs, which ſpread upon a rag as thick as a knife, and apply to the place affected. When it is dried, diſſolve it again with Lees of Wine, and apply it again, until in the firſt place the pain be diſcuſſed; and in the next place, until all the ſtony ſubſtances be conſumed out of the knobbed and knotted Joynts. In the mean while it fals out often that the Skin will break, which need not affright us; for either afterwards the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers cloſe of their own accord, or at leaſt by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wax upon them in manner of a Plaiſter, they are cloſed up, the Joynts having regained their motion with activity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Finally, If the Gout be very exceeding old, and perfectly knotted, by the preceding Cure a miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of pain is to be hoped, but the ſtony ſubſtances wil hardly give way; therefore with a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Cauſtick the Skin is to be opened, and then the ſtones are to be taken away with a drawing Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Gums.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of the Gout when preſent, is performed by the Remedies aforeſaid. But becauſe this Diſeaſe is wont to return by fits, eſpecially in the Spring and Fall, we muſt now ſhew the way to prevent the ſame. Which Prevention ought to aim at the hindering of any Gouty Matter, like to fall into the Joynts, from gathering in the Body; or if any be collected, that it may be carried away.
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:49088:242"/>
And finally that the Joynts may not be ſo diſpoſed to receive the Humor which flows unto them. The collection of Matter will be hindred, by an excellent Diet, and by Medicines rectifying the diſtempers of the Bowels. The Matter collected will be carried away by Evacuating Medicaments. And the Joynts will not ſo eaſily receive if they be fortified with corroborating Medicaments.</p>
                     <p>As for the Matter of Diet, although in this Caſe it be of very great, yea greateſt moment, yet the Nature of this work will not give me leave to deſcribe the ſame.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall only ſpeak of the Patients Drink ſo as to ſay, that Wine is extream hurtful to all Gouty Perſons, and many have recovered only by abſtaining therefrom. Yet if the Patient in regard of ſome other Infirmity cannot wholly abſtain from Wine, let him drink weak Wine, or well allaied with Water. <hi>Hollerius</hi> inſtead of Wine commends thin Metheglin viz. Of forty or forty eight Parts of Water to one of Honey. Yet this ſuites not with ſuch as abound with bitter-choller and thoſe that are dry and thirſty.</p>
                     <p>This following Diet drink ſuits all Natures, and hath done much good to very many perſons.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Salſa parilla Roots two ounces: Liquoriſh one ounce: Cinnamon and Anniſe Seeds half an ounce: Make all into a very ſine Pouder. Of this Pouder mix one ſpoonful with ſo much ſmal Beer or ale as the Patient is wont to drink at a Meal. Brew them together out of one Pot into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other three or four times. Then ſtrain the Liquor for the Patients ordinary drink. Doing the like for every Meal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as for Evacuations, Bleeding muſt be firſt practiſed eſpecially in the ſpring and fall, in ſuch as abound with Blood and whoſe Blood is wont to work and ferment or be very hot.</p>
                     <p>But Purgation is not only to be uſed ſpring and fall, but four times in a yeer, yea and every month in every Cacochimical Body that is which abounds much with evil Humors. To which purpoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny forms of Purgations are handed to and fro, of a ſpecial property for this Diſeaſe. Theſe that follow are the chief, which are ſo to be uſed by the diſcreet Phyſitian, as that he muſt make many changes, both in reſpect of the materials and the Doſe, according to the various Conſtitutions of the Patients,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Senna clenſed, Turbith, Hermodactiles and Pouder of a Mans Skull that hath never been in the Earth of each one dram: Diagridium half a dram: Make all into a Pouder of which give one dram: at a time, in Groundpine Water, or in Broth.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Salſa parilla one ounce: Senna ſix drams: Turbith, Hermodactiles, Jalap, Mechoacan of each half an ounce: Agarick Trochiſcated two drams: Diagridium and Cinnamon of each half a dram: Make all into a Pouder. Steep a dram thereof in white Wine all night, in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning let the Patient drink Pouder and Wine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Electuarium Caryocoſtinum</hi> is by Petrus Bagerus exceedingly commended, and is approved by al Practitioners, and it is deſcribed in the <hi>London Diſpenſatory</hi> in Folio 111. and in that of <hi>Bauderon.</hi> It is given to half an ounce: But in hot Conſtitutions it may do harm.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rhasis</hi> Commends his Pils ſo far as to ſay, that they can make ſuch as are fain to Ride, to go on Foot again. Thus they are made.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Aloes of the beſt half an ounce: Red Roſes two ſcruples: Hermodactiles white and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from their outmoſt Skin or ſhel, one dram and an half: Diagridium one dram: With Water of Ground-Pine and honey of Roſes make all into a Maſs of Pils. the doſe one dram.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe alſo are good which follow.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Aloes, Hermodactiles of each half an ounce: Groundpine, or Chamepitys two drams: Chamaedris or Germander, Stcoehados of each one dram: Saint Johns Wort Seeds, half a dram: With <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enice Turpentine make a Maſs of Pils, which becauſe they Purge little may be given the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tener.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Alſo Evacuation by Vomit is very good for Prevention if the Patient can bear it well; which is declared by Alſaharavius a famous Phyſitian in theſe words. <hi>A Vomit is better than a purg to Root out ſuch ill Humors of a groſs Nature as are below the Knee even to the Foot; as in the Knee-Gout, Sciatica and ſuch like.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now Vomiting may be procured every Month two daies together becauſe the ſecond day drives out the Reliques of the firſt. And ſome have obſerved that vomiting is more ſucceſsful than ordinary when is in a Sign that chews the Cud, ſuch as the Bul &amp; the Goat or Capricorn. It is good to Vomit the Moon after Supper the Patient having eaten divers Meats, Fat, ſharp of Salt or Spice &amp;c. and others in great Quantity, and afterward rubbing his ſtomach and putting his finger into his throat. And if that will not do, he muſt take a Vomit, eſpecially of Aſarum and Broom Boiled together and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction drunk, which are otherwiſe good in the Cure of the Gout,</p>
                     <p>That Evacuation likewiſe which is made by ſweat, Purges the Blood from wheyiſh excrements, and draws out the antecedent Cauſe of the Gout. To this Purpoſe a Sudorofick Diet drink may be ordered for the Patient Spring and Fall, of a Decoction of Salſaparilla, China, Saſſaſras, or of Guaiacum, as the temper of the Patient ſhall adviſe,</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="543" facs="tcp:49088:242"/>But ſome late Phyſitians have brought into uſe, a Decoction which carrieth away the Matter meerly by inviſible Tranſpiration through the Pores of the Skin, without any ſweat at all, which hath done a world of good. Its Compoſition and uſe is thus:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Sarſaparilla, Crude Antimony, Nut-ſhels, of each ſix ounces: China Root one ounce: A little Braſil Wood: Water nine pints: Boyl them to four pints and an half. Let the Antimony and Nutſhels be poudered and tied in a cloth, which muſt be ſo hanged in the pot that it touch not the bottom. Let him take a good draught of the ſtrained Liquor, on mornings three hours before dinner; in the afternoon four hours after dinner, and three hours after ſupper, for fifteen daies together. Bleeding and univerſal Purgation being premiſed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of the Grounds remaining in the Strainer with like quantity of Water, may be made a Diet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>Drink for ordinary uſe inſtead of Beer. Boyl the Water half away, and ad Coriander and Liquoris as much as ſhall ſuffice to give it a good ſmack.</p>
                     <p>To prevent the Gout, and to root the ſame out of the Bowels, ſome Practitioners commend the uſe of Gout-quellers given an whol yeer together, whereby they avouch many have been perfectly cured. Among many of their Receipts, this is the Principal.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Salſaparilla four ounces: St. Johns-wort ſeeds, Groundpine, and Germander Leaves, of each three ounces: round Birthwort ſix drams: Angelica three drams: Cinnamon three drams: Cloves four ſcruples: Saffron two ſcruples. Let all be finely poudered and incorporated with Spaniſh Honey clarified as much as ſhall ſuffice. Make all into an Electuary, which let the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent uſe a yeer together, taking every day in the Spring, Fall, and Winter, one dram and an half; in the Summer only one dram. Let the Patient forbear to take it in the Dog-daies. Let him whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abſtain from Wine and Lechery.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Peradventure the Decoction of Germander may be of the Nature of the Gout-quelling Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments our Practitioners talk of; which was therefore commended to the Emperor <hi>Charls</hi> the Fifth exceedingly by the Phyſitians of <hi>Genoa;</hi> and <hi>Solenander</hi> doth teſtifie, That very many who drank this Medicine threeſcore daies together, were perfectly cured. The Compoſition of this Decoction is thus:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Germander gathered when it flowers, and well preſerved, one handful: Ripe Wine not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrong, nor very ſmal, three pints: Boyl them in a double veſſel five hours. Let the Patient take a draught of the ſtrained Wine, and compoſe himſelf to ſweat. This is to be done after the Patient hath been purged.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And it is here to be noted touching thoſe hot Medicines, that they are not only unprofitable for hot Conſtitutions, but they cauſe ſuch Reſolutions of Humors or Joynts, or other inconveniences, as can never be cured, and therefore they muſt be given with great Caution.</p>
                     <p>Peradventure this following Electuary may be uſed with more ſafety and ſucceſs, which doth purge the Body by little and little from all ſuperfluities without heating the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Senna half an ounce: Turbith, Hermodactils, of each ſix drams: Lignum Guajacum, Saſſapbras, and Salſaparilla, of each half an ounce: China Roots one ounce and an half: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phritick Wood two ounces: the three Sanders, of each one ounce: Annis Seed two drams: Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney very well clarified fourteen ounces: make all into an Electuary. The Doſe is one dram every day in the whol yeer, except the Dog-daies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Among the common People, ſome hold it for a great Preſervative from the Gout, to ſwallow three Cloves of Garlick whol every morning for a month together. For they heat and ſtrengthen the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, without heating the Liver, or other Bowels; for they are voided forth with the Excrements whol, but boyled and wrapped in clammy Flegm, which they bring from the Stomach and Guts.</p>
                     <p>In the Gout proceeding of Chollerick Humors, Waters of Medicinal Wels, which are Acid, Vitrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and cooling, ſuch as that of <hi>Tunbridg</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> Blackbois not far from <hi>Lewes</hi> in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> one in the Pariſh of <hi>Sandherſt</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> do very much good. So that by the uſe of ſuch Waters, ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have been for a long time freed from the Gout.</p>
                     <p>To the ſame purpoſe <hi>Hippocrates</hi> commends in his Book of Diſeaſes, the uſe of Aſſes Milk, which Experience ſhews hath done good to many Gouty perſons.</p>
                     <p>And in a word, All things which are good againſt an hot diſtemper of the Liver, and to ſtrengthen that Bowel, wil be good in this Caſe, as they are deſcribed before in the Cure of the hot diſtemper of the Liver.</p>
                     <p>But if a wheyiſh Humor flowing from the Brain be Cauſe of this Diſeaſe, as moſt commonly falls out, the greateſt care muſt be had of the Brain; viz. That its diſtemper may be corrected, and that the Humors bred therein may be derived and diſcuſſed. To which intents; Iſſues, Veſica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, Medicines to be drawn up into the Noſe, Maſticatories, Pouders, Spiced Caps, will be very ſerviceable; and other Remedies propounded in the Cure of Diſeaſes of the Brain.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="544" facs="tcp:49088:243"/>The laſt Point of Prevention, is to ſtrengthen the Joynts that they may not ſo eaſily receive the the Humor flowing in. Yet it is to be noted, that ſtrengthening Medicaments, are not only Vain but hurtfull alſo, unleſs the antecedent Cauſe, and the Humor ready to flow into the Part, be carefully removed by the foreſaid Medicaments. Otherwiſe thoſe ſtrengtheners, either are not able to hinder the influx of the Humors into the Joynt: or if they do hinder the ſame, the Humors retire to the more noble Parts of the Body and raiſe much worſe Diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>Among the principal ſtrengtheners the preſſings of Grapes viz. their Seeds &amp;c. are reckoned, which diſcuſs the reliques of the Morbiſick Matter by their actual heat, and by their aſtringency, do very much ſtrengthen the Parts. <hi>Duretus</hi> upon <hi>Hollerius</hi> doth thus commend them. <hi>But the uſe of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ine-Grape Kernells doth exceedingly profit in the time of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>intage. If the preſſings of the Grapes be brought out of the Wine Preſs into a Barn and being covered with Blankets do there grow hot. In them let the Patient thruſt his Feet, Legs, Thighs, Arms, or his whol Body. I have tried it</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>an hundred times, there is no better thing under the Cope of Heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And <hi>Solenander</hi> in his Counſel 21. Sect. 4. Doth give the foreſaid Medicine this commendation. <hi>But among the beſt and ſafeſt remedies, (which do alſo ſtrengthen the Parts affected, and do cheriſh the innate heat,) is this to be reckoned, and diligently once every yeer (for oftner it cannot) to be practiced, viz. That in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>intage time, the Feet and hands affected, be whelmed in preſſings of Grapes hot from the preſs, or made hot with warm Wine, every Morning for fifteen daies. And I could name a worthy Perſonage, to whom I have communicated this Medicament, and received from him a very conſiderable Gratuity; therefore who could not go at all, and by this Medicine and Gods Bleſſing, he was reſtored. And by how much the Grapes are riper, by ſo much the more good, will the preſſings do in this Caſe.</hi>

                     <p>Sulphureous and Nitrous bathes ſuch as the Balerucane in <hi>France,</hi> do not only diſcuſs the Matter of the Gour, by provoking ſweat, as was ſaid before; but alſo by ſtrengthning the Joynts, they do much conduce to the Prevention thereof; as alſo being uſed by way of Embrocation, that is the Head being wet therewith or it being pumped upon the Heat, Cotton wet therein be at laſt laid on and made faſt. The mire of the ſaid Bathes applied to the weak Parts, doth likewiſe ſtrengthen them.</p>
                     <p>Where the benefit of Natural bathes cannot be had, the Feet may be waſhed and other Parts Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, with a Decoction of nerve Herbs, ſome aſtringents being added thereto, as Balauſtians, Mirtill. Cypreſs Nutts, Allum, and Salt, with Iron-quenched Water and red Wine.</p>
                     <p>Alſo Oyntments are commended, being frequently uſed, made after this manner.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Oyl of Mirtles or Roſes two ounces: Salt two drams: Mix them and make a Lini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Oyl of unripe Olives Oyl of Maſtick one ounce: Salt fried in a pan two drams: Bole Armoniack three drams: Dragons Blood, Hipociſtis, Frankinſence, Maſtich, of each one dram and an half: Let each Particular be firſt finely Poudered by it ſelf, then with the Oyls mix them into the form of an Oyntment.</hi>

                     <p>The Plaiſter called Emplaſtrum Diapalma is very good to ſtrengthen the Joynts: and its uſeful in all Gouts whatever the Humor be which offends. and <hi>Solenander</hi> writes in Counſel 25. Sect. 4. that he hath known ſome, who had wont to be often troubled with the Gout, and by the continual uſe of this Plaiſter, with frequent purges taken at certain diſtances of time, they were freed from thoſe Pains for five years together. And this Plaiſter doth not daub and foul, doth not raiſe Itch or Pim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, nor is it troubleſome by its ſmel or any other evil quality. And it is fitted to the ſhape of the member. When the Feet are troubled ſhoes are made of thin Leather which being ſmeared with this plaiſter are put upon the Feet. The like ſpread with this Plaſter may be applied to the Wriſts and other Parts. But the truth is the ſame Plaſter boy led in Wine and mingled with Pouder of Myrtles, Roſes, Tartar, Chamepitis or Groundpine and Chamomel, ſo as we deſcribed before in the Curation, is much better for the ſame uſes. And we have ſeen Gouty perſons, who contiually wore ſuch a Plaiſter upon their Feet and Wriſts, with moſt happy ſucceſs.</p>

                        <hi>Chap. 2.</hi> Of the Hip-Gout, or <hi>Sciatica.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THe Pain of the Sciatica or Hip-Gout, doth herein cheifly differ from other ſorts of the Gout, becauſe in thoſe the Pain poſſeſſes only the Joints; but this, it is not only in the Hip, but it holds the top of the Buttock alſo, the Loins and the <hi>Os ſacrum,</hi> and reaches into the Thigh and Leg even to the very Foot. Which comes to paſs by reaſon of Nerves ariſing out of the Loins and <hi>Os ſacrum,</hi> which are carried unto the Hip, and are from thence derived and ſpread unto the Thigh, the Leg and Feet.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſe of this Pain is the ſame which was propounded in other ſorts of the Gout.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="545" facs="tcp:49088:243"/>The knowledge of this Diſeaſe is taken from the Part affected: from whence it alſo took its name, for the Pain doth eſpecially affect the Region or Part of the Huckle-bone, for it hath this property, that no Humor, nor Inflamation or change of the color appears as is wont to be in other ſigns of the Gout: becauſe the flowing Humors do inſinuate themſelves into more profound or deep Parts, &amp; into ſuch as are larger, and covered with much fleſh, and they are not diffuſed into the ſurface of the body nor the very Skin as in other Gouts.</p>
                     <p>This peculiar Prediction belongs to the Hip-Gout, that if it continue long it puts the Hip out of Joynt: for a wheyiſh and flegmatick Humor doth inſinuate it ſelf into the Hollow of the Joynt which is very large, and if it bide there long, its thinner Part is diſcuſſed, the thick or remaining, which becomes ſnotty and ſoftens and looſeus the bands which knit together the bones which belong unto that Joynt; ſo that the Bone of the Hip falls from its Socket, whence follows Luxation, and thereupon limping or halting, and a Conſumption of the whol Thigh; becauſe the Bone being ſlipt out of its ſeat, doth preſs upon the Muſcles, Veins and Arteries, by which means motion is hindered and Blood and ſpirits cannot conveniently flow into the inferior Parts. The foreſaid Doctrine is confirmed by two Aphoriſmes of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> viz. The 59. of the 6. Section. Such whoſe Hip after long pains, ſlips out of Joynt and in again, they have Snotty excrements in that Part. and the 60. Aphoriſm of the ſame Section; Such as being troubled with long Pains of the Sciatica, come to have their Hip diſjointed, their Thigh Conſumes and they halt, except they be burnt.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of the Hip-Pain hath many things common with the other ſorts of Gouts; yet in many things it differs becauſe of the ſtructure and Largneſs of the Joynt; therefore it is to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the former Gouts, and to be handled in this Chapter by it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>And in the firſt place a Cliſter or Gentle Purgative being premiſed, the Vein of the Arme on the ſame ſide muſt be opened for revulſion ſake: afterward for derivation ſake, the Vena poplitis muſt be opened about the Knee, or that Vein near the outward Anckle-bone, which is called the Sciatica Vein, becauſe of the great good which the opening therefore is wont to do in this Diſeaſe; which alone being opened doth often heal this Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>It is wont to be opened on the Leg of the ſame ſide the Gout is on, yet hath it done much good being opened on the contrary ſide, and hath been ſeen ſuddenly to take the Pain quite away.</p>
                     <p>Galen <hi>in his Book of Blood-letting, Section 18. I remember</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that I have Cured divers troubled with the Sciatica in one day, opening a Vein in their Thighs; viz. the Cauſe being, not from cold, but fullneſs of thoſe Veins which are in the Hip; ſo that a Vein opened about the Ham or Knee, is more Proper and commodious in ſuch caſes, than in the Ankles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Alſo Blood drawn out of the Hemorrhoids by Leeches, doth wonderfully help thoſe that are Hip-Gouty, becauſe the Blood conteined in the Veins of the Hip is thereby drawn out: for there is the greateſt Conſent &amp; fellow-feeling that can be between theſe Parts by means of their Veins.</p>
                     <p>Strong Purgations are proper in this caſe; for lighter purges do rather precipitate the Humors into the Parts affected. And therefore the Arthritical Pouders are moſt convenient, Carpocoſtinum, Pils of Hermodactils and ſuch like. The Chimiſts do ſomtimes ſucceſſfully uſe Mercurial and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial purges in ſtrong Bodies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mercurius dulcis</hi> wich Scammony or other purgatives given frequently, doth powerfully eradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Humor cauſing this Hip-Gout.</p>
                     <p>Many preferr Vomiting Medicaments before purgatives, becauſe they Evacuate the Humors by a place more remote from the Part affected. <hi>Rondeletius</hi> prefers Alarum before other Vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories.</p>
                     <p>After ſufficient Purgation, we muſt proced to local Medicaments. And as for repelling Medicines, they are no waies convenient, becauſe it is to be feared leaſt the Humors be ſo much the more fixed into the Part affected; but at the beginning Reſolving things muſt be applied; firſt milder and leſs hot, leaſt they ſhould attract the Humors more into the Part affected; after ſuch as are more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in this manner.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Briony Roots two pounds: Dwarf-Elder Roots one pound: Juniper Berries half a pound: Leaves of Groundpine, Mint, Marjarom, Sage, Roſemary, flowers of Chamomel and Melilot of each four handfulls: Make a Decoction for a bath to ſit in, which let the Patient ſit in twice a day for two or three daies together. At the beginning the Decoction may be made of Water alone afterward in Water and White Wine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>With the ſame or like Decoction hot, may the Part Pained be fomented frequently.</p>
                     <p>Alſo Bags may be prepared of Salt, Millet and Bran fried with rich Canary in a frying Pan and laid on Warm.</p>
                     <p>Or, Bags very effectual may be made only of Juniper Berries beaten and fried in a Pan as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
                     <p>Alſo anointings will be convenient of Oyl of Chamomel, Oyl of Dill, Orice, Nard and Rue;
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:49088:244"/>
which by relaxing the exterior Parts, will draw the motion of the Humors to themwards, by which means the inner parts wil be leſs affected.</p>
                     <p>Oyl of Scorpions of <hi>Mathiolus</hi> anointed on, wil be very effectual.</p>
                     <p>To reſolve more powerfully, The <hi>Aqua Balſami Guidonis,</hi> being anointed on, wil be excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding good.</p>
                     <p>Oyntment of Marſh-mallows doth looſen the external parts, and doth gently diſcuſs the Morbiſick Matter; therefore towards the beginning, the whol Thigh may be anointed therewith, and the Legg to the Foot by a flaming fire.</p>
                     <p>In the Progreſs of the Diſeaſe, this following being hotter and ſtronger, may be uſed.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Oyl of Worms, Tiles, Turpentine, of each two ounces: Oyl of Foxes one ounce: Gum Ammoniack, and Sagapenum diſſolved in Aqua vitae, of each ſix drams: Fat Caſtoreum three drams: Euphorbium two drams: Wax as much as ſhall ſuffice. Make all into an Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Spaniſh Soap, or Caſtle Soap diſſolved in Spirit of Wine, is moſt excellent, ſmeared on by the fires ſide.</p>
                     <p>Oyl of Tiles or Bricks alone, being anointed hot, after ſix Cupping-Glaſſes have been faſtened upon the pained place, and about the ſame; and after the anointing, the place being covered with very hot Linnen Cloaths, hath in one day cured a very ſtubborn Sciatica.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lacuna</hi> in his Comments upon <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> doth commend the following Oyntment as won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>the Juyce of the Roots and Leaves of Dwarf-Elder, or Danewort, of each one ounce: Oyl of Chamomel ſix ounces: Boyl them to the conſumption of the Juyces. Then add Wax as much as ſhall ſuffice, and a few drops of Vinegar to make the vertue pierce. Make of all an Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A Cataplaſm of the Herb Iberis, wild Creſſes, or Sciatica Creſſes, is much commended by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, becauſe this Herb is very effectual in the Cure of this Diſeaſe. It may be made after this manner:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>of wild Creſſes four handfuls: boyl them in Wine, and beat them, adding thereto Meal of Lupines, Vetches, and of Beans, of each three drams: Pouder of dried Rue, Chamomel flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Coſtus Root, of each one dram: Oyl of Turpentine half an ounce: Oyl of Earth-worms as much as ſhal ſuffice. Make all into a Cataplaſm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Platerus</hi> witneſſeth that it hath done much good, when green Sage hath been put on an hollow hot Tile, and often ſtirred leſt it burn; and thus being half boyled and ſprinkled with Vinegar, and a Cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>th put about the Tile. and the ſame put under the Hips, the vapor thereof hath been received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the part affected.</p>
                     <p>Alſo a Loaf very hot out of the Oven, cut in the middle, ſprinkled with Aqua vitae, and laid on, wil be very helpful.</p>
                     <p>To draw the Morbifick Matter outwards, a Cupping-Glaſs is good, four times faſtened upon the higheſt part of the pained place, which appertains to <hi>Os ſacrum,</hi> without Scarrification.</p>
                     <p>To the ſame intent, eight or ten Leeches faſtened to the part affected do much help, which are allowed and approved of by <hi>Paulus</hi> and <hi>Aurelianus.</hi> And <hi>Zacutus Luſitanus</hi> ſaies that in ten hours ſpace he therewith took away the pain of the Sciatica, which no other Remedies could help.</p>
                     <p>Plaiſters are likewiſe frequently uſed, and in this Caſe may do much. But in the uſe of them, this is alwaies to be obſerved, as it hath been ſaid generally of the reſt; that at the firſt mild ones be applied, which if they do little good, we may ariſe to more vehement. Which order we will likewiſe obſerve in our ſetting down the making of ſuch Plaiſters.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Pitch uſed in Ships, two ounces: Brimſtone poudered very fine three drams: Maſtich two drams: Turpentine half an ounce. Mix them, and make of all a Plaiſter, adding as much Wax as ſhall be requiſite.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Ship-Pitch two ounces: Gum-Ammoniack, Bdellium diſſolved in Vinegar, of each one ounce: Live Brimſtone, Turbith, Hermodactils, of each half an ounce: Caſtoreum one dram: Turpentine a little: Wax as much as ſhall ſuffice. Make of all a Plaiſter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Gum Ammoniack, and Sagapenum diſſolved in Vinegar, and then thickened again, of each two ounces:</hi> Emplaſtrum Diachylon cum Gummis, <hi>one ounce and an half. Melt all together. Then add Cinnabaris, Cinoper or Minium, and burned Braſs, of each one ounce: Orpment and Verdegreece, of each two drams. Make all into a Maſs or Plaiſter. If it raiſe Bladders, lay a Linnen Cloth between the Plaiſter, and the part affected.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the Diſeaſe do pertinaciouſly continue, we muſt proceed to a Veſicatory, which doth draw out the Morbiſick Matter, being applied to the part affected. Wherefore a Bliſtering Plaiſter muſt
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:49088:244"/>
be laid on, either alone, or that it may work more gently, with ſome of the foreſaid, mingled in equal proportions, for ſo it may be endured upon the part a longer time. Or this following may be made freſh.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Ship-Pitch, Wax, white Pitch, of each one ounce and an half: Colophonia, Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, Maſtich, of each two drams: Euphorbium, Ladanum, Quick Sulphur, Opopanax, Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacum, Bdellium, Galbanum, Sagapenum, of each half an ounce: Storax, and Benjamin, of each two drams: Cantharides three drams: Galangal, Cloves, of each two drams: Liquid Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax, as much as ſhall ſuffice. Make all into a Plaiſter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In an old Diſeaſe, an Iſſue in the Leg on the pained ſide, doth derive the Matter away, and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cures the Diſeaſe. <hi>Zechius</hi> wil have it made in the outſide of the Leg. And if there be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpition of a Catarrh from the Brain, another muſt be made in the hinder part of the Head. For that hath ſomtimes cured an old Sciatica when nothing elſe would do it. And then likewiſe other Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, correcting the Brains diſtemper, muſt not be neglected.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Zacutus Luſitanus</hi> tels of his making an Iſſue behind the Ears with wonderful ſucceſs, when the Humor came from the Head. Of this he makes a peculiar ſtory, Obſervat. 160. Book 2.</p>
                     <p>During the whol Courſe of the Cure, frequent Clyſters are to be injected, that part of the Morbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick Matter may be derived unto the Guts. Alſo to diſcuſs the next and immediate Cauſe of the pain, this following hath ſomtimes been uſeful.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Rich Canary half a pint: Walnut Oyl, and Oyl of Rue, of each three ounces: Oyl of Turpentine half an ounce. Mix all, and make thereof a Clyſter, to be caſt in ſo often as the pain ſhall require.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this following Clyſter doth wonderfully draw the Humors from the part affected, in regard of its Neighborhood to the Guts.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Pulp of Coloquintida one dram: Lean Bran an handful: white Wine a pint and an half: Boyl all to a pint. Of the ſtrained Liquor make a Clyſter, and let the Patient keep it an hour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Hip-Gout is ſomtimes bred of Choller, and hot Humors, which is known when the pain is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſharp, and pricks the pains are greater every other day, the party is lean, the Conſtitution of Body Chollerick. Age youthful, Country and Seaſon hot, the pain is encreaſed by heating things, Chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick Diſeaſes have preceded, an hot Diet, and vehement Exerciſe; and then the Medicines muſt be fitted for Choller, and an hot diſtemper. Wherefore, Bleeding is good, Purgations of Choller, ſomtimes Lenitive, ſomtimes ſtrongly purging with Diagridium, that the Morbifick Matter may be brought forth; cooling Juleps, emollient Clyſters cooling, Milk, Bathing, and other Remedies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in an hot diſtemper of the Liver. Alwaies being careful to avoid things Opening, and to chuſe rather ſuch as do incraſſate or thicken, ſuch as we propounded for a thin and hot Rhewm.</p>
                     <p>The Pain being extream, ſome Narcoticks may be given, eſpecially Syrup of Poppies, whereby the pain is allaied, and the flux of Humors ſtopped, by the Humors being thickned.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Laudanum Opiatum</hi> is far more powerful, given to the quantity of three or four grains; which alſo diſſolved in a Clyſter of Broth or Milk, uſing a Purging Clyſter before it, doth often take away the pain in a moment.</p>
                     <p>The external Medicaments muſt be gentler, as Oyl of Lillies, Violets, Chamomel, and ſweet Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds: Pultiſſes, of Lettice, Nightſhade, Endive, Barley Meal, with the foreſaid Oyls; and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the declining of the Diſeaſe, Fomentations, Liniments, Milder Plaiſters, and leſs Heating.</p>
                     <p>The Matter Cauſing the Sciatica, comes ſomtimes to maturity, ſo as to make an Impoſthume. Which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſhews in the third Book of his Epidemicks in the Hiſtory of <hi>Eupolemus,</hi> who had ſuch an Impoſthume, which killed him with a Conſumption. If the Impoſthume be opened, there remains a filthy il conditioned Ulcer, which likewiſe pines the Patient away. Yet <hi>Zacutus Luſitanus</hi> glories, that he had often cured the Sciatica with an Ulcer, in Obſ. 126. Book 1. Which Obſervation ought to be read and diligently meditated upon.</p>

                     <p>AFter Gouty Diſeaſes properly ſo called, it is worth our while to treat of the Rhewmatick Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, becauſe of the likeneſs between theſe Diſeaſes, which verily is ſo great, that the general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Phyſitians, which know not the Nature of this Rhewmatiſin, are wont to call it the univerſal Gout. For in both Diſeaſes the Joynts are pained: but therein is the difference; In that in the Gout, only the Joynts are pained; But in this <hi>Rheumatiſmus,</hi> or Rheumatick Malady, not only the Joynts, but alſo the whol Body, viz. The middle ſpaces between the Joynts, namely, the
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:49088:245"/>
Muſcles and their Membranes, and eſpecially the Skins which cover the Bones, and the whol habit of the Body; yea verily, and ſomtimes the inward parts of the Body, as the Stomach, Womb, Lungs, are troubled with this Rheumatick Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>And although the Greeks cal a Catarrh by the name of <hi>Rheuma;</hi> yet this Rheumatiſm we ſpeak of, differs from a Catarrh, being indeed contained under the general term of Flux of Rheum, yet of a different Nature from that kind of Flux which is commonly called a Catarrh, which comes only from the Brain, and trouble no more than one or two parts; whereas this Diſeaſe we treat of, comes from the internal Bowels by the Veins and Arteries, and is ſhed into the whol Body.</p>

Fourthly, Becauſe there appear many tokens of abundant Seroſities in ſuch as are troubled with this Diſeaſe; Thin and abundant Urines beyond the Quantity of what they drink, and abundance of Wheyiſh Humors appearing in the Blood that is taken from them.</p>
                     <p>And although a wheyiſh Humor be the principal, and moſt frequent Cauſe of theſe Rheumatick <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="549" facs="tcp:49088:245"/>
Chap. 7. in theſe words. <hi>In pain Cauſed by winds, the extenſion of the part is encreaſed &amp; the heavineſs diminiſhed ſomtimes it is with pricking, &amp; ſomtimes with Corroſion; and in a flatuous Pain there is no Heavineſs. And ſomtimes there is a Change of the Pain from one place to another.</hi> Theſe are the words of Avicenna: unto which he Joyns theſe following, which ſeem to come nearer the deſcription of this Diſeaſe we treat of. <hi>And the wind is ſomtimes in the Coates and fibres of the Members, as in the Collick from wind; or in the Coats of the Muſcles and under the membranes, and upon the Bones, or in the Circumference of the Muſcles, between the ſoft fleſh and the Skin, or lurking in the Member it ſelf,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And if any ſhall object, that Diſeaſes ariſing from wind, do not endure ſo long, becauſe windy Vapours are ſoon diſcuſſed. We ſhall anſwer, that a wind conteined in the Parts Pained is eaſily diſcuſſed, whence comes often change of Pains from one Part to another; but there is a ſeminary in the Veins from whence winds may perpetually ariſe, &amp; afterwards be carried to the Parts aforeſaid. Now this Seminary of winds is a thick, viſcid Humor and flegmatick, which the Blood taken from them doth often teſtifie to be redundant in ſuch as are troubled with theſe Pains; it being frequently thick and clammy like Glew, in appearance like crude and putrid flegm.</p>
                     <p>The knowledg of this Diſeaſe may eaſily be learned out of what hath been ſaid: yet ſhall we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cource thereof a little more fully. Firſt therefore, the Parts affected with theſe Pains viz. the Muſcles and their Membrans, and the Membranes which infold the bones, do diſtinguiſh this Diſeaſe from all other. For allthough the Pains of the Lechers Pocks, do poſſeſs both the Joynts and the ſpaces between the Joynts, and ſpecially the membranes covering the bones; yet they differ herein, becauſe they do not ſo univerſally infeſt the whol Body, neither are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual night and day, for they vex the Party only in the nights and very little in the day time; neither do they hinder the Patients from their buſineſs commonly; whereas this Rheumatick Pain, doth Nail them to their Beds, ſo as they can hardly ſtirr themſelves; neither can thoſe that look to them, once ſo much as move without great trouble and encreaſe of their Torments. And finally other ſigns of the Whores Pox have preceded or are preſent, as Gonorrhea, the Whores Boil, Putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Privities and ſuch like.</p>
                     <p>Other ſymptomes alſo there are accompanying this Diſeaſe, which help much to the knowledg thereof. For if you lay your hand upon the Part pained, you feel a kind of ſharpneſs with Heat; commonly there is a Feaver Joyned therewith, but it is very ſmall; and ſome times there is none at all. The Blood which is taken away is evidently corrupted, thick and clammy like glew, and after many times bleeding, it is ful of wheyiſh moiſture, and ſo changed, that it hath not the appearance of Blood. When the Pain is quite gone or intermits there remains no weakneſs in the Part, as is uſuall in the Gout. Purging Medicaments at the beginning do no good, nor things outwardly applied to the Part affected; they do rather augment the Diſeaſe and the Pain: but when the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe begins to decline, both are profitable.</p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſtick, this Diſeaſe is ſeldom or never deadly, but is very troubleſome to the Patient by its length: for it continues two or three months, if it be without a Feaver; nay verily; ſomtimes if it be not rightly cured, it continues for a yeer or yeers. <hi>Franciſcus Portus</hi> who in an elegant verſe writ ten Poems of Phyſick ſpeaking of this Diſeaſe relates that he was troubled with this Diſeaſe about two yeers ſpace, which at length he overcame by the earneſt Endeavous of ſix Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians of <hi>Paris,</hi> the moſt famous in their times, viz. <hi>Baſinus, Belly-Quercus, Sanjacoboeus, Seguinus</hi> and <hi>Hollerius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If this <hi>Rheumatiſus</hi> do begin with a Feaver, it is wont to be the ſhorter, but it torments the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient with more direful and cruel Pains: and then it finiſheth within twenty or forty daies, or at leaſt, it is much leſſened.</p>
                     <p>This Rheumatick Pain coming upon the Neck of other Diſeaſes as an Apoplexy or convulſion, doth make the Caſe leſs Dangerous, the morbifick matter being tranſlated from the internal Parts to the habit of the Body.</p>
                     <p>Sweates happening in the Declination of the Diſeaſe are good.</p>
                     <p>Thick and abundant Urins in the Declination, do bring an end to the Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>For the Cure of this Diſeaſe the Morbifick matter muſt be revelled, mitigated and Evacuated, the diſtemper of the Bowells muſt be corrected, and the ſtrength of all the Parts both the ſending and receiving muſt be maintained.</p>
                     <p>All which may be done by theſe following Remedies</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Leaves of Mallows, Violets, Betes, Lettice, Borrage, of each one Handful. Anis-Seeds two drams: Boil all to twelve ounces, in the ſtrained Liquor diſſolve Honey of Violets and Sweet Butter of each two ounces: Make thereof a Cliſter. Give it at a convenient Hour, and repeat every day, or every other day during the whol Courſe of the Diſeaſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When the Cliſter is come away open a Vein in either Arm and take away eight or nine ounces of Blood. It Matters not on which Arm the Vein be at firſt opened, becauſe Blood-letting muſt be
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:49088:246"/>
often repeated and the Veins of both Arms divers times opened. Blood muſt therefore be drawn every day from the beginning of the Diſeaſe til the Diſeaſe come to remit &amp; the Pains to leſſen neither mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters it though the Patient be let blood ten or twelve times one after another in ſo many daies, becauſe it is a peculiar property of this diſeaſe, that the Patients ſtrength is not diminiſhed by frequent bleeding, as in other Diſeaſes it is wont to fall out. My manner therefore is in theſe Diſeaſes when I appoint Bleeding ſo often, leaſt the freinds and attendants or the Patient ſhould be affrighted with ſo frequent Blood-letting, to ad this reſtriction, that Blood-letting be continued every day, til either the Pains be diminiſhed or the Patient much weakened. And ſeeing no weakneſs follows the continual uſe of this Evacuation the patients do willingly undergo the ſame, and are eaſily perſwaded to repeat the ſame. Now the condition of the Blood it is which makes this eaſie bearance, which in this Diſeaſe comes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies away very much corrupted. Experience ſhows how profitable this frequent Blood-letting is; for by the conſtant continuance thereof, the Diſeaſe which is wont (as was ſaid in the Prognoſtick) to be long, is often maſtered in a ſhort time. And experience ſhews that large Bleeding at the Noſe, if it happen to one that hath this Diſeaſe, it perſectly Cures that party, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſeemes to hint at this in Aphor 74. Sect. 4. <hi>Thoſe who are likely to have an Impoſtume about their Joynts, are freed from that danger, danger, if they void much thick and white <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rin, ſuch as in painfull Feavers, ſome begin to make upon the fourth day: and if with all their Noſe Bleeds, the Diſeaſe will very ſoon break.</hi> For the falling down of Humors into the Joynts tending to an Impoſtume, hath ſome Analagy with this Rheumatick Diſeaſe we treat of. Alſo the ſame <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſeems to propound a certain adumbration of this Diſeaſe in the ſecond of his Predictories, and aſcribes the cauſe thereof to the ſuppreſſion of ſome uſuall Hemorrhage or Bleeding, in theſe words. <hi>They who have Pains and ſwellings about their Joynts, which are all aied not as the Gout uſes to be, in ſuch you ſhall ſind their Bowells large, and a white ſettling in their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rin &amp;c.</hi> afterward he adds; now this Diſeaſe betides thoſe who in their Child-Hood and in their youth have been accuſtomed to Bleed at Noſe, which cuſtome hath left them.</p>
                     <p>Whiles theſe bleedings are Practiſed, Cliſters (as was before ſaid) muſt be given every day or every other day; alſo Juleps muſt be given, which have power to correct the diſtemper of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wells, and to mitigate the Acrimony and agitation of the Humors. To this intent Red poppy water is very profitable in this Diſeaſe it is to be given alone morning and Evening ſix ounces at a time, with Syrup of Lemmons and Pomegranates in form of a Julep; howbeit it is no leſs effectual alone without the Syrups.</p>
                     <p>For ordinary Drink let the Patient uſe a Ptiſan Drink of Barley, Graſs and Liquoris; or of the Decoction of Sorrel Roots, or of the tincture of Roſes: abſtaining from Wine which is the great <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ehiculum</hi> or Spreader of all Flowing Humors.</p>
                     <p>Purgation in the Beginning, Augment, and ſtate of this Diſeaſe doth no good at all; nay verily it doth hurt, for it ſets the Humors on running, and encreaſes the Pains; as it is wont to fall out in all inflammatory diſpoſitions. But in the Declination it is neceſſary and frequently to be Celebrated, and that with gentle Medicaments, that the evil Humors abounding in the whol body may be Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated by Degrees. To which purpoſe this following potion may be preſcribed.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Senna and Tamarinds of each half an ounce: Annis Seed and Cream of Tartar, of each one dram: Sorrell Leaves half a Handful. Boyl all to three ounces: In the ſtrained Liquor diſſolve Manna and Syrup of Roſes of each one ounce: Make a potion, to be iterated divers times, as the Phyſitian ſhall think ſit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the form of a Bole be more deſireable, it may thus be made;</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Caſſia new drawn ſix drams: Catholicum doubled three drams: Rhubarb in Pouder and Cream of Tartar of each one dram: with Sugar make a Bolus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If you would purge more effectually add to the potion or the Bole a ſcruple of Jallap.</p>
                     <p>If theſe Purgations ſhall not ſuffice to eradicate this Diſeaſe (which is often very rebellious) we muſt proceed to ſtronger Purgatives, as <hi>Electuarium Diephoenicon, Diaprunum Solutivum,</hi> and ſuch like provided there be no Feaver. I have all waies cured this Diſeaſe (when the foreſaid Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments could not do it) which <hi>Mercurius Dulcis</hi> ſix times ſublimed, being given divers times to the Quantiry of a ſcruple with ten graines of Scammony or Roſin of Jallap. An example of which kind of Cure is to be ſeen in my obſervations, viz. in Obſ. 41. Cent. 3. One only Cliſter of Vomiting Wine Cured this Diſeaſe in a certain Gentle Woman, as you have it in Obſ. 22. of the ſame Century.</p>
                     <p>Touching Sweat-Drivers, the ſame is to be ſaid which was ſaid of Purges; viz. that they in the Beginning, Augment and ſtate, do no good; nay do very much harm; which the common ſort of Practitioners find by experience, who being deluded with the likeneſs of a true Cararrh, and wearied with the ſtubbornneſs of the Diſeaſe, do flie to Sudoroſicks, by which the Diſeaſe is doubled and the Pains encreaſed. But in the Declination, after due Purgations, no Feavers being preſent, they may do much good, and they may be made of a Decoction of China, or Salſa-Parilla; or ſweat
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:49088:246"/>
may be procured in a Laconick Bath with ſpirit of Wine or ſome appropriate Decoction.</p>
                     <p>After ſufficient Evacuations; yea rather while they are celebrated, we muſt be careful to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the whol body and the principal Parts thereof; which Indication <hi>Galen</hi> in 1. of the Difference of Feavers Chap. 6. where he expounds the Nature of this Diſeaſe, ſaies, is to be preferred before all others, in theſe words. <hi>Juſtly therefore the aim of a Phyſitian in cureing theſe kind of Patients, is not Evacuation, but Roboration of the whol Body.</hi> Which is not ſo to be underſtood, as if no Evacuation were fit in theſe Caſes (for the ſame <hi>Galen</hi> begins the Cure of this Diſeaſe by Blood-let-ting) but that we muſt make more and more often uſe of ſtrengthened, and leſs and ſeldomer uſe of Evacuations. Yet ſure enough it is, that the Parts cannot be ſtrengthened, unleſs the ſuperfluity of Excrements, by which they are burthened be purged out.</p>
                     <p>Now theſe ſtrengtheners we ſpeak of, muſt be of a cooling Virtue; ſeeing (as was ſaid) the over hot diſtemper of the Liver gives beginning to this Diſeaſe. There is great plenty of ſuch Medicaments in Authours: Of theſe I ſhall propound four, which I account moſt effectuall and leaſt ingrateful to the Patient.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is the Tincture of Coralls, two ounces of which the ſick may take in a morning, two houres before Meat, every day on which no other Medicaments are adminiſtred.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe the Tincture of Coralls cannot long be kept, it is reduced into a Syrup for longer keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with Sugar, of which two ſpoonfulls may be taken in the morning: but the Efficacy thereof is much leſs, than of the ſimple Tincture.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond, is the Conſerve of the fruit which grows upon the Roſe-b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ar or the Eglantine Briar, which is moſt pleaſing to the taſte, cooles the Liver, and by a gentle a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>riction corroborates the ſame. The Patient may take thereof the Quantity of a Cheſtnut, morning and evening.</p>
                     <p>The third is the Electuary of <hi>Triaſantalon</hi> with a four-fold proportion of Rhubarb, made into Lozenges; two drams whereof the Patient may take every day and drink a little ordinary drink thereupon.</p>
                     <p>The fourth is A Tincture of Roſes, a Cup whereof the Patient muſt drink, once, twice, thrice a day far form Meals. It is thus made.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Red Roſe Leaves dried one ounce: Water, Blood Warm three Pints: ſpirit of Sulphur or Vitriol one dram and an half: infuſe them ſix hours: To the ſtramed Liquor ad white Sugar half a pound: keep it in a Glaſs for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The foreſaid Remedies or ſome of them muſt be uſed in Courſe one after another, leaſt Nature be too much accuſtomed to one, and ſo the leſs altered thereby,</p>
                     <p>When the Diſeaſe is Cured, the Patient muſt be cautious for a time leaſt new matter being col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected a Relapſe ſhould happen. The Prevention therefore hereof, wil chiefely conſiſt in a ſtate or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riodical Purgation, to be iterated once or twice every month; which may fitly be done by this Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial Syrup following, which will do more good by altering and ſtrengthening the Liver than by purging.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Juyces newly preſt and cleared by ſettling, out of Endive, Cichory, Egrimony, Fumitory, Hopps, and Bugloſs three pints: Juyce of Apples that are Odoriferous, as Permaines and Pipins, two pints, Senna ſix drams: Epithimum two ounces: Rhubarb elect, and Agarick newly trochiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated of each one ounce: Mace and Cloves of each half a dram: Infuſe and Boyl all according to Art, till there remain fifteen ounces of the Liquor, wherein diſſolve of white Sugar the ſame Quantity and make a Syrap perfectly boyled. Of with let the Patient take two ounces once or twice in a month, with Chick or Veal Broth, qualified with the Leaves of Borrage and Cetrach and Agrimony.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Allo ſpring and fal'twil be good to open a Vein.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, to temper the fervency of the Liver, a Bath of Luke-warm Water will be good, which muſt be frequently repeated, the whol Summer through: or for more Conveniency a Tub to ſit in may ſuffice.</p>
                     <p>To the ſame intent Conſerve of Bramble-Roſe or Eglantine Roſe-Berries will be good, or an Electuary of the ſame virtue, and Lozenges made of the Species <hi>Diatrion Santalon,</hi> being frequently uſed.</p>
                     <p>Hereunto muſt be added a good Diet of Meats affording good Juyce and eaſily digeſted, as Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges, Capons, Chickens and Pullets; eſpecially broths and the Juyces of fleſh preſſed forth, and ſuch like, all which muſt be taken in no great Quantity, that they may be more eaſily digeſted.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E find by many Authors great Volumns written touching the Theory and Cure of Feavers; in which, innumerable Controverſies, and difficult Diſputations are handled. Which as they are in the Schools very uſeful, yea, and neceſſary; ſo are they tedious to moſt Phyſitians, who having left the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities, do give themſelves unto the Practice of Phyſick: For they deſire a ſhort and cleer Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Theory of Diſeaſes, which may ſuffice to declare their Nature, Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and Signs, both Diagnoſtick and Prognoſtick, with their right Method of Curing, which is the only thing they regard.

                        </head>
                        <p>THis Feaver is commonly bred of external Cauſes, and of vehement Motions of Body and Mind, as Anger, Cares, Labor Pain, Watching, and Faſting, by which the Spirits are inflamed; alſo by Sleep and Sorrow, by which the hot Humors and Vapors are kept within the Body. Alſo by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heated with the Sun, Fire, or Stove, by which means, hot air being drawn in with the Breath, and received by the Pores of the Body, it doth inflame the Spirits. Alſo by Surfetting, Drunkenneſs, and eſpecially by over large taking in of Meats and Drinks, that are of an hot Nature, as Peppered Meats, and ſtroog Wines, by which more Vapors are raiſed than can exhale. Alſo by Retention of hot Excrements, and that not only of the Dung and Urine, but eſpecially of thoſe Sooty Vapors which are wont to paſs through the Pores of the Skin, if thoſe Pores be ſhut up with cold, an Allumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Bath, and ſuch like Cauſes.</p>
                        <p>Alſo this Ephemera Feaver is bred of internal Cauſes, as from a Bubo, and other Swellings of the Thighs or Arms, eſpecially whiles they break; from an hot fiery Swelling of the Extremities of the Body, when hot Matter ſhut up together in one certain place, doth offend the Heart, not by its pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction, but heat alone. Alſo by ſome ſmal Obſtruction of the Veſſels, by which means the ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty exhalations being retained do cauſe a Feaver; as is wont to happen in Diſtillations, when they ariſe in hot Natures, and a thick habit of Body.</p>
                        <p>This Feaver is known, both when ſome of the Cauſes ſpecified hath gone before; and alſo by a ſwift, frequent, and great Pulſe; breathing frequent and great, Headach and Heat; there is neither cold nor ſhaking, no ſence of wearineſs, nor want of Appetite. Yet may there be ſomtimes a ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering or ſhaking fit, namely, when the Feaver is occaſioned by the heat of the Sun, or by cold. Fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Patients Hand we find a mild and gentle heat; the Urine is concoct, like that of one in health, unleſs by ſome Obſtruction or Crudity it be changed. It is commonly terminated in the ſpace of twenty four hours, with an eaſie gentle Sweat; yet it reacheth ſomtimes unto the third day, which if it paſs it degenerates into a ſimple Synochus, a Putrid, or an Hectick Feaver.</p>
                        <p>For the Cure of this Feaver, the Ancients did chiefly uſe a bath of luke-warm Water, which they did alſo frequently uſe in their Health. But ſeeing it is in theſe times out of uſe, neither is it in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in the Cure of theſe Feavers. Neither is it counted ſafe, in regard of a Plethorick or Cacochy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Conſtitution of Body, Putrefaction, or flux of Rheum, which may be in ſuch bodies, or may be feared wil happen.</p>
                        <p>But this Feaver is better cured by a Cooling and Moiſtening Diet; as Barley Cream, Cooling Broths, Smal Drink and Sugar, common Ptiſan Drink, or Fountain Water with Syrup of Lemmons, Maiden-hair mixed there with.</p>
                        <p>But the Cure admits ſome variation, according to the Nature of the Cauſe. So if it ſpring from the Heat of the Sun or Air, a cooling Diet is good, and the Patient muſt be conveighed into a cool lodging; and Vinegar of Roſes muſt be applied to his Forehead, to the Temples and former part of the Head it ſelf, if there be pain, as commonly there is when the Feaver comes from the heat of the Sun.</p>
                        <p>If it come from being in the Cold, eſpecially if the Patient being hot with Exerciſe went preſently into the Cold, Sweat muſt be provoked, eſpecially towards the end of the Fit.</p>
                        <p>If it come from the Skins thickneſs and cloſing up of the pores, the ſame Cure muſt be uſed; and to both theſe Cauſes, ſmal Wine very well allaied with Water may be convenient, becauſe it opens the pores, and helps to ſweat.</p>
                        <p>If the Diſeaſe was cauſed by Labor, the Patient muſt reſt and be nouriſhed more liberally with Meat of eaſie Digeſtion. If from wearineſs, the Patient muſt be artificially rubbed. Tranquillity of mind, and cheerfulneſs, muſt be oppoſed to Anger; and Choller muſt be tempered with Meat and Drink of a cooling Nature. To Sadneſs, Recreation of the Mind is a Remedy, and the uſe of thin ſmal Wine. If the Feaver was cauſed by watching, let the Patient ſleep by application of things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient: If by faſting, let the Patient eat cooling Meats of good Juyce: If by over eating or drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, let the Patient abſtain from Meat and Drink, not omitting ſuch things as ſtrengthen the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, both inwardly given, and outwardly applied: alſo with an Emollient and Laxative Clyſter, part of the Crudities is to be taken away. If Putrefaction be feared, Vomit may be procured, or a Purge given. If the Feaver ariſe of Obſtructions, we muſt conſider whether the Patient be Pletho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick or Cacochymical, viz. Whether the whol Maſs of blood be over great, or only ſome bad Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors abound in the blood. If the Patient be too ful of blood, blood-letting muſt be adviſed; if evil Humors only abound, a Purge muſt be preſcribed. And if the Obſtruction wil not eaſily be removed, this Feaver changeth into ſome of the other ſorts of Feavers, whoſe Cures ſhal be deſcribed in their proper places.</p>

                        <p>THe Cauſes of the Feaver <hi>Ephemera</hi> aforeſaid, if they light upon a Plethorick Body, and thick skinned, they cauſe the Feaver <hi>Synochus Simplex.</hi> Yet may this Feaver ariſe only from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Blood ſtuffing the Veins, and yielding many Vapors more than can breath through the pores of the Skin.</p>
                        <p>This Feaver is known by a thick and ſwelling habit of Body, the color of the Body and Face is ruddy; the Head is pained with a ſtretching or diſtending kind of pain; the Patient is ſleepy, hath a beating in the Temples, is unquiet, hath a ſtraitneſs in the Cheſt with difficulty of breathing; the Pulſe is great, even, frequent, full; the Veins ſtrut with blood, whence a ſtretching kind of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs doth proceed; the Urine is thick, little differing in color from a Natural Urine, only ſomwhat redder; the heat is to ones hand mild, tempered with a ſteamy Vapor; the Feaver holds an even progreſs, for either it holds one and the ſame tenor, or it leſſens by degrees, or it encreaſeth equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, never remitting or ceaſing. Whence there are reckoned three Differences of this Feaver: For that which continually encreaſeth, is called <hi>Epacmaſtica;</hi> That which continually decreaſeth, is called <hi>Paracmaſtica;</hi> That which keeps one and the ſame tenor, is called <hi>Homotonos,</hi> or <hi>Acmaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.</hi> It laſts til the fourth day, and ſomtimes til the ſeventh; and then it is terminated by bleeding, or ſweating; and if it be further prolonged, it degenerates into <hi>Synochus Putrida.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Cure of this Feaver is performed, by blood-letting, by cooling, and by opening the pores of the Skin. <hi>Galen</hi> in the ninth Book of his Method, Chap. 4. cures this Feaver by two Remedies on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; viz. Letting of Blood til the Patient faint away; and by giving a great quantity of Water to the Patient to drink.</p>
                        <p>Blood-letting is abſolutely neceſſary in this Diſeaſe, becauſe it is bred by fulneſs of blood; and a Vein muſt preſently be opened at what hour ſoever the Phyſitian is called, unleſs the Patients Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach be ful of Meat, the digeſtion whereof muſt be expected for certain hours. And although Blood muſt be plentifully drawn, and <hi>Galen</hi> reports in the fore-cited place, That he cured the moſt of ſuch as had this Feaver, ſuddenly, by letting them bleed til they fainted away; which bleeding was attended by a looſneſs, vomiting of Choller, and plentiful Sweat. Yet in theſe daies of ours, that ſame large blood-letting is out of date; which is not without danger, ſeeing <hi>Galen</hi> himſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates in his Book of Curing by Phlebotomy, Chap. 12. That it beſel three Phyſitians, while they were practiſing this large Blood-letting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that inſtead of fainting away, their Patients died out-right. It is better therefore at ſeveral times to take away ſo much blood, as the Nature of the Diſeaſe doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily require.</p>
                        <p>Before Blood-letting, if the Patient be Coſtive, or the Guts abound with Crudities, an Emolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and Laxative Clyſter muſt be given.</p>
                        <p>As for the point of cold Water, <hi>Galen</hi> orders it to be given in ſo great quantity, that the Patient grow pale, tremble, and be cold all over; and ſo he ſaies, it extinguiſheth the fiery heat, it ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens the ſolid parts, and drives out unprofitable Humors by ſtool, by urine, and by ſweat. But he ſaies there muſt be many Cautions in the uſe thereof; viz. That it be given in the Vigor of the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the ſigns of Concoction appearing; that the Patient have been uſed to drink cold Water in time of health, have ſtrong bowels, and full of juyce, a fleſhy and wel-ſet Body; have a conſtant and vigorous ſtrength; be not full of thick and clammy Humors, have no tumor in any bowel, nor ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, throat, or ſinews weak. Otherwiſe, if theſe conditions be wanting, it is to be feared leſt the Patient fall into ſhortneſs of breath, Dropſie, Trembling, Convulſion, Lethargy, or ſome other grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Diſeaſe. This kind of Medicine is likewiſe grown out of date in our times, ſeeing it is hard to obſerve all thoſe conditions, and ſo many dangers attend the undue uſe thereof. For it is better to uſe other more ſafe Medicines which cool the whol Body, and the Blood; as Juleps, and opening Emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, Epithems, Liniments, and a Diet altogether cooling. Juleps are made of the Decoction of Barley, or Sorrel, or Cichory; or with Water of Cichory, Endive, Sorrel, Lettice, adding Syrup of Juyce of Cichory, Lemmons, Pomegranates, Vinegar, &amp;c. Whereunto alſo for the greater cooling and opening, may be added ſome drops of Spirit of Vitriol, or Sulphur. If the diſtilled Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſeem too crude or raw, let them boyl with a little Species Triaſantalon, or Diamargaritum fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidum.</p>
                        <p>Emulſions may be made after this manner:</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>ſweet Almonds blanched and ſteeped in Roſe Water, one ounce: the four greater cool Seeds, and Seeds of white Poppy, of each two drams. Beat them in a Marble Mortar, powring on by little and little, a pint and an half of Barley Water. In the ſtrained Liquor diſſolve Sugar of Roſes three ounces. Make an Emulſion of Almond Milk for three Doſes. Which will be conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and is to be preferred before Juleps, if there be want of Reſt.</hi>

                           <pb n="555" facs="tcp:49088:249"/>Epithems to be laid upon the Region of the Heart and Liver may be thus made:</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Water of Roſes, Bugloſs, and Lettice, of each three ounces: Vinegar of Roſes one ounce: Pouder of the Electuary Diamargaritum frigidum one dram and an half: Camphire ſix grains. Make an Epithem, lay it upon the Region of the Heart.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Water of Endive, Cichory, Sorrel, of each four ounces: Vinegar of Roſes an ounce and an half: the three Sanders two drams and an half. Make an Epithem for the Region of the Liver.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A cooling Oyntment may be anointed upon the Liver and Loyns, of Vinegar of Roſes, <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Roſatum, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum Refrigerans Galeni,</hi> or <hi>Ceratum Santalinum,</hi> waſhed in Vinegar, tempered with Water.</p>
                        <p>If the Diſeaſe ſeem to lengthen, after bleeding we muſt purge, leſt the wheyiſh and Chollerick Excrements putrefie, and thereby a putrid Feaver ariſe. But we muſt uſe ſuch Medicines as purge without heating and agitation of Humors, as Caſſia, Manna, Syrup of Roſes, Tamarinds, Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, and ſuch like.</p>
                        <p>Ad hereunto a convenient Diet, viz. Cooling, moiſtening, and thin, of Broths made with cooling Herbs, Prunes, and ſharp Apples boyled, and Panadaes.</p>
                        <p>Let the Patients Drink be, a Decoction of Barley, Water boyled, and Water with Bread boyled in it, or mixed with Syrups of Maiden-hair, or of Pomegranates.</p>

                           <hi>Chap. 3.</hi> Of an Hectick Feaver.</head>
                        <p>AN Hectick Feaver occupies the ſolid Parts of the Body, which conſtitute the Habit thereof, and are commonly called Spermatical, or fleſhy; in regard of which parts it is more fixed and roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted than other Feavers which are in the Spirits, or Humors. For which cauſe it is alſo termed Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, becauſe it is become Habitual, and can hardly be removed from its ſubject.</p>
                        <p>There are many Diviſions of this Feaver. For firſt of all, there is a Primary Hectick, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins of it ſelf; and another Secondary, which follows other Feavers. Secondly, an Hectick Feaver is ſimple and ſolitary, or joyned with a putrid Feaver. Thirdly, ſome Hecticks begin at the Heart; others from other Parts, as the Lungs, Liver, Spleen, Kidneys, Womb, and other Parts inflamed, ulcerated, corrupted, or poſſeſſed with ſome other grievous Diſeaſe. And this Feaver though it have its habitual ſeat in the Heart, and the whol Body; yet is it commonly termed Symptomatical, becauſe of its firſt Original which it hath from other parts.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Galen</hi> makes three Degrees of an Hectick Feaver. The firſt is the very beginning of an Hectick; in which the Body is hardly extenuated; yet the moiſt Humidity of the Body is inflamed, conſumes, and dries. The ſecond comprehends the Augment, and therein is an evident extenuation of the Body, the fleſhy and fat ſubſtance of the Body periſhing. The third contains the ſtate of the Diſeaſe, and its laſt age; for it never comes to a declination, becauſe therein, viz. in that degree it is incurable: for then the fibrous and membranous ſubſtance of the Body is conſumed, and the whol Body is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuated, that the Face of the Patient is like that deſcribed by <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> nothing but skin and bone. This laſt Degree is called <hi>Maraſmus,</hi> or rather <hi>Hectica Maraſmodes;</hi> becauſe in a true <hi>Maraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> cold is joyned with dryneſs.</p>
                        <p>The Cauſes of an Hectick Feaver are divided into an Internal, and External. To the External are referred, what ever Cauſes may occaſion any of the other Feavers, if the Action of Heating be continual and vehement, or the Patients Body be apt to entertain this kind of Feaver. Such are, the heat of the Sun, or of the Fire, vehement Exerciſe, Meats and Drinks that are heating, immoderate Evacuations, as in a Looſneſs and bloody-flux, vehement paſſions of Mind; and finally, faſting in a Chollerick Body that is hot and dry of Conſtitution; ſeeing <hi>Galen</hi> affirms, that thoſe Phyſitians that were wont to enjoyn their Patients to faſt three daies together, did bring Chollerick Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by that means into burning and hectick Feavers.</p>
                        <p>The Internal Cauſes are, burning and peſtilential Feavers, which do ſpeedily conſume the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of the Heart; alſo a long ſlack Feaver. Alſo ſome peculiar Diſeaſe of any of the bowels, as an Inflamation or Ulcer; or putrefaction of ſome Humor contained therein; or finally, the corruption of the Member it ſelf, which are wont to cauſe a lingring Feaver, and an hectick.</p>
                        <p>Of theſe Infirmities peculiarly poſſeſſing ſome certain Members of the Body, and cauſing an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick, we have Examples manifeſt enough. For, as for what concerns Inſlamations, <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith he ſaw a woman that by reaſon of an Inflamation in her Midrif, fel into an Hectick Feaver. And we dayly obſerve in the Conſumption of the Lungs, or <hi>Phthiſis,</hi> a complicated Hectick Feaver. The putrefaction of Humors contained in ſome bowel, fals out in great obſtructions, or cold ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. The corruption of ſome Member is often ſeen in the Lungs; ſomtimes in the Liver, in ſuch men as are given to Wine, and who uſe much hot Spices; for a certain filthy corrupt blood is bred in
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:49088:250"/>
their Liver, by which the ſubſtance thereof is corupted. <hi>Fernelius</hi> ſaies, he ſomtimes met with this kind of Feaver, and that it is a ſign thereof, when the Patients extreamly covet Wine; but abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate all kind of Fleſh.</p>
                        <p>A Simple Hectick Feaver is known, becauſe it is continual, without any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>its, allwaies alike, neither encreaſing nor decreaſing, ſave that it is ſomwhat augmented, an hour two or three after Meat. The heat under the ſhort Ribs, is at firſt laying on the hand mild, afterward ſharp, biting and dry. The Pulſe, is little, frequent and quick; the ſick perceive not any Feaver, they are lazy, and loath to ſtir, and when they ſtir it is with Pain, becauſe their ſtrength is in a languiſhing condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Their arteries are hotter than the Parts circumjacent, which may be preceived by the touch after the Patient hath waſhed in cold Water. The Urin is like that of one in health both in point of color and ſediment. In the progreſs of the Diſeaſe Oyly ſubſtance Swims on the top, and the ſediment is like to Meal, which is ſign that the ſubſtance of the Body doth melt,</p>
                        <p>More particularly, we may know not only the ſeveral degrees of an hectick, but foreſee it before it comes after this manner.</p>
                        <p>An hectick Feaver at hand, is known, if the cauſes have preceded; viz. if there have been a burning Feaver, in a body naturally hot, dry, and of a thin contexture, in an hot ſeaſon of weather, it is to be Feared, the Patient wil fal into an hectick, and ſuch remedies as may prevent the ſame are to be uſed.</p>
                        <p>The firſt degree of an Hectick Feaver if it be Joyned with a putrid Feaver, is very hardly known: if it be alone, not very eaſily. In the firſt day, there are al the ſignes of <hi>Febris Ephemera.</hi> In the ſecond, the dryneſs is augmented, not the heat. On the third day it repeats not, it is not evidently augmented nor diminiſhed. And at length one hour or two after Meat, the Heat ſeems ſomwhat encreaſed.</p>
                        <p>In the ſecond degree, the Patient perceives no Feaveriſhneſs, only ſome alterations after Meals. There is a manifeſt dryneſs, a ſmaller and ſwifter Pulſe, with a certain hardneſs.</p>
                        <p>The ſigns of the third degree are moſt manifeſt; the Eyes are hollow, dry and have dry excrements in them, the bones evidently ſtick out, the lively colour of the Face is extinguiſhed: the whol Skin is dry, the Midrif vehemently contracted, ſo that the Patients ſeem to have no Guts. Their Pulſe is perceived under the ſtomach, in all extenuated perſons.</p>
                        <p>And becauſe a putrid Feaver is many times coupled with an Hectick, they are both exactly to be diſtinguiſhed, becauſe it is of great moment in regard of the Cure, which in this caſe is very much differing. Now this coupling may be known by Comparing the ſigns of an Hectick propounded, with the ſigns of a putrid Feaver, which ſhall be hereafter deſcribed in their proper place.</p>
                        <p>The firſt degree of an Hectick Feaver is eaſily Cured, the third is incurable; the ſecond is of a middle Nature, and look how much the nearer it approaches to the firſt or third by ſo much is it eaſier or harder to be Cured. An Hectick Feaver happens moſt commonly from the eighteenth yeer to the thirty five, for in that Age the Heat is moſt intenſe, and ſooneſt conſumes the Body. But they who before this Age or a little after are taken with an Hectick Feaver, do more eaſily eſcape and are ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Cured perfectly; or by a palliative Cure their life is protracted a long time, eſpecially if they be Women.</p>
                        <p>For the Cure of this Diſeaſe, we muſt firſt conſider whether it depend upon any Diſeaſeof ſome particular Part or not: for then the Cure muſt be directed to that Diſeaſe: as alſo if it be ſingle or combined or complicated with a putrid Feaver. And in this caſe the putrid Feaver is firſt to be Cured by Bleeding, Purging, and by Opening Medicaments and ſuch as hinder putrefaction: the Hectick Feaver in the mean while not being neglected. But if the Hectick Feaver be ſingle and alone the Cure muſt be effected only with cooling, moiſtening and reſtaurative things; the matter of muſt be taken from Diet and Medicine.</p>
                        <p>Diet, here, as in all Chronick Diſeaſes, can do much; nay in this Diſeaſe it can do more than all Medicines. Therefore the Patients Diet muſt be by the Phyſitian exactly ordered, viz. That it may be directed ſo as to cool and moiſten the whol Body. If therefore the Air where the Patient is, be moderately cold or temperate, let him uſe the ſame; if not, let it be corrected, ſo as that it may cline to cold and moiſt. For this Reaſon <hi>Galen</hi> in the 10. of his Method Chap. 8. in the Summer when the Air is hot, orders the ſick to abide in a Room under the Ground, that is very cold and blown through with the Wind, open towards the North. By which Remedy alone, we have ſeen a man extreamely conſumed, reſtored within a month. Again the heat of the Air in the Patients Chamber muſt be altered, by cold Water being powred out of one veſſel into another, by the very noiſe whereof Sleepis cauſed; alſo by moiſtening the Pavement of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with cold Water Sprinckled thereupon, or by cooling Hearbs, oftentimes freſh ſtrowed therein: and by forbidding any number of people to come in, which among other things, doth likewiſe heat the Chamber. And <hi>Galen</hi> gives order that when the Air is coldeſt it ſhould be received by the ſick namly by drawing it in by the mouth, becauſe it exceedingly cools the heat of the heart; but it is not good for the Body of the ſick, leaſt it ſtop the pores of the Skin and hinder the breathing forth of
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:49088:250"/>
excrements. But <hi>Galen</hi> affirmes that the breathing in of the cool Air doth the Patients more good, than they can receive hurt, by the ſtopping of their pores, if that ſhould happen: but that may be hindered by warm cloathing of the Body. Yet it is to be obſerved, that if the Hectick Feaver ari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e from an Ulcer in the Lungs; that the cold Air is not good in that reſpect, but rather temperate, a little inclining to heat, and dry. For which Cauſe <hi>Galen</hi> ſent thoſe that had conſumptions of their Lungs to the Mount Tabias where the Air was more dry than ordinary.</p>
                        <p>The Meates of the Patient muſt be cooling and moiſtening and quickly nouriſhing, as Chicken-Broaths and Broaths of Hens, Capons, Veal, Kid, Wether Mutton; Yolks of Eggs, with French Barley, Lettice, Purſelane, Endive, Borrage, Sorrel; The fleſh of Calves, Kidds, Piggs, Phea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants, Partriches, Young Hares and ſuch like. Panadaes, Barly Cream, Water-Gruel, Rice-Pottage, with Sugar and a few Almonds or rather with the greater cooling Seeds. Boyled Meats are fitter than Roaſted which are ſooner Inflamed and turned to Choller; the boyled do more moiſten. But if the Patient be more delighted with Roaſt-Meats; they muſt be very moderately Roaſted, and tempered afterwards with Juyce of Lemmons, Citrons, Orenges, or of unripe Grapes, without Salt.</p>
                        <p>Fiſhes may be eaten, becauſe they cool and moiſten but ſuch as are taken out of ſtony places are to be preferred, and ſuch as have a tender friable fleſh, haunting the Sea or Pure Waters.</p>
                        <p>Among fruits, Apples are commended becauſe they breed cold Blood. alſo Pears are convenient, Damask Prunes, and French Prunes boiled in Sugar; alſo Raiſons clenſed, which being prepared after this following manner, do nouriſh the body without heating.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Raiſons of the Sun clenſed one Pound: Let them be tempered in endive, bugloſs and Roſe-Water and very diligently waſhed, that the Laxative power may be taken away. Afterward let them be lightly boyled in the ſame Waters, adding a little Sugar, wherewith let them be preſerved for uſe: let the Patients take of them in the mornings and allwaies after Meat.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And becauſe Perſons that are Hectical, have the Feaveriſh heat fixed in the ſolid Parts of their bodies, by which the Nutriment is eaſily and ſuddainly conſumed and diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ipated: therefore Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitioners are wont to preſcribe unto them, Meats ſolid and of a clammy ſubſtance, as the Feet of Living Creatures, The fleſh of Snails, Crabbs, Tortoiſes, and of Froggs. For ſeeing theſe ſorts, of fleſh are moiſt and clammy they eaſily adhere unto ſuch Parts of the body as want nouriſhments neither are they eaſily conſumed by the Feaveriſh heat: and ſo they hinder the drying up of the ſolid Parts of the body. Yet ſome do reject theſe Meats, becauſe hard of digeſtion and trouble<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>om to the ſtomach. But this difference is thus reconciled. In the beginning of an Hectick, while the digeſtive faculty is yet ſtrong, theſe thick and clammy nutriments are convenient: but in a confirmed Hectick they are not to be given becauſe hard to digeſt. Add hereunto, that they may be ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and qualified, as that they may eaſily be digeſted; as by being boyled to a gelly, or giving only what is ſtrained out of them being beaten into a maſh. Among other things the land Tortoiſes are mightily praiſed for an Hectick, not only for a ſingle Hectick, but when Joyned with a Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and they are prepared divers waies. For either they are boyled in Water till they are diſſolved then caſting away the ſhells, the fleſh is ſeparated from the bones and boyled again with Cichory, Sorrel, Borrage, French barley, and prunes in a ſingle Hectick: but in an Hectick of the Lungs it is Boiled with Bramble Leaves, Purſlain, and Plantan. Let the Patient drink the broath and eat the Fleſh twenty daies together. Or the Juyce is preſſed out of the Fleſh being beaten. Or little Loaves are made of the Fleſh of the Tortoiſes boiled in Barley Water, with ſweet Almonds, pine kernells, the cooling Seeds and Sugar. Which are lightly baked in an Oven and are given the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent at Dinner and Supper. They may be thus made.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>of the Fleſh of Land-Tortoiſe Boyled in Barly-Water four ounces: ſweet Almonds ſteeped in Roſe-water ſix ounces: Pine-Kernells ſo ſteeped two ounces, of the four greater cool Seeds, of each one ounce: Annis Seed not Poudered, but lightly baked in an Oven one dram and an half: Cinnamon two drams: Sugar diſſolved in Roſe-Water, to the Quantity of all the reſt. Make thereof little Morſells.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Inſtead of Tortoriſes the Fleſh of a Capon is uſed and of a Partridg, and March-Pane is made thereof, good to reſtore Hectick Perſons, after this Manner.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Pulpe of a Capon and Boyled Partridg of each three ounces, ſweet Almonds ſteaped in Roſe-Water four ounces: Pine-Kernells one ounce and an half: Seeds of white Poppy two drams: Gum Arabickand Traganth of each one dram and an half: Pearled Sugar Cakes two ounces: with a little Roſe-Water make a March-pane, and gild it with Gold.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To ſuch as have weak ſtomachs, Gellies, broaths, and Reſtorative ſtilled Waters are given. A Gelly may be made after this Manner.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>a choiſe Capon, a Knuckle of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eal, or a Wethers Thigh, two Calves Feet, or ſix Wethers Feet. Boyl all in fountan Water, till it be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>ufficiently waſted. Strain and ſqueeſe out the Juyce and Broath and take off the Fat. In the ſtrained Liquor diſſolve a pound of white Sugar, ſix whites of Eggs, a little ſaffron or Cinnamon. Stir them together let them Boyl lightly, and
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:49088:251"/>
ſtrain them through an Hippocras bag twice or thrice. At length put it into Porrengers, or other Veſſels in which it will become a Gelly. If the taſt of Saffron or Cinnamon be diſpleaſing, or you deſire to have your Gelly more cooling, add inſtead thereof the Juyce of a Lemmon, or of one Citron.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Reſtorative Broths may be made divers waies; this is far the beſt of all, which follows:</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>a well fleſhed Capon; pull, draw, and cut him in pieces, and take away the fat and skin: add, if you pleaſe, ſome Veal, or Weather Mutton cut into bits, and freed from the Fat. Put them into a ſtone Veſſel well glazed; in which, about the middle, there muſt be a grate of Wood, or other materials, on which the pieces aforeſaid muſt be ſo laied that they may not come at the bottom. Then cover the Pipkin with its cover, and cloſe it up well with paſte, and let it ſtand in boyling</hi> Balneo Mariae <hi>five hours. There will drop into the bottom a cleer transparent Liquor; of which three of four ſpoonfuls, may be given in Broth, or by it ſelf, three or four times in a day.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Such Diſtillations of Fleſh by Deſcent, are very convenient for Hectical Perſons; but thoſe that are made by Aſcent, although they refreſh the Spirits, yet do they very little nouriſh; neither do they reſtore the ſolid ſubſtance of the Body.</p>
                        <p>Let the Patients Drink be, Barley Water, either by it ſelf, or with Syrup of Vinegar, or Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granates mingled therewith, or Water in which a piece of Bread hath been boyled, ſweetened with a little Sugar. But if the Patients Stomach be very weak, weak Wine wel allaied with Water may be allowed, which helps the concoction and diſtribution of Nouriſhment. <hi>Galen,</hi> Meth. 10. Chap. 5, 6. gives cold Water, with which he boaſts he had ſaved many from the Maraſmus. Howbeit, great Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to be uſed in the giving thereof; for when the Body is very much pined away, it is to be ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red leſt the ſmal heat of the Patient ſhould be wholly extinguiſhed. And therefore it is only good when an Hectick is feared, or in the beginning thereof, and to ſuch as are accuſtomed thereunto, and while the Body is yet ſufficiently ful of blood.</p>
                        <p>Motion of the Body is not good, but the Patient muſt be enjoyned to reſt; howbeit before Meat, if ſtrength wil bear it, ſome light exerciſe wil be good; or inſtead thereof, a few light frictions or rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bings may ſerve turn, eſpecially preſently after ſleep, beginning at the inferior parts of the Body; for they provoke the Humors outward. And the Patient muſt be rubbed no longer than til a light red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs begin to appear upon the Skin; for to rub longer would dry the Body. Carnal Embracements muſt be above al things avoided, which do very much conſume the ſubſtance of the Body.</p>
                        <p>Let the Patient ſleep, neither very long, nor very little. For long ſleep encreaſeth the heat of the Bowels, by the retiring of the Natural warmth inwards: too ſhort ſleep dries the body more. But there is leſs inconvenience from ſleeping a little over largely, than too ſcantily, becauſe ſleep doth exceedingly moiſten, which in this Feaver is very much to be deſired. Let the Patient ſleep in a ſoft bed, and that a Flock-bed, not a Feather-bed, and large enough. Let the Patients Linnen be often changed, which muſt be ſprinkled with Roſe-Water before they be put on.</p>
                        <p>If there be Coſtiveneſs, the Belly muſt be provoked with a Suppoſitory, or a Clyſter of Chicken Broth, with Barley, Mallows, and Violet Leaves boyled in it; adding Caſſia, Honey of Roſes, But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the Yolks of Eggs.</p>
                        <p>Finally, The Mind muſt be preſerved in peace and cheerfulneſs, avoiding vehement Perturbations, as Anger, Sadneſs, Fear.</p>
                        <p>As for point of Medicaments fit for Hectick Perſons, they are Internal or External. Among In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, in the firſt place Purgers muſt be conſidered; and becauſe addition is more neceſſary than detraction in this Diſeaſe, Purgers can hardly be convenient, unleſs a putrid Feaver be joyned with the Hectick. Yet if the firſt Region of the Body ſeem filled with Excrements, becauſe of Crudities ariſing from a weak Stomach, Purgation may ſafely be uſed with Caſſia, Manna, or Syrup of Roſes. Nay verily, if ſtrength be not deficient, the Infuſion of Rhubarb may be given, with a Decoction of Prunes, Tamarinds, Myrobalans, Bugloſs, and Violets.</p>
                        <p>But Altering Medicines may be reduced into the form of Juleps, Broths, and Emulſions, after this manner:</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Waters of Endive, Lettice, Sorrel, of each four ounces: Syrup of Violets, Water Lillies, Apples, of each one ounce. Mix all into a Julep for three Doſes, to be taken at ſeveral times in one day, and to be continued for divers daies together.</hi> Or,</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Whol Barley one pugil: Leaves of Endive, Cichory, Lettice, Pimpernel, of each one handful: Flowers of Borrage, Bugloſs, Violets, and Water-lillies, of each one Pugil: Damask Prunes three pair: Boyl all to a pint and an half. In the ſtrained Liquor, diſſolve ſimple Syrup of Cichory, and of Water-lillies, of each two ounces. Make of all a Julep for four Doſes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Of the ſame Simples with a Chicken or a Pullet, may be made a Broth for the ſame uſe. Or,</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Roots of China one dram and an half: Entire Barley two pugils: the four greater cool Seeds half an ounce. Beat all together, and therewith fill the Belly of a Capon, or yong Pullet, and make Broth; to which add Sugar of Roſes half an ounce. Let the Patient take of this broth a long time together. It reſtores fleſh and fatneſs.</hi>

                        <p>In extream conſumption of the Fleſh, nouriſhing Clyſters are frequently to be injected, of the Broth of a Chicken, or Weathers Head, with Sugar and the Yolks of Eggs. But their Quantity muſt be ſmal, or elſe compreſſing the Guts, they wil provoke the Expulſive Faculty to drive them out.</p>
                        <p>But among other Medicines moſt convenient for Hectical Perſons, Milk is a principal one, it being endued with all the qualities which can deſired in this Diſeaſe, namely, of cooling and moſtening; it nouriſheth much, and is eaſily diſtributed into all parts of the Body. In the uſe whereof, the ſame Cautions muſt be obſerved, which were ſet down in the Cure of a Conſumption.</p>
                        <p>Among External Remedies, a Bath of freſh Water is principal; for it powerfully cools and moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtens, and relaxeth the external Parts that they may more readily receive Nouriſhment. Among the Ancients the uſe of Baths was moſt frequent, and there were four parts of the bathing place: In the firſt ſomwhat warm, they put off their Cloaths: In the ſecond there was a bathing Veſſel of hot Water: In the third a bathing Veſſel of cold Water: In the fourth the Sweatineſs and Moiſture was dried off. <hi>Galen</hi> in 10. Meth. Chap. 19. doth thus moderate the uſe of theſe parts of the Bath; That the Patients ſhould be brought into the firſt part of the Bath, which was heated with the vapor of the bath, that the pores of their bodies might be opened; then being anointed with freſh ſweet Oyl, they were to be plunged in the hot Water to moiſten their bodies; and then they were of a ſudden to be thrown into the cold Water, quickly to be taken out again, and to be dried and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed with Oyl, that the pores being cloſed, the moiſture may be received from the hot bath, might be retained. But inaſmuch as the Induſtrious Diligence of the Ancients in the uſe of bathing, is long ſince out of uſe; and our Practitioners have likewiſe left this Method of bathing Hectical perſons, which they judg unſafe, ſeeing it is to be feared, leſt by the ſudden receiving of the cold Water, the Patients Body ſhould be hurt, and the Patient not be able to endure the ſudden ſence of contrary qualities. So that our Practitioners do more adviſedly, and more compendiouſly, whiles they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh the Patients into a bath of Water moderately hot, in the morning, after a ſtool procured by Nature, or by Art, and two or three hours after they have eaten ſome broth, or milk, or the Yolks of Eggs; wherein they abide ſolong, till it grow luke-warm of it ſelf, and at laſt cold. For ſeeing <hi>Galen</hi> conceives the uſe of a cold hath after an hot to be ſo neceſſary, that without it the hot bath doth no good: the uſe of a cold bath is ſupplied, if the Patients ſtay ſo long in the bath til of it ſelf it grow luke-warm, and cold. But this Caution is to be obſerved, That whereas a three-ſold quality may be had in the ſame bath, the Patient muſt abide in the hot a little while, in the luke-warm longer, in the cold leaſt of al.</p>
                        <p>And although the Ancients were wont to make their baths of ſimple Water; yet is it good to make them more moiſtening by boyling therein Emollient and moiſtening Herbs, as Mallows, Marth-mal-lows, Violet Leaves, &amp;c. or with barley and beaten Almonds, eſpecially in the Summer, becauſe a bath of Decoction of Herbs is ſooner corrupted. After bathing, the ſick is ſoftly to be wiped with hot Cloaths: then to be anointed with Oyl of Violets, ſweet Almonds, with freſh Butter; and after ſome time of reſt, let the Patient eat ſome broth, or other food.</p>
                        <p>A bath of Water and Oyl, is exceedingly cried up by <hi>Zacutus Luſitanus,</hi> in the 35. Obſervation of his third Book of wonderful Cures; where with he ſaies a yong woman was cured, when a bath of ſimple Water and Goats Milk could not help. The reaſon of which great good, he renders to be this; Becauſe bath made of freſh Water, with ſtore of Oyl in it, doth ſoften the diſtended ſtiff parts, doth moiſten the dry and withered: and by opening the pores obſtructed, and through dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs contracted, it draws the Nouriſhment to the outmoſt, and moſt diſtant parts of the body.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="560" facs="tcp:49088:252"/>When the Patient cannot uſe baths, apply an Epithem to the Heart and Liver, in this manner com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Waters of Roſes, Water-lillies, and Purſlain, of each three ounces: Juyce of Pome-Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates an ounce: Pouder of</hi> Diamargaritum frigidum <hi>two drams: Bones out of the Stags Heart one ſcruple: Camphire four grains: Make an Epithem for the Heart.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Waters of Endive, Lettice, Cichory, of each three ounces: Vinegar of Roſes one ounce: the three Sanders, of each two ſcruples: Burnt Ivory one ſcruple. Make an Epithem to be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Liver.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Alſo the Region of the Liver may be anointed with Oyntment of Roſes, or <hi>Ceratum Santalinum.</hi> But Oyls and Unguents muſt be ſparingly uſed, becauſe they may ſomtimes encreaſe the Feaver.</p>
                        <p>Among the Symptomes which are wont to come upon this Diſeaſe, the chief is a Looſneſs, which is wont to bring the Patients to their death. This is to be bridled with a Decoction of French-bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley toaſted, for their ordinary drink, Syrup of Quinces, dried Roſes, Chalybeate Milk, Rice boyled in Milk, and ſuch like.</p>

                        <p>P<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trid Feavers are divided, into Continual, or intermitting. The continual Putrid Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are generated when a putrid Vapor, or a preternatural Heat, which ariſeth from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefied Humors, doth perpetually afflict the Heart, and ſtirs up therein a continual Heat; from whence likewiſe is perpetually diffuſed a Feaveriſh Heat into the whol body. But the intermitting Feavers are cauſed, when the ſaid Vapors are carried unto the Heart, only at certain diſtances of time. Continual Feavers are again divided into Eſſential, and Primary, or Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomatical. Thoſe are called Eſſential and Primary, which ſpring from a putrefaction inflamed in the common Veins, and not in any particular part of the Body. Thoſe are Symptomatical that ariſe from the putrefaction or ſuppuration of ſom particular part inflamed; out of which part by commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Veſſels, a putrid vapor may continually be carried unto the Heart: Such feavers are ſeen in the Pleuriſie, Inflamation of the Lungs, Inflamation of the Liver, and in the Inflamation of other Internal Parts. Again, the Primary continual Feavers are two-fold; for ſome are without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Exacerbation or Fits, and remiſſion, but continue alike from the beginning to the end, and are called <hi>Sunochi,</hi> or <hi>Continentes.</hi> But others have manifeſt Exacerbations or fits, and remiſſions, and are called <hi>Sunecheis,</hi> or <hi>Continuae,</hi> by the name of the kind. And theſe again from the difference of their Exacerbations or fits, and remiſſions, are divided into three ſorts. For ſome are called continual Tertians, which have their Exacerbations or fits every third day; others continual Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidians that are exaſperated every day; others continual Quartans, that are exasperated every fourth day. The intermitting Feavers or Agues, are likewiſe divided into Tertians, Quotidians, and Quartans, according as their Fits are wont to return every third, every fourth, or every day. There are other Differences of Feavers likewiſe, which are either Accidental, or ariſe from the Compoſition of thoſe aforeſaid; all which we ſhall Particularly and briefly Explain.</p>

                        <p>ALthough there are divers ſorts of a continual putrid Feaver, yet have I determined to deſcribe the Cure of them all together, becauſe in a manner the ſame Remedies are ſuitable to all, of which ſome differ only in more or leſs, and are accordingly to be varied; which depends more upon the Judgment of a Phyſitian, and his Dexterity attained by Practice, than upon particular Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, Yet ſhall I as neer as I can, obſerve what is peculiar to every ſort of Feaver, in its peculiar place.</p>
                        <p>Feavers Putrid, Continual, and Primary, or Eſſential, are wont to be bred of the putrefaction of Humors, which are contained in the Veins and greater Arteries: And according to the various Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of putrefying Humors, ſeveral Species do ariſe.</p>

                           <hi>Synochus Putrida</hi> is diſtinguiſhed with no fits or exacerbations, but its whol time is taken up as it were with one fit, which reaches from the beginning to the end of the Diſeaſe and of this as of a ſimple Feaver there are made three differences. The firſt whereof is, that which continues all alike during from the beginning to the end. The ſecond is that which encreaſes by degrees. The third is that which decreaſes by little and li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>tle. The firſt is named <hi>Acmaſtica</hi> or <hi>Homotonos,</hi> and it happens when the whol courſe of the Diſeaſe the manner of putrefaction is one and the ſame. The ſecond is called <hi>Epacmaſtica,</hi> when more putrefies than is diſſipated. The third is called <hi>Paracmaſtica</hi> when leſs putrefies than is diſſipated. Yet allthough theſe kind of Feavers do perpetually increaſe or decreaſe, or keep the ſame Tenor: yet doth not this hinder but that they have four times, if they terminate in health; but ſome have them longer, others ſhorter, if they be conſidered according to the vehemency of the <hi>Symptomes.</hi> So that which is called <hi>Homotonos,</hi> hath a very breif beginning and Augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but a long ſtate. The Epacmaſtick hath a long augment: the paracmaſtick a long declination, but the other times do quickly paſs away. Yet we muſt know, that the times of Putrid Feavers are two waies conſidered; either with reſpect to the Symptomes, or with reſpect of coction and crudity; which two in other Feavers do commonly comcide or happen at one and the ſame time: But in theſe continent Feavers called <hi>Sunochoi</hi> it is not ſo. For their times ought not ſo much to be defined by the increaſe and decreaſe of the Symptomes, as by the ſigns of Concoction or non Concoctions, which appear cheifly in the Urines.</p>
                        <p>Now <hi>Galen</hi> propounds two ſorts of this continent Feaver called <hi>Synochus:</hi> one ſpringing from Blood putrefying, of which he treates in the ſecond of this Method Chap. 7. and 9. as alſo in the 9. of his Method Chap. 3. and 5. another ariſing of choller putrefying in the greater veſſells, of the kind of burning Feavers, which he explaines in his ſecond of the Differences of Feavers and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of Criſes Chap. 6. The firſt is called <hi>Synochus Sanguinea;</hi> and the other <hi>Synochus Bilioſa.</hi> For allthough the whol Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So then; if that more temperate Part, which is more eſpecially called Blood, do ſurmount the reſt in quantity, and the whol Maſs putrefy, that Feaver is cauſed which we term <hi>Synochus Sanguinea.</hi> But if the thinner and hotter Part of the Blood, which is of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>A continual tertian, which every third day doth more afflict the Patient than ordinary, takes its Riſe from bad and Chollerick Blood putrefying in the <hi>Vena Cava.</hi> And the Cauſes thereof are all ſuch things as multiply this Humor in the Body, as an hot and dry diſtemper of the Liver, Meats hot and dry, Youthfull Age; faſting or very ſpare Diet; vehement and frequent exerciſe; hot and dry conſtitution of the Air; over great watchings and ſuch like.</p>
                        <p>A continual Quotidian (which the Barbarous writers term <hi>Latica</hi> or lurking, becauſe it hath a certain, hidden and concealed heat) is produced by flegmatick Blood putrefying within the Veins; &amp; therefore it hath its exacerbations or fits every day. It is wont to aſſail flegmatick bodies, as of Infants and Children and old men, as alſo of ſuch as are of a fat and corpulent conſtitution given to idleneſs and cramming of bellvchear, and inhabiting moiſt places. This kind of Feaver happens but ſeldom becauſe flegm is hardly putrefied.</p>
                        <p>A continual Quartan, is that which is exaſperated every fourth day, being Cauſed of Melancholly Blood putrefying in the branches of <hi>Vena Cava.</hi> And all things may Cauſe this Feaver, which are apt to breed Melancholly Blood and to Cauſe the ſame to putrefy. Howbeit this kind of Feaver is moſt rarely obſerved.</p>
                        <p>The accidental differences of Feavers are taken from their evil Symptomes, which are wont to be complicated with the Eſſentiall, and from them they are named.

allwaies, and evidently conjoyned therewith. The baſtard, in which thoſe ſymptomes are leſs vehement, the thirſt leſs Urgent, and the body not ſo burning. The Lightimate is Cauſed by a Chollerick Humor putrefying within the large Veſſels near the heart; the baſtard is cauſed by Choller mingled with Flegm or Salt Flegm putrefying in the Veſſels aforeſaid. Whence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares that a Ligitimate burning Feaver is no other, but a continual <hi>Tertian</hi> Feaver, whoſe Matter is more ſharp and plentiful than ordinary and conteined in the larger Veſſels which are neer the Heart; whereas the Matter cauſing a ſimple continual Tertian is in Veſſels Remoter from the Heart. Again there are two ſorts of an exquiſite burning Feaver the one from the beginning to the end hath one only acceſſion or fit, which we before named <hi>Synochus Bilioſa,</hi> and it is likewiſe called <hi>Synochus Ardens;</hi> which is cauſed when the Humor putrefying doth occupy al the Veſſels which are moſt neert the Heart: the other is named <hi>Ardens Periodica</hi> and conteines in it ſelf divers fits or acceſſions; it is cauſed by the ſame Choller conteined in the Veſſels neer the Heart, but not in al or not ſo neer as in <hi>Synochus Ardens.</hi> So that a Continual Tertian, <hi>Synochus Ardens,</hi> and <hi>Ardens Periodica,</hi> do differ one from another, only as the Choller cauſing them is more or leſs ſharp, plentiful, and neer the Heart.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Aſſades Febris,</hi> the Feaver ſo called, is a kind of burning Feaver, in which the ſick do tumble and toſs and are exceeding unquiet, much oppreſſed with the diſeaſe, being for the moſt Part ſubject to ſtomach ſickneſs and vomiting. Becauſe it is wont to ariſe from the vexation of the Stomach by ſharp and Chollerick Humors, biting the orifice or Coats thereof.</p>
                        <p>The Feaver <hi>Elodes,</hi> is that in which the Patient prepetually Sweats: and it is cauſed by a mighty Putrefaction or Maliginty of Humors, diſſolving the Subſtance of the Body.</p>
                        <p>The Feaver <hi>Syncopalis,</hi> is that in which the Patient often Swoones and Faints away. <hi>Avicenna</hi> makes two ſorts hereof, one of thin ſharp and Venemous Choller: another of much Flegm, or abundance of crude Humors. The former is called <hi>Syncopalis Minuta,</hi> becauſe it ariſes from a little Quantity of Humor, but thin and malignant. The latter <hi>Avicenna</hi> doth call <hi>Syncopalis Humo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſa vel Repletionalis,</hi> becauſe of a great Quantity of crude and Flegmatick Humors abounding therein and there is alſo Joyned a weakneſs of the mouth of the ſtomach, by which means e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>That Feaver is by <hi>Galen</hi> termed <hi>Epiala 2. de diff. Feb. cap. 2. &amp; Lib. de inaequali intemperie cap.</hi> 8. in which at the ſame time, through the whol Body in the ſmalleſt particles thereof there is felt both cold and heat. For, albeit one and the ſame Part cannot be the ſubject of contrary qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities: yet is that which hath been ſaid of this Feaver to be underſtood of the ſmalleſt particles in reſpect of ſenſe, but not indeed and in truth. <hi>Galen</hi> ſhewes that this Feaver is cauſed two waies; the one is by means or Glaſſy Flegm mingled with bitter Choller and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>o diffuſed into the whol body. For Choller cauſes a ſence of heat and the Flegm a ſence of cold. The other is by means of Glaſſy Flegm alone, but partly putrefied and partly void of putrefaction. For, inaſmuch as Glaſſy Flegm is extream cold and clammy, it doth not readily putrefy, nor al at once, but only by peecemeal; ſo that one portion thereof being putrefied the other remains unputrefied. That Part of the ſaid flegm therefore, which is not putrefied being ſhed among the ſenſitive Parts, cauſes a ſence of cold, by reaſon of the extream coldneſs thereof; and that which is putrefied cauſes a ſence of heat. And ſo the whol body at one and the ſame time feels both cold and heat. <hi>Platerus</hi> alſo hath invented a way how this Feaver may be bred, viz. when intermitting Feavers, or Agues, do one fal upon the Neck of another the ſame day in the ſame Patient, ſo that the cold fit of the latter Ague begins, ere the hot ſit of the former be ended; or elſe when intermitting Feavers co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>There are likewiſe other accidental differences of continual Feavers, which becauſe they are wont
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:49088:254"/>
to be reckoned among the Symptomatick Feavers, they ſhal be diſcuſſed forthwith in the Deſcription of the ſaid Symptomatick Feavers.</p>
                        <p>Now although the Cure of Symptomatick Feavers depend upon the Cure of thoſe Diſeaſes in particular, from whence they ariſe, yet muſt we declare their Nature, leaſt they come to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with Eſſential or Primary Feavers.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe therefore are called Symptomatical Feavers, which ariſe from the Inflamation and putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Humors conteined in ſome of the Bowels. Of which kind are thoſe Feavers which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the Pleuriſy, Inflamation of the Lungs, Frenzy, Squinzy, Inflamation of the Liver, and other Inflamations, Ulcers or Impoſtumes of the internal Parts.</p>
                        <p>And it is diligently to be obſerved, as a thing of great moment in Practice and by few taken notice of, that al Feavers perpetually which are Joyned with Inflamations of the Parts of the Body, are not Symptomatical; But that ſome of them are eſſential &amp; the foreſaid Inflamations, do follow upon them. For it often falles out that Blood corrupted or filled with evil Humors, after it hath raiſed a Feaver, comes to be agitated by Nature and her as hurtful to her expelled to the weaker Parts, or to ſuch as are moſt convenient to receive them: whereupon an Inflamation is cauſed in thoſe Parts, which doth not cauſe the Feaver, but is rather a Conſequent thereof. So we may often ſee in the Courſe of our Practice, the Patients ſick of a continual Feaver, for a day or two before Pain in the ſide and other Signes of a Pleuriſy appears So many on the third or fourth day fal into a Phrenſy; ſo, al Gouty perſons in a manner, before they are troubled with Pain, ſwelling and Inflamation of their Joynts, are wont to have a continual Feaver for a day or two. So they which have the Roſe or Saint <hi>Anthonies</hi> Fire, have a Feaver ſomtime, before the ſwelling break forth. The ſame thing appears by the Urine, which in ſuch Inflamations as theſe, do ſhew manifeſt ſigns of putrefaction in the Veins. For in the beginning they appear crude and undigeſted, and in the progreſs, they ſhew tokens of concoction dayly encreaſing. Alſo Blood is often taken away very corrupt. Which things would not happen if ſuch Feavers were only Symptomatical, ſimply depending upon thoſe Inflamations.</p>
                        <p>And theſe Feavers whether they be Symptomatical or primary and attended by Inflamations of the Parts, have their accidental differences. For if the Inflamation be of Blood, the Feaver is called <hi>Phlegmonodes:</hi> if it be of Choller, <hi>Typhodes.</hi> And peculiarly an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> or Chollerick Inflama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſtomach and Guts brings the Feavers called <hi>Zipyria,</hi> in which the outward Parts are very cold and the inward Parts burn. For the inward burning doth draw the Blood and ſpirits co the Part inflamed; whereby the heat is ſo encreaſed, that the inward Parts ſeem to be burned with unquenchable thirſt, but the outward are cold, being deſtitute of heat and ſpirit.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Lenta Febris,</hi> the flow or Lingring Feavers, is wont alſo to be reckoned amongſt Symptomatical Feavers, which ariſes from ſome hidden obſtruction and putrefaction, ſticking ſo cloſe to ſome Bowel and ſo impacted, that the ſubſtance of the Bowel is for the moſt Part Vitiated. And when a portion of the putrid Humor is ſhed into the Veins and mixed with the Blood, it ſtirrs up a ſlow Feaver, and ſo mild, that it troubles the Patient with no greivous ſymptom, yea and the Patient is ſcarſe ſenſible of any Feaver. Yet ſome notes of putrefaction appear in the Pulſe and Urin. And ſomtimes this <hi>Febris Lenta</hi> is bred of the putrefaction and corruption of ſome of the bowells; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by the Veins inſerted into that Bowel, putrid and hot Vapors do breath unto the Heart. Such a kind of Feaver is often bred in the Conſumption of the Lungs, which degenerates into an Hectick. It is alſo ſomtimes cauſed when the ſubſtance of the Liver or ſpleen corrupts: or when putrefaction ſettles upon the Meſentery, the Caul or the Pancrea, or other Parts; or alſo ſomtimes when the Child or After-birth are corrupted in the Womb. And hence not only ſlow Feavers, but ſomtimes alſo acute ones do ariſe, according to the different Nature of the putrefactions. And finally, to this kind of ſlow Feavers, thoſe are to be referred, which are found in Cachectical perſons, and in Maids which have the Green-Sickneſs; which <hi>Fernelius</hi> conceives do ariſe from a light putrefaction of wheyiſh flegm ſhed abroad in the Body.</p>
                        <p>Beſides theſe forenamed differences of continual Feavers, which are moſt frequent, and are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſet down by Authors; there are alſo ſome other, ariſing from peculiar and extraordinary Cauſes, which ſomtimes we meet with in our Practice. The Caſe of a certain Infant may ſerve for example, propounded by <hi>Zechius</hi> in his 46. Counſel. The Infant was ſcarce two yeares old, and had a continual Feaver, with moſt greivous Symptomes viz. Unquietneſs, convulſions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual ſtomach Sickneſs enclining to Vomit; and it was conjectured that there was ſome Malignity adjoyned, becauſe ſuch greivous ſymptomes did not anſwer to that Feaver. For al the external Parts were cold, though the inner Parts were burned with heat, as appeared by the heat about the breſt and under the ſhort Ribs, and alſo from the dryneſs and blackneſs of the Tongue. The Cauſe of which was blood putrifying conteined in the ſtomach. For this Infant being tongue-tied, was lately cut by a Chirurgion, in which work ſome Veins or other was opened which ſhed ſome blood into the ſtomach, which putrefying there, by ſending forth hot, putrid, and as it were poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous Vapors into the heart and Brain, was the Cauſe of al the ſymptomes aforeſaid. But how
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:49088:255"/>
this cauſe was found out and removed, it is worth the while here to recite, out of the Story of <hi>Zechius. So often</hi> (quoth he) <hi>as I diligently conſider with my ſelf, how hard a thing it is to underſtand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Diſeaſes, and thier cauſes, I come eaſily to be of the mind that</hi> Hippocrates <hi>in his ſecond Book of vulgar Diſeaſes, Sect. 4. did not without greateſt premeditation leave in writing; then in the Curing of all hidden Diſeaſes, the Phyſitian muſt diligently enquire the firſt aſſault of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, that is to ſay, the firſt occaſion of the Patients illneſs. For of that for the moſt part depends the knowledg both of the Cauſe and Cure. See an Example hereof: This Diſeaſe of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Child was very acute, and the Cauſe very hard to find, had not I diligently asked of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents touching the conditions of the Child and the Nurſe; who told me that two daies before its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt ill, a certain Chyrurgeon had cut the Membrane, whereby the Tongue of it was faſtened to the parts beneath it. And when I again asked them, if preſently after this was done, they had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Child to be held forward, or if any blood had come out of its mouth; they ſaid no, it was neither ſo held, neither came any blood from the mouth of it. Whereupon I preſently conjectured, that blood was fallen from the place cut into the Stomach, and there putreſied, and was the cauſe of the Diſeaſe, and symptomes aforeſaid. Neither did my Opinion deceive me; for having given it Oyl of ſweet Almonds to make it vomit, it uttered a conſiderable quantity of clotted blood, and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſh. Alſo it voided with a Clyſter many clodders of blood. And preſently, by the bleſſing of God Almighty, the Feaver was abated, and all Symptomes began to ceaſe. Whereupon it fell gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily and luſtily on ſucking its Nurſe, and all the following night it ſlept quietly, and was afterward perfectly well.</hi>

                        <p>The Diagnoſtick Signs of putrid continual Feavers, do ſome of them ſhew the continu'ty, others the putrefaction, and the reſt the peculiar differences of them.</p>
                        <p>The continuity is eaſily known, in that the Feavers is continual, and hath no intermiſion.</p>
                        <p>The putrefaction is ſignified by a ſharper heat than ordinary, and more biting, and by a ſharp and biting Sooty vapor, produced by the exhalation of putrid Humors. The pulſe is not only great and frequent, and oftentimes unequal; but it hath this peculiar property, That the Syſtole is quicker than the Diaſtole; becauſe the Expulſion of Sooty Excrements is more neceſſary than refrigeration. The Urins are in the beginning crude, or very little digeſted The Exacerbations or fits keep their cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain times, which yet is not to be underſtood of the Feaver Synochus. A cold ſhaking fit at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Diſeaſe. Hereunto are added various Symptomes, commonly accompanying putrid Feavers, as Ilneſs of ſtomach, vomiting, heavineſs of the body, pain of the head, raving, giddineſs of the head, hiccoughs, anxiety, heart-burning, thirſt, roughneſs and blackneſs of the tongue, ſtretching of the parts under the ſhort ribs, and the reſt. Before which preceded, wearineſs without labor, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, troubled ſleeps, watchings, tenſion of the parts under the ſhort ribs, difficult breathing, pain and pulſation of the head, ſtomach-ſickneſs, want of Appetite, plenty of ſtinking Excrements, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent yawnings and reachings, or ſome of theſe.</p>
                        <p>But the peculiar Differences of continual putrid Feavers, may be diſcerned by theſe Signs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing:</p>
                        <p>A continual putrid Feaver, called <hi>Synochus putrida,</hi> hath the ſame ſigns which were propounded in <hi>Synocha ſimplici,</hi> but more vehement; for the heat is more ſharp, the watchings, head-ach, thirſt, diſquiet, and other Symptomes are more vehement; alſo the pulſe is unequal, ſo that the Syſtole ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears greater than the Diaſtole, the Urines are crude, red, and thick.</p>
                        <p>The Signs of a Feaver from Choller, are burning pain, a pulſe mighty frequent and ſwift, a ſharp Urine, fiery, in the beginning alwaies crude, without Sediment; Stomach-ſickneſs, Chollerick vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitings and Stools Chollerick, much anxiety, mighty thirſt, bitterneſs of the mouth, drineſs and blackneſs of the tongue, watchings, raving, and an ulcerous kind of wearineſs, ſoregoing, paleneſs of Face, or a citrine Color, youthful Age, temperature hot and dry, Summer ſeaſon, hot and dry Diet, Chollerick Evacuations ſuppreſſed. And a continual Tertian is diſtinguiſhed from a <hi>Synochus bilio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi> or continent Feaver ſpringing of Choller, becauſe it hath Exacerbations or fits every third day, but the <hi>Synochus bilioſa,</hi> keeps ſtil one and the ſame tenor.</p>
                        <p>The Signs of a continual Quotidian are, Heat at firſt rather vaporous than biting, afterwards ſomwhat ſharp, but unequal, becauſe of the thickneſs of the Humor which is difficultly diſſolved; the Urines are at firſt white, watry, troubled; afterward ſomwhat red and thick; the Pulſe is ſeldomer, ſlower, and leſs than in the reſt of theſe Feavers; thirſt little or none; ſeldom ſweat, unleſs there be ſalt flegm; the Face of the Patient is ſomwhat bloat or blown up, lax, flaggy, and as it were Lead colored; Drowzineſs, want of Appetite, flegmatick Excretions, a cold and moiſt Temperament, old Age, Winter Seaſon, Cold and Moiſt Diet, Evacuations ſuppreſſed, and a dayly Excretion of the Diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>A continual Quartan is known by theſe Signs. The Heat is leſs ſharp than in Feavers of Choller, yet ſharper than in Feavers of Flegm; likewiſe Thirſt greater than in a Quotidian, and leſſer than in a Tertian; a Pulſe in the beginning ſlow, rare, languiſhing; afterward ſtronger, frequenter, and
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:49088:255"/>
very unequal. The Urine in the beginning thin, afterwards various; the body dry and lean, of a tawny or ſwarthy color; Temperament cold and dry; Age inclining; Autumn of the Yeer, or very changable weather; a life intangled with many Cares and Studies; ſuppreſſion of the Hemorrholds, Swelling of the Spleen, and Exacerbation or vehemency more than ordinary of the Feaver every fourth day.</p>
                        <p>The Signs of a <hi>Cauſus</hi> or burning proper to that Diſeaſe, were propounded before, viz. a burning heat of the Body, and an unquenchable Thirſt. Yet it is to be marked, if any Cough a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, that the Patients Thirſt is thereby diminiſhed, viz. by ſuch moiſture as is drawn by the Cough out of adjacent parts; howbeit, the Cough is never wholly taken away while the Feaver laſts. The other Signs are all ſuch as we have before ſhewed, do ſignifie a Feaver from Choller. Yet the ſigns which ſignifie a baſtard burning Feaver, are much more remiſs than the foreſaid.</p>
                        <p>A melting Feaver is known by a ſudden Conſumption of the Body, and growing lean; the Eyes are hollow, the Temples fallen, Noſe ſharp, Stools red, fat, ſtinking, clammy, corpulent, ſincere, chollerick, and frothy; the Urines, fat and Oyly.</p>
                        <p>The Shivering Feaver, and the tumbling and toſſing Feavers are to be known, by what is ſaid of them in their Deſcriptions.</p>
                        <p>In the Feaver called <hi>Elodes,</hi> the Skin is ever moiſt with a clammy moiſture, and the heat to feel to, is not very ſharp. Malignity is diſtinguiſhed from the largeneſs of putrefaction; becauſe in Caſe of malignity, the Urines are in a manner Natural, or appear not much different from the Natural; or ſomwhat ſwins in the Urines like a Spiders Web, when the Fat melts; or if with the Urine there comes away ſomwhat like Vetches or Barley, which ſignifie a melting of the fleſh; or finally, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Urine coming divers daies together, when the blood and humors are melted. Add hereunto an extream decay of ſtrength; a ſmal contracted Pulſe, not very frequent. In great putrefaction the Urines are thick and troubled, the Pulſe great, ſoft, and frequent.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Syncopalis Febris,</hi> viz. the Swooning Feaver, is known by fainting ſits, and ſwoonings frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly befalling the ſick. And that ſort called <hi>Minuta,</hi> is diſtinguiſhed from that <hi>Humoroſa,</hi> becauſe in the former are ſeen the ſigns of a Chollerick, in the latter of a Flegmatick Feaver, as they were lately ſet down.</p>
                        <p>The Feaver <hi>Epiala</hi> is known only hereby, That at the ſame time, heat and cold is felt in the whol Body.</p>
                        <p>Finally, Symptomatick Feavers, and ſuch as are called <hi>Comitatae,</hi> are known by what hath been ſaid of them in their Hiſtories, or Deſcriptions.</p>
                        <p>Now in every of theſe ſorts of continual putrid Feavers, the Prognoſtick Signs are to be deſcribed, by which their events may be preſaged.</p>
                        <p>And firſt for <hi>Synochus Putrida,</hi> ſeeing it is of the kind of acute Feavers, it is not without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Yet if ſigns-of Concoction do evidently appear upon the fourth day, and no error be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it will terminate towards health the ſeventh day. But if the Signs of Concoction appear later, it may reach unto the eleventh or fourteenth day. But if no ſigns of Concoction appear, and the ſick have a round ſwollen Face like a Globe, it ſignifies the Diſeaſe will be long. By how much the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine is redder at the beginning, other ſigns correſponding, by ſo much ſafer it is, and ſignifies the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe wil ſoon come to an end, if there appear therein ſigns of Concoction; but with ſigns of Crudity it threatens death, eſpecially if the party be weak. White Urine is the worſt of all, and commonly portends death. Among the Differences of <hi>Synochus, Paracmaſtica</hi> is more ſecure, <hi>Acmaſtica</hi> more dangerous, <hi>Epacinaſtica</hi> moſt dangerous of all. Furthermore, an exquiſite <hi>Synochus,</hi> and benign rightly Cured, is ſafe; a baſtard one that hath malignity in it, with cruel Symptomes, and ſtrength decayed, is dangerous.</p>
                        <p>Chollerick Feavers inaſmuch as they are acute, are alſo dangerous; and that more or leſs, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the more or leſs diſtemper, vehemence of the Symptomes, and validity of the Patients ſtrength. The diſtemper is meaſured not only abſolutely by the degree of Heat it ſelf; but alſo comparatively, with reference to the Natural Conſtitution of the ſick party; ſo that look how much the heat is encreaſed above the Natural temper of the Patient, ſo much the greater is the danger. So a burning Feaver in an old Man, or in Winter, is for the moſt part deadly. The vehemence of Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes, is conſidered in actions Animal, Vital, and Natural; in Excrements, qualities changed, and proper adjuncts; whoſe enumeration requires a work by it ſelf, according as we have expounded them, in the third Section of our <hi>Semiotica,</hi> or Doctrine of Signs, out of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his Aphoriſms, Prognoſticks, Predictions, and his Coic Praenotions, which may eaſily be transferred to this place. And finally, the ſtrength of the Patient muſt be compared with the vehemence of the Symptomes; For if the ſtrength be luſty, and likely to hold out againſt the Cruelty of the Adverſaries, there is good hope; if not, we may juſtly fear the Patients death.</p>
                        <p>A continual Quotidian, is wont to be long by reaſon of the thickneſs and contumacy of the Humor: but if divers Evacuations happen in its courſe, it is wont to be the ſhorter. We muſt meaſure the

danger thereof, by comparing the vehemence of the Symptomes, with the Patients ſtrength. And the cheife care ought to be leaſt it degenerate into a Cachexy or dropſy, by reaſon of the obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Liver and ſpleen, which happen in theſe long Feavers.</p>
                        <p>A Primary continual Quartan is moſt rare, yet ſomtimes an intermittent Feaver or Ague degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates thereinto, and then for the moſt Part deadly.</p>
                        <p>The melting, ſhaking, Tumbling, Sweating and Swouning Feavers, ſeeing they borrow their Names from ſuch bad ſymptomes as they are attended with; they are in regard of ſuch ſymptomes extream dangerous, and for the moſt Part is deadly.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the Prognoſtick of Symptomatick Feavers, is to be gathered from the Excellency of the Parts affected, vehemence of the Symptomes and Validity of the Patients ſtrength.</p>
                        <p>Now in the Cure of al putrid Feavers, we muſt take our Hints or Indications from the Feaver, from its Cauſe and from the Patients ſtrength. The two former indicate their own ablation or removal; the third, its own Preſervation. Which muſt be done by aſſiſtance of thoſe ordinary Medicinal Utenſils viz. Diet, Manual Operation, and Medicaments.</p>
                        <p>The Diet in all Chollerick Feavers ought to be cooling and Moiſtening, in flegmatick and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick more warming and attenuating. Let therefore the Air be cold and moiſt, which being drawn in by the Lungs unto the heart, doth exceedingly temper the burning heat thereof. Yet muſt not the Patient be laid bare to the cold Air, becauſe tranſpiration, which is exceeding needful, would by that means be hindered; and the ſooty Vapours and ſweats would be driven back again into the Body. Howbeit the ſick muſt be covered only with light and ſoft Coverings, and not loaded with over many blankers or Rugs. alſo the Feather-bed muſt be taken away and a flock-bed put in place, upon which alſo in the extremity of Summer a covering of Leather wil conveniently be laid on. Let the bed be wide, that the ſick may change place therein. Let the Patients Linnen Shifts be often changed contrary to the vulgar opinion; provided they be not newly waſhed, nor ſmel of Soap, and that the Time of the Criſis be not at hand, in which nothing is to be ſtirred, leaſt the motion of Nature be hindred and diſturbed. The Sun-beams are to be kept out of the Patients Chamber, and ſtore of Company is to be avoided. Water is often to be powred out of one Veſſel into another, in the ſick Perſons chamber. The Pavement of the Chamber is to be ſprinkled with Water, Vinegar and Roſe-Water mingled; or with cooling Herbs and flowers; as Vine Leaves, Willow Leaves, Leaves of Water Lillies, Flags; Roſes, and flowers of Violets and of Water Lilly; which muſt be kept at hand in good Quantities in a cool place, and be often freſh ſprinkled and ſtrowed about the Patients Chamber; for when theſe Herbs and flowers are dried, they heat the Chamber. If the Chamber be cold, as in winter, it muſt be a little tempered with a fire avoiding Smoak. Howbeit in flegmatick Feavers the Air muſt be Moderately hot and dry.</p>
                        <p>As for Point of Nouriſhment, the Diet ought to be thin and ſpare in acute Feavers. And therein the Antients were ſo ſeverely diligent, as to place the greateſt Part of the Cure in ordering the Diet, enjoyning ſuch as were ſick of a moſt acute Feaver, to keep a moſt thin and ſlender Diet; and giving them nothing but a ptiſan drink of Barley Water, as moſt convenient for perſons in a Feaver; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it cooles, and Moiſtens; withal extenuating and opening and hindering no Evacuation. And they had two kinds of Ptiſans. One ſimply ſo called, or whol Ptiſan not ſtrained; the other was ſtrained, which we cal Barley Cream. Barley clenſed of the Husks boyled in ſair Water, to a Conſiſtency or Pottage, is the whol Ptiſan; this being ſtrained with preſſing, is called Cream or Juyce of Barley.</p>
                        <p>But in our Times, at leaſt in our Country, by the refractoryneſs of Women [who fear nothing but that the ſick perſon ſhal be ſtarved, as al their care in a manner is to cram their Children with meat like Pudding Bags, how empty their Brains be of wit, or their Hearts of Grace and wiſdome, matters not] and the Indulgence of Phyſitians [who the beſt of them ſmel too ſtrong of the Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank] it is grown into a faſhion in al Feavers, yea the moſt acute and violent, to allow the ſick at al times broaths of the fleſh and Hens Chicken, Capons mutton; and that for the moſt Part they give every third or at moſt every fourth hour. And in the Summer the fleſh of a pullet, kid or Lamb is added to the former Diet. And ſomtimes again broaths are made of nothing but a chick with cooling Herbs, as Lettice, Endive, Sorrel and Purſlan. Or to ordinary broaths is added Juyce of Oranges, Lemmons, or Pome-Granats, when the heat of the Feaver is very great, or the putrefaction very intenſe.</p>
                        <p>Moreover in Feavers not ſo very acute Panadaes are given twice or thrice in a day made of waſhed bread and broath. Alſo Barley broaths are ſomtimes uſed of the Ptiſan of the Antients being ſtrained, with the broath of the fleſh aforeſaid, and Sugar; or without broath, adding ſweet Almonds. But theſe for the moſt Part do oppreſs the ſtomach, and therefore the uſe of ſimple broaths and Pana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daes ſeems more convenient. Howbeit very profitable it it to boyl a little Barley with fleſh and thereof to make broaths.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="567" facs="tcp:49088:256"/>In long Feavers, a fuller Diet is fitting, of the fleſh of Chickens, Veal Hens and Pullets, Capons, Partridges, Mutton, or of the Juyce preſſed out of them, Gellies made with them, and ſuch like.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the time of giving the Patients meat, this is principally to be obſerved, that they never eat in the time of the Exacerbation or fit but in the time of the Feaver. But if the Exacerbation be very long, let the Patient eat in the declination thereof.</p>
                        <p>For drink, the Ptiſan of the later Phyſitians, made of the Decoction of Barley with Liquoris, is uſually given in all Feavers. To which if the Feavers be very burning may be added a little Lettice, Sorrel, Tamarinds. But more ordinarily are added the Roots of Graſs or Sorrel which makes the Water look of an Elegant Colour like Wine. But in long Feavers may be added ſweet fennel Roots, Parſley Roots, Annis Seed, Coriander Seed, or Cinnamon, as oft as the ſtomach through weakneſs is offended with drinking.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>of the ordinary Ptiſan-drink of Barley and Liquoris two pints: ſpirit of ſulphur as much as ſhall ſuffice for to make it pleaſantly tart. Harts-Horn burnt till it be white one ounce: Let the Patient uſe it for ordinary drink, ſhaking the Veſſel before it be powred forth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Alſo Water that hath had a peice of bread boyled in it either by it ſelf or ſweetned with Sugar is good; or mingled with a little Vinegar; or Water alone, boyled to take away the Cruditie; wherewith ſomtimes a little Suger is mixed, and ſomtimes a little of the Juyce of Lemmons, Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granats, Barberries, Cherries, or of their Syrups; or as much ſpirit of ſulphur or Vitriol as may ſerve for a great full Acidity; or a little <hi>Sal Prunellae,</hi> if need be of potent refrigeration.</p>
                        <p>Water is commended wherein are ſteeped Tamarinds, Berberies, or Prunes.</p>
                        <p>A Decoction of french Prunes is very pleaſing to the taſt.</p>
                        <p>Or Barley is boyled with Tamarinds, and towards the End, the broath is Aromatized with yellow Sanders and Cinnamon. Which drink doth not only Quench thirſt, but looſens the belly, and cools and ſtrengthens the Liver.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Sugar eight ounces: Sal Prunellae one ounce: Make it into a Pouder, to be taken with the Patients ordinary drink. Whereunto if thirſt be extream, the ſpirit of vitriol may be added.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Touching ſpirit of Vitroil and of Sulphur, this is diligently to be obſerved, that in putrid Feavers the uſe thereof is great, becauſe they have a mighty cooling, opening, and putrefaction quelling faculty; prohibit the Inflamation of the Humors, and quench thirſt. Howbeit in the Pleuriſy, Inflamation of the Lungs, Spitting of blood, Conſumption of the Lungs and other Diſeaſes thereof (unles they ſpring from thick flegm ſtopping the Veſſels thereof) Inflamation of the ſtomach, Dyſentery or bloody flux, Piſſing of blood, Ulcers of the Kidneys and Bladder, they do very much hurt and therefore we muſt abſtain form them.</p>
                        <p>In Feavers ariſing from very thin and hot Choller, or Joyned with a ſharp thin diſtillation, ſharp things are not convenient; but rather ſuch as gently thicken, as Syrup of Violets, of dried red Roſes, with Barly Water, or Bread boyld-Water, or ſimple Water boyled, or ſmal beer, mixed therewith.</p>
                        <p>Where thick and clammy humors abound, the Syrup of Vineger will be very profitable. in ſtead of thoſe laſt named.</p>
                        <p>Alſo ſomtimes Conſerve of Roſes, Violets, or Borrage is wont to be mingled with cleer Water boyled, with Barley Water, and to be ſtrained through an Hippocras bag for ordinary drink, unto which ſome drops of ſpirit of Vitriol may profitably be added. Or a Tincture of Roſes is made after this manner, moſt delightful in colour and in taſt.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Red Roſes one ounce: Bloodwarm Water three pints: ſpirit of ſulphur or Vitriol one dram and an half: Let them ſtand infuſing cold for three or four hours. To the ſtrainings add, white Sugar, four ounces: Roſe-Water half a pint: Make thereof a clear Julep for ordinary drink.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Alſo Julepus Alexandrinus, is very good, and extream pleaſant. It is thus made.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Fountain Water one pint: Roſewater, Juyce of Lemmons, and white Sugar, of each four ounces: Boyl them over a light fire till you have taken away the Scum.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As for other things pertaining to Diet, Sleep is extream good and watchings bad. Yet over much Sleep doth overwhelm the natural heat and hinder the Evacuation of excrements. Reſt is neceſſary in acute Feavers; but in long Feavers, light and gentle exerciſe is good. Alſo we muſt endeavor, that nothing be retained which ought naturally to be expelled; howbeit al immoderate Evacuations, which exhauſt the ſtrength, are to be ſtopped; and al vehement Perturbations of mind, muſt be turned out of Doors.</p>
                        <p>Among manual Operations, Blood-letting holds the cheifeſt place. for it doth not only diminiſh plenitude, whether it be a ſimple fulneſs ſo as to ſtretch the Veſſels, or only a fulneſs with reference to the ſtrength of the Patient; whether it be in the whol body or in ſome Part; but alſo revels the influx of Humors Cauſing obſtructions; cools the whol body and makes it perſpicable; keeps back putrefaction, and furthers the concoction of putrefying Humors. Preſently therefore, and at the
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:49088:257"/>
beginning of the Diſeaſe, blood muſt be drawn (unleſs weakneſs hinder, as in the Swooning Feaver, and other like Caſes) and that after the Belly hath been looſened with a Clyſter, or a Suppoſitory. How much blood ſhould be taken, it gathered from the Patients ſtrength, from the greatneſs of the Ple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>hora, Cuſtom of the Patient to bleed or not to bleed, and other circumſtances. The Antients in the <hi>Synochus Putrida,</hi> and the burning Feaver, did let blood til the Patient fainted away. But it is much more ſafe (as we have ſaid in the Cure of a ſimple Synochus) to take away at ſeveral times ſo much as ſhall be ſufficient; then ſuddenly to put the Patient in danger of death. <hi>Avicen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> in a burning Feaver, and in a continual Tertian, doth forbid letting blood, unleſs the Urine be thick and red. For he fears leſt Choller ſhould be the more inflamed, which he ſaith is bridled by Blood. But the wiſer Phyſitians do explode this Opinion of his, ſeeing theſe kind of Feavers are often terminated even by Nature her ſelf, by bleeding at the Noſe; and they do ſomtimes cauſe Frenzies, and other Inflamations: and finally, becauſe Blood-letting doth potently refrigerate, doth rather ſtop than further the Ebulition, or boyling and working of the Blood, and Choller comes away as wel as Blood when a Vein is opened; ſo that in that Maſs of Blood, which is in the greater Veins remaining, there is the ſame proportion of blood to Choller which there was before. Nay verily, when a Vein is opened, if the ſick party be any thing luſty, and the blood flow amain, only the putrid Blood which is offenſive to Nature is voided, the purer remaining in the Veins; which few Authors have taken notice of, although it be in the courſe of Practice every where obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For if the Blood flow out of the Vein drop by drop, it is the pureſt Blood, becauſe it comes out of the Vein by its own proper motion. But if it ſpring out with a forceable ſtream, it appears foul and corrupted, Nature expelling the worſer part of the Maſs of Blood. Howbeit Blood is more ſparingly to be taken from ſuch as are of a very Chollerick Conſtitution, in the middle of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers Heat, and the Dog-Daies, than in other Natures and times. But in Flegmatick and Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chollick Feavers, Blood muſt be taken away in leſſer quantity: and evermore great regard is to be had to Coindicants, and Contraindicants; foraſmuch as Quotidian Feavers do for the moſt part happen unto Children, or old Perſons in cold Countries and cold Seaſons of the yeer; which conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations do leſſen the Quantity of Blood, which otherwiſe the Diſeaſe, or its Cauſe require, ſhould be taken away. When the Feaver is cauſed by over much labor, blood muſt be taken away more ſparingly. If a Feaver happen by over great uſe of Carnal Embracements, Blood-letting is perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the time of Blood-letting, it is to be noted, That a Vein muſt not be opened pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after the Patient hath eaten; but after Digeſtion is paſt, and after the Patient hath been at ſtool. Again, Blood is to be let when the Feaver is moſt remiſs, and not in the vigor thereof, for then Nature is not able to bear both the violence of the Diſeaſe, and the loſs of Blood. As for the repletion of Blood-letting, if the ſame be neceſſary, to cauſe Evacuation, it muſt be repeated the ſame day; if for Revulſions ſake, on another day. For where Evacuation is neceſſary, eſpecially in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Diſeaſes, the Body muſt be ſuddenly changed into another condition; alſo it often happens, that a Diſeaſe is quickly paſt its firſt time or beginning, ſo that afterward we cannot ſo conveniently open a Vein. But in Revulſion we have reſpect to the motion of the Humors, which is then beſt ordered, when it is done at divers times, ſome ſpace being interpoſed, whereby Nature becomes accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to a contrary motion. For in the ſpace between Bleedings, the Blood which was ſhed into the parts regurgitates into the Veins, and by another Blood-letting is profitably drawn forth. We underſtand that Blood-letting muſt be iterated, if that blood which was firſt drawn forth, were very much corrupted; and there is reaſon to think, that there is yet a great quantity thereof abiding in the Veins.</p>
                        <p>Yea verily, Although the Blood at firſt ſeem pure, and uncorrupted, yet muſt we not deſiſt from taking the ſame away, but continue ſo doing until it appear more impure and corrupted. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that Precept delivered by <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> in his 4. <hi>de Victus Rat. in Morbis acutis,</hi> in the Cure of a Pleutiſie, may very profitably be obſerved in acute Feavers, viz. That Blood-lettings be ſo long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, til the blood change color; ſo that if at firſt corrupt blood come away, we muſt let it run till it appear more pure; and on the other ſide, if at the firſt the blood appear laudable, we muſt ſuffer to flow, til that which is impure and corrupted be come away.</p>
                        <p>Yet is there ſome diverſity to be obſerved in both Caſes. For if at firſt good Blood come away; blood ought to be again taken from the ſame Vein; that putrid blood reſiding in the innermoſt parts of the Body, may the ſooner be drawn forth. But if at firſt corrupt blood be taken away, blood is next time to be taken out of the other Arm, and afterwards out of the former again, and ſo in courſe as oft as need ſhal require.</p>
                        <p>But if the Symptomes declare, that the Putrefaction is in the inner branch of the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent; as heat and pain in the Loyns, redneſs and thickneſs of the Urine: after two or three Blood-lettings in the Arms, it wil be convenient to draw Blood out of the <hi>Vena Saphena,</hi> two or three ſeveral times.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="569" facs="tcp:49088:257"/>If in the latter Blood-lettings, ſome part of the Blood ſeem laudable, and not ſo putrid as before; it's a ſign that Nature doth repair and reſtore new good blood inſtead of the corrupt blood which hath been taken away. Contrarily, If the more is taken away, the worſe it comes, its a ſign the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe grows worſe, and that Putrefaction is encreaſed; whence there is reaſon to fear a ſtupefaction of the Internal Parts.</p>
                        <p>The Vein in the bending of the Arm, or the Baſilica, of the Mediana, is for the moſt part to be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, in the right Arm moſt commonly, ſomtimes in the left, viz. when more diſtention is felt under the ſhort Ribs on the left, than on the right ſide. Yet ſomtimes a Vein is profitably opened in the Foot, if Revulſion be neceſſary and the Patient weak, the Matter of the Diſeaſe being in the Head, and the ſick perſon moleſted with Head-ach, and want of reſt.</p>
                        <p>Frictions are ſeldom uſed in putrid Feavers, unleſs it be in the Swooning Feavers; the Cure of which we ſhall ſet down in the Cure of the Symptomes of Putrid Feavers, towards the end of the next Chapter.</p>
                        <p>But Cupping-Glaſſes are more frequently uſed, as being the Subſtitutes of Blood-letting, in whoſe ſtead they ſerve, when Weakneſs or Age of the Patient will not permit a Vein to be opened.</p>
                        <p>Medicinal Remedies are comprehended under a double kind; whereof ſome are Evacuative, others Alterative. Under the Evacuative, we comprehend Purgatives, Vomitories, Sudoroficks, and Diureticks. Under the Alterative, we comprehend Coolers, Attenuaters, Cutters, Openers, and Strengtheners. Of all which we ſhal ſet down the Compoſition and uſe in order, according to the uſual Method of Practice.</p>
                        <p>And that we may begin with Purgatives, its a great Queſtion among Authors, Whether or no they ought to be uſed in the beginning of Feavers? Which Controverſie, omitting all Circumlocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is thus determined. In reſpect of the Matter immediately producing a continual putrid Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which is contained in the greater Veins, Purgation is not convenient in the beginning; unleſs the ſaid Matter do heave and work, being ſo ſtirred by Nature, provoked by the ill quality thereof, and endeavoring to expel it, that thereby it becomes more diſpoſed for expulſion, and there be danger by the foreſaid working thereof, leſt it ruſh into ſome noble part; howbeit this ſeldom happening, for the moſt part the Concoction thereof is to be expected, before we undertake to evacuate the ſame by Purging Medicines. But in reſpect of the Matter contained in the firſt Region, if it be very much, and do encreaſe the Feaver, oppreſs Nature, and divert her from concocting of that which is in the Veins; Purgatives may be given the next day after Blood-letting, but they muſt be gentle, ſuch as evacuate only the firſt Region. Now that naughty Humors and Excrementitious do abound in the firſt Region, that is to ſay, in the Stomach, Guts, Meſentery, or about the Midrif, may be known by Stomach-ſickneſs, Bitterneſs of the Mouth, Thirſt, Pain of the Stomach, or ſome other part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the lower Belly, Looſneſs of the belly, and other Symptomes; in regard of which Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſomtimes to be practiſed before Blood-letting. Now the Medicines for this intent, muſt be Caſſia, Manna, Tamarinds, <hi>Catholicum, Electuarium lenitivum Diaprunum ſimplex, Syrupus Roſaceus, de Cichorio cum Rhabarbaro;</hi> which may divers waies be compounded after this manner:</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Caſſia newly drawn one ounce: Tamarinds half an ounce. With Sugar make it into a Bolus.</hi> Or,</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Catholicum ſix drams: Elect. lenitive, or Diaprunes ſimple, half an ounce: Cream of Tartar one dram. Make all into a Bolus.</hi> Or,</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Leaves of Endive, Cichory, Sorrel, of each half a handful: Tamarinds half an ounce: Boyl all to three ounces. In the ſtrained Liquor diſſolve Catholicum half an ounce: Manna and Syrup of Roſes, of each an ounce. Mix all into a Potion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If you deſire your Medicine a little ſtronger, you may ad a dram or four ſcruples of Rhubarb infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Endive or Cichory Water with yellow Sanders. Yea, and ſomtimes if the Feaver be not very ſtrong, two or three drams of Senna may be added to the Decoction.</p>
                        <p>Some reject Rhubarb, becauſe it heats; alſo Manna, and Syrup of Roſes, becauſe being ſweet, they are ſoon turned into Choller. But with cooling Waters or Decoctions Rhubarb being infuſed, or Manna and ſuch like diſſolved, can do no hurt; eſpecially if to the ſaid Decoctions, Tamarinds be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which are much commended to this intent, or if the Pulp thereof be given diſſolved in the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>Some in Chollerick Feavers do uſe the Whey of Goats Milk, and that very pertinently; for it tempers the heat of the Feaver, evacuates Choller, and ſtrengthens the Bowels. In a Cup of Whey they ſteep all night one dram, or one dram and an half of Rhubarb, or they add two or three ounces of Syrup of Roſes, and ſo give it in the morning; and afterward they give the Patient a quart of Whey more to drink, that all the Whey may not be infected with the taſt of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cament.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="570" facs="tcp:49088:258"/>That kind of Purgation which is practiſed in the beginning of putrid Feavers, the Vulgar Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians call Minorative purgation; and that which is practiſed when the morbifick matter is concoct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they call eradicative purgation: which is alſo convenient in the beginning (as was ſaid) in the Judgment of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> if the matter be turgent. Now this ſame turgeſcence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and boyling as it were of the matter is known hereby, becauſe the Patient perceives in divers Parts light Pains which ſoon go away and ſhift ſuddenly from place to place; and hath divers collours of the Face and other Parts, ſo that ſomtimes there is a redneſs and then again a paleneſs in ſome Part of the Face. And in a word the Patient is exceedingly tormented with anxiety and unquietneſs, continually tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and toſſing.</p>
                        <p>Howbeit that Rule of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> touching the uſe of Purgation, when the morbifick matter doth ferment and work in the Patients body, is not obſerved in ordinary Practice: but when the Humors appear in their fermentation and Motion, we do more ſafely apply our ſelves to Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letting; and by that means we do more readily preſent the ruſhing of the ſtirred Humors into any noble Part, which being agitated by the Purgation may more eaſily flow into the ſaid Parts.</p>
                        <p>Somtime alſo in the beginning of theſe Feavers Vomit is to be procured, viz. when the Patient is much vexed with illneſs of ſtomach and with vomiting for then Nature endeavours to evacuate the morbifick matter upwards, and the Phyſitian ought to aſſiſt her endeavours. And many times it falls out, that great Quantity of matter is conteined in the ſtomach and Parts thereabout, which muſt be Evacuated as ſoon as poſſible may be, by Vomit; ſeeing no concoction can be expected of ſuch excrementitious matter in ſo great a Quantity; and what ever the Patient eats or drinks is changed into ſuch a like Humor and encreaſes the Matter which is cauſe of the Diſeaſe. For <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> hath well obſerved in his third Book of the Method of Healing, Chap. 3. that all ſuperfluity of Humors in the ſtomach, ſpleen, Pancreas, Meſentery, and the Cavity of the liver; is conveniently emptied out by a Vomit, which ſomtimes wil not be removed with Medicines that work down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, though divers times adminiſtred. And it comes often to paſs, that the Matter being Vomited up, the Feaver is taken away at the firſt, which otherwiſe would have proved long, in caſe that matter had been tranſmitted into the more inner Parts of the body, and very wel mixed with the blood.</p>
                        <p>Now of the three degrees which we reckon of Vomitories, the mildeſt is to be Choſen, as Barley Water Luke-warm with Oyl of Almonds or common Oyl, or with a little Quantity of white Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar. Alſo Syrup of Vineger, or Oxymel ſimple which Chicken broath or a Decoction of Dil Seed, Raddiſh or Orach, whereunto alſo Oyl may be added. All which are to be given to the Quantity of a pint or more; for in a leſs Quantity they abide in the ſtomach. And ſeeing theſe weaker ſorts of Vomits are of little efficacy, we may ſomtimes apply our ſelves to thoſe of the middle Rank; which ſhall be propounded hereafter, in the Cure of a Tertian Ague</p>
                        <p>And not only in the beginning of the Diſeaſe before Blood-letting, but alſo the whol Courſe thereof, Clyſters muſt be given every day or every other day, if the Belly be not of it ſelf very free, made of a Decoction of Emollient and refrigerating things, ſuch as French Barley, Prunes, Mallowes, Violet Leaves, Mercury Leaves, Beares-Foot, Orach, Lettice, Endive, Houſeleek, Water-Lillies: diſſolving therein <hi>Catholicum, Caſſia,</hi> Diaprunum ſimple, Red-Sugar, Honey of Violets, and Honey of Mercury; Oyl of Water-Lillies, Violets &amp;c. But in a violent hot Feaver, it is better not to add the Oyls, becauſe they are eaſily enflamed.</p>
                        <p>Obſerve in the firſt place, that not above three or four blades of Houſeleek muſt go into one Clyſter, becauſe it cools moſt potently, and being taken in greater Quantity, may hurt the Guts.</p>
                        <p>Obſerve ſecondly, that in all Feavers of Choller, Clyſters are not to be injected actually hot, but only Blood-warm.</p>
                        <p>In Feavers that ſpring from flegm, Decoctions for Clyſters are made of the Emollient Herbs with Annis Seed, Seeds of Fennel and of Carthamus; flowers of Chamomel and Melilote; diſſolving there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Hiera Picra, Diaphoenicum, Honey of Roſes, Honey of Mercury, Oyl of Chamomel, Dil, or common Oyl.</p>
                        <p>And becauſe, as we noted before, abſolute and perfect Purgation, which they cal Eradicative, is not to be attempted till the Morbifick Cauſe be ripened and digeſted; the Phyſitian from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Diſeaſe, after the firſt Blood-letting, and when the paſſages neareſt the ſtomach are clenſed, ought to uſe ſuch Medicaments as prepare crude Humors for digeſtion and Evacuation, and withal temper the Feaveriſh Heat, hinder Putrefaction, and open obſtructions; ſuch as are Juleps, broaths, Emulſions and other things which ſhal be hereafter deſcribed.</p>
                        <p>Juleps are compounded in a Chollerick matter offending, of Syrups of Lemmons, Pomegranats, Sowr-Grapes, Vinegar ſimple, of the Juyce of Sorrel of Cichory ſimple, with Waters of Endive, Sorrel, Graſs and Cichory.</p>
                        <p>Or better, of the Decoction of the Roots of Sorrel and Cichory, of the Leaves of Sorrel, Maiden-Hair,
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:49088:258"/>
Garden Endive, Dandelion, the four cool Seeds, Tamarinds, with the Syrups aforeſaid.</p>
                        <p>And ſometimes that we may cool more effectually, a dram of <hi>Sal Prunella</hi> is added, for every Doſe of the Julep, or ſo much ſpirit of Vitriol or Sulphur, as ſhall ſuffice for a moderate ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                        <p>Sowr things are never to be omitted in Feavers ſpringing from Choller; becauſe bitter things are ſweetened by Sowr and acid things: which if they are Sowr in an high degree, as ſpirit of Vitriol and of Sulphur, they deface the bitterneſs even of Aloes and Coloquintida. Now yellow Choller being plundred of its bitterneſs, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Juleps alſo of great Virtue, may be made of Juyces and which are very grateful to the taſt, after this manner.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Juyce of Apples that ſmel ſweet, newly drawn out and ſetled four ounces: Juyce of Lem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons three ounces: Roſe-Water two ounces: Juyce of Pomegranats one ounce: fineſt Sugar half a pound: Make of al a clear Julep for three Doſes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If very thin Choller and ſharp be in motion and cauſe either a Looſneſs or ſome other greivous fluxion; Juleps muſt be compounded which thicken, of Waters of Lettice, Purſlain, Plantan, flowers of Water Lilly, Red Poppy and Violets with the Syrups aforeſaid.</p>
                        <p>Yet we muſt obſerve that Syrup of Violets and other of the ſweeter ſort of Syrups, are not to be given alone; both becauſe they looſen the ſtomach; as alſo becauſe, ere they can Paſs into the Veins, they are turned into an hot Vapor, which doth afterwards cauſe thirſt to encreaſe. And therefore there muſt evermore ſome Quantity of ſharp Syrup be mixed with the ſweet Syrups aforeſaid, that they may more eaſily peirce into the Veins, and the better reſiſt the Heat of the Feaver.</p>
                        <p>In the Progreſs of the Feaver, when Coction begins to appear, to the foreſaid Decoctions muſt be added Roots of Aſparagus and Liquoris; Leaves of Agrimony, Pimpernel, Liverwort and Maiden-Hair.</p>
                        <p>In Flegmatick and Cronick Feavers, things more cutting, attenuating and opening are preſcribed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with the more weak, ſuch as are Syrup of Vineger, of Maiden-Hair, Syrupus Bizantinus, with a Decoction of Egrimony, Maiden-Hair, Betony, Liquoris, Raiſens. And in the progreſs of the Feaver unto the former we add Syrup of the opening Roots, Vineger compound, of Hyſſop, Oxy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel ſimple, and compound. And to the Decoction we add the five opening Roots, Leaves of Hyſſop, Carduus benedictus and (if the matter be very impact, Clammy and roapy) of Germander and Centory. Whereunto if Salt of Tartar and ſpirit of Vitriol be added, they work more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily.</p>
                        <p>In Feavers ſpringing from Melancholy, ſuch things are added which do moiſten, as Syrup of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, of bugloſs, of Borrage and Apples, towards the Beginning: and afterwards Fumitory, of Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thymum, of the five opening Roots, Oxymel of Squils; with a Decoction, firſt of Bugloſs, Borrage, Cetrach or wall-fern, Maiden Hair, Fumitory, Hops; and afterward Dodder, Scordium, Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, Bark of Capers, of the Aſh-tree and of Tamarisk.</p>
                        <p>And finally in baſtard Feavers, which ariſe from the mixture of different evil Humors, the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines aforeſaid muſt be mixed together; yet ſo that ſuch as reſpect the moſt predominant Humor be put in the greateſt Quantity.</p>
                        <p>For the more nice and dainty ſoft of Patients, Medicinal broaths are preſcribed inſtead of Juleps: and alſo that the ſick may not grow weary of the ſame kind of Medicine too long uſed; and theſe broths are made of ſuch of the Roots and Herbs aforeſaid as are moſt pleaſant to the taſt with a chick, or part of an Hen of Capon: unto which ſomtimes may be added one dram of <hi>Sal Prunella,</hi> or ſome drops of ſpirit of Vitriol, when we would have it more cooling than ordinary.</p>
                        <p>Howbeit in ſlow and long laſting Feavers, cauſed by rebellious obſtructions hard to be cleared, Germander though bitter and Cichory, Endive and Dandelyon, though bitter, may be boyled in Broaths; and <hi>Montanus</hi> in his Counſels, doth cry up Cichory and Germander boyled in Broaths as an admirable Remedy for ſuch as have a long Feaver with obſtructions.</p>
                        <p>In Feavers from flegm a Decoction of Chamomel is excellent. <hi>Zacutus Luſitanus.</hi> Obſervat. 26. in the third Book of his <hi>Praxis admiranda.</hi>

                        <p>Alſo emulſions or Almond-Milks are very good in putrid Feavers, and are commonly more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing than Juleps. They are moſt in uſe when the Feaver is Joyned with a dry diſtemper of the Bowels, or a thin Catarrh, or an Inflamation of the Lungs and Parts ſerving to breath withal; or for variety, leaſt the Patient ſhould be over tired with continual uſe of Juleps. Now the Compoſition of theſe emulſions, hath been deſcribed in the foregoing cures.</p>
                        <p>Cold Water given in great Quantity in continual putrid Feavers, was wont to be in uſe among the antients, and is commended by very many latter Phyſitians. But as we ſaid the uſe here of was dangerous in the ſimple <hi>Synochus;</hi> ſo in this Caſe, we think the diſcreet Phyſitian ſhal do beſt to for bear the ſame, for the reaſons we delivered, in our Chapter of the ſimple <hi>Synochus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Yet will it be ſomtimes good, in extream heat of a Feaver to give a good draught of cold Water,
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:49088:259"/>
to ten or twelve ounces with a few drops of Spirit of Vitriol: For hereby ſomtimes the ſame effects are wrought, which <hi>Galen</hi> attributes to cold Water being drunk, the quantity of three or four pints at a time; When as notwithſtanding there are none of thoſe dangers to be feared, which <hi>Galen</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf confeſſeth did ſomtimes happen upon the prepoſterous drinking down of ſo great a quantity of cold Water as he adviſeth. For the Spirit of Vitriol cauſeth that the Water breeds no Obſtructions, but rather opens the ſame, quickly piercing and paſſing through the Bowels, not biding in the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondria's as plain and ſingle cold Water is wont to do; but is very like the acid Mineral Fountains and Wells, which though they are drunk in great quantity, do not lie heavy in the parts about the ſhort Ribs, but are quickly piſſed forth, and very good againſt Obſtructions.</p>
                        <p>To ſtrengthen Nature, which in every violent Feaver is much dejected, Electuaries are good, and ſtrengthening Conſerves and Preſerves, compounded of Conſerve of Roots of Bugloſs, Leaves of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, Wood-ſorrel, Stalks of Lettice, Flowers of Bugloſs, Borrage, Violet, Cichory, and Roſes, Pulp of Citrons.

                        <p>For the more dainty and nice ſort of People, in great debility of Natural ſtrength, this following Julep very pleaſant to the taſt may be compounded:</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Waters of Sorrel, Orange flower, and Roſes, of each one ounce and an half: Syrup of Lemmons and Pomegranates, of each one ounce: Confectio Alkermes one dram: mix them. Let the Patient take hereof frequently in a spoon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Altering Medicines having been uſed for ſome daies together, and ſuch as prepare bad Humors, when the Feaver begins to decline, we muſt ſet our ſelves to purge out the ſaid Humors, when the ſigns of Concoction do appear, avoiding the Critical daies. And this muſt be done with Medicines a little ſtronger than thoſe which were given at the beginning; of which ſort are, Senna, Rhubarb, Agarick, Catholicum duplex, and ſuch like; whoſe Matter and Doſe muſt by the skilful Phyſitian be accommodated to the Humors offending, and the Nature of the Patient. And ſome Phyſitians are ſo bold as to proceed to Scammoniate Medicaments, as <hi>Diaprunum ſolutivum, Diaphoenicon, Electuarium de ſucco, Roſarum &amp; Diacarthamum.</hi> Which notwithſtanding are very ſeldom to be uſed in continual Feavers, becauſe Scammony is wont very much to inflame the Humors, and to cauſe vehement thirſt; and that eſpecially in burning Feavers, in which Scammoniate Medicaments are very hurtful. Yea verily, and Rhubarb it ſelf, although a gentle and moſt excellent Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is by ſome ſuſpected as not ſafe in very Chollerick Feavers, becauſe of its notable heating and drying faculty. Howbeit the hurtful faculty thereof may in great part be corrected, by infuſing the ſame in Cooling Waters, and by mingling therewith a Decoction of Tamarinds and cooling Herbs; and by adding thereto Caſſia, Syrup of Roſes, Syrup of Cichory with Rhubarb, and ſuch like.</p>
                        <p>If the Feaver do ſtil continue, Purgation muſt be ever and anon repeated, uſing between whiles pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratives &amp; digeſtives, til the whol ſeminary of evil humors be taken away. For otherwiſe, if we ceaſe Purging before the Feaver be perferctly abated and gone; the Patient wil be in danger of a Relapſe. Yet this Rule needs ſome reſtriction. For if after many Purgations, a lingring feaver continues, which doth by little and little pine the Patients, and ſeem to caſt them into a Conſumption; it will be the beſt courſe to leave Purging, and ſeek to conquer the Feaver only by Alteratives and Dier. For it ſomtimes falls out, when there is ſome evil diſpoſition of the Bowels, cauſing a protraction of the Feaver, that ſo long as Medicaments are given, ſo long the Diſeaſe continues, becauſe that Nature is weakened. Which afterwards (Purgation being omitted) gathers ſtrength, concocts the Cauſe of the Diſeaſe, and being concocted, expels the ſame.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="573" facs="tcp:49088:259"/>But if a lingring Feaver ariſe from Obſtructions, as is often ſeen in Children, frequent and very gentle Purging, which draws away the Humors by little and little, is wont to remove the Diſeaſe; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if the Purgation be compounded with Rhubarb, which both opens obſtructions, and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens the bowels. The Commendations whereof celebrated by <hi>Montanus</hi> in his tenth Counſel of Feavers, is worthy to be ſet down in this place. He ſetting down the Cure of a Boy that had a lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring Feaver ariſing from Obſtructions: <hi>Among other things, I ſhall commend</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>one which I have by long Experience found never to fail, viz. That he take every day the Infuſion of Rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb in Endive Water. For I never knew Feaver from Obſtructions, which was not cured by this Medicament, provided it were conſtantly taken without wearineſs, or giving over. For I have ſomtimes ſeen moſt groſs Humors impacted into the narrow paſſages of the Body, and ſuch Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as by reaſon of the weakneſs of Natural heat could hardly be removed, cured by Rhubarb. My Courſe therefore hath been to take one pint of Endive Water, and therein to infuſe a dram of Rhubarb tied in a thin piece of Linnen. Of which Infuſion, having lightly preſſed out the Rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb, I give four ounces in the morning; and this is the Doſe for Children. Neither do I ceaſe gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging this Medicament, until I ſee the Feaver and Obſtructions wholly gone. For they will doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs be cured, if all other things be rightly ordered, and ſuitable to the Cure.</hi> So far <hi>Montanus.</hi> But we are wont ordinarily to uſe a Diet Drink made with Rhubarb, which to ſuch Children as are troubled with a lingring Feaver and Obſtructions, I am wont to give for their ordinary Drink with good ſucceſs. It is thus made: Half a dram or a dram of Rhubarb (according as the Child can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the taſt thereof) groſly poudered and tied in a Rag, is infuſed in two or three pints of ſmal Beer or Ale an whol day, cold: Of this the Child drinks for a month together, or longer if the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſs of the Diſeaſe require the ſame. Whereunto, if the Feaver be very remiſs, and the Child flegmatick, a little Wine, or ſtronger Beer or Ale may ſomtimes be added, to qualifie the unpleaſing taſt of the Rhubarb.</p>
                        <p>After Purgation of the Morbifick Matter, Nature is for the moſt part accuſtomed in the declinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Diſeaſe, to purge away the reliques of the Matter offending by Urine, which we may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, becauſe the Urines are then more thick, or more plentiful than ordinary; which endeavor of Nature muſt be aſſiſted by Diuretick Medicaments which are moſt temperate, ſuch as are Emulſions, and the Openers formerly ſet down in Juleps or Broths; whereunto, if the Feaver be very gentle, ſome Roots of Fennel and Parſley, or Leaves of Wormwood, may be added, and that eſpecially in Feavers of Flegm, and continual Quotidians.</p>
                        <p>But if Nature do expel the Reliques of the Morbifick Matter to the habit of the Body, Sudoroficks are to be uſed; not thoſe hot ones, which are more properly called Sudoroficks; but others more temperate, which are the ſame in a manner with the Diureticks, and being of an attenuating faculty, do diſpoſe the Humors in ſuch ſort, as Nature may more eaſily expel them by what place or way ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe is moſt enclined. Howbeit, to theſe may be added, Carduus Water, Spirit of Vitriol, and other things which ſhall be more fully deſcribed, when we ſhall treat of Malignant Feavers.</p>
                        <p>Beſides inward Medicaments, divers things are alſo outwardly applied, to temperate the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh heat, to confirm the ſtrength of the principal parts, or to open the Pores of the Skin, and draw out the ſmoaky Vapors, and Feaveriſh Heat: viz. Epithems, Liniments, and other things to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied unto the Region of the Heart, Liver, and other parts. Which are invented to mitigate the Heat, and are not to be applied ſave in the ſtate or declination of the Diſeaſe, when the Heat diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it ſelf to the exterior parts; not in the beginning or augment, while it reſides yet about the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels; nor yet when the Criſis is at hand.</p>
                        <p>An Epithem to be applied to the Region of the Heart may be thus compounded.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>the Waters of Bugloſs, Sorrel, Water-lillies, Roſes, of each three ounces: Vinegar of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or juyce of Lemmons one ounce: the Pouders of Diamargaritum frigidum, and Triaſantalon; of each one dram: Camphire and Saffron, of each five grains: mix all.

                        <p>Take <hi>Juyce of Cichory and Endive of each half a pound, Juyce of Lettice and Vinegar of Roſes of each two ounces: Pouder Triaſantalon two drams: Mix all and make thereof an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pithem.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now it is very profitable to apply cooling Epithems not only to the Liver, but to the whol Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Hypochondriaes; for they do not only further Coction, but alſo help the diſtemper of the bowels; and hinder the principal Parts from a deadly Conſumption.</p>
                        <p>The Region of the Liver may likewiſe be anointed with this following Oyntment, which alſo may be applied to the Reins and Loins.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Oyntment of Roſes one ounce and an half: Ceratum Santalinum one ounce: Juyce of Endive one ounce and an half: Oyl of Roſes and Wax, as much as ſhall ſuffice, to make a Lini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Whereunto add a little Vinegar of Roſes, at the time of anointing.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Alſo cooling things are profitably applied to the ſtones becauſe of the great conſent between them and the principal parts of the body; they therfore being cooled, the heat of the whol body is in great meaſure extinguiſhed. To which purpoſe ſuch an Epithem as this following may be made.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Waters of waterlilly, Plantain, Roſes, and Cichory of each three ounces. Vineger of Roſes one ounce and half. White wine two ounces. Mix all and dip a cloath therein cold, and warp the ſame about the Stones.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Alſo the cooling of the hands and feet doth great good, becauſe of the Conſent they have with the whol body, by reaſon of the Arteries Veins and Nerves, which end in thoſe parts.</p>
                        <p>Neither need we fear leaſt it ſhould hinder the voidance of excrements by the pores, becauſe they are few that come that way; ſo that there comes more good than hurt by the cooling of thoſe parts.</p>
                        <p>The Patients may therefore hold in their hands balls of marble, Ivory, Brafs or Lead. Or they may hold their hands in cold Water, with a little Wine and Vineger mingled therewith. To the ſoales of their Feet may be applied the Leaves of Lettice, of Water Lilly, wet in Water and Vineger Or to waſh both, Hands and Feet, the following Decoction may be provided.</p>
                        <p>Take Leaves of Lettice, Violets, Houſe-Leek, Purſlain; Vine Leaves, and Willow-Leaves of each one handful. Heads or Leaves of Poppy (if the Patient reſt not) an handful: Vineger one ounce: white Wine two ounces: Fountain Water as much as ſhal ſuffice. Make of al a Decoction. Hereunto may be added, if you pleaſe, a little Quantity of Lie, for to ſtrengthen the Joynts. Herewith let the Hands and Arms, the Legs and Thighs of the Patient be waſhed warm, twice in a day, or once at bed time.</p>
                        <p>We are furthermore to note, that the Antients frequently uſed baths of freſh Water to cure pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid Feavers, as we may ſee in <hi>Galen</hi> in his Book <hi>de Marcore. Cap.</hi> 7. and in the 11. of his Method Chap. 9. and 20. and in his 1. to <hi>Glauco</hi> Chap. 9. and thoſe baths were either cold in a vehement Feaver ſuch as is an exquiſite burning Feaver; or Blood warm in the declination of Feavers when the ſigns of Concoction appeared. But in this Age of ours, theſe kind of baths cannot be uſed, without danger, and they are convenient only in one Caſe; viz. when the Feavers become very laſting and poſſeſſing a body hot and dry and lean, ſeems likely to turn to an Hectick.</p>
                        <p>And onething yet more I ſhal ad for a Concluſion of all, that if the Feaver terminate with ſome Criſis, the reliques of the Morbifick matter, muſt be taken away with a Purge; eſpecially if the Criſis were by way of Sweat or bleeding. For by thoſe Evacuations only the thinner portion of the matter is voided forth, but the thicker being left behind, as afreſh inflamed and brings the Patient into a Relaps. Only therefore that Critical Evacuation which is wont to proceed by way of Stool, is ſecure from a Relaps. Yet muſt we not ſo confide therein as to abſtain uſually from al Purgation. For the Parts about the Midriff are yet foul, and do corrupt the nutriment which comes into thoſe Quarters, from whence proceeds either a relapſe into the former, or ſome new Diſeaſe. Therefore it is for the beſt way (as ſome latter Phyſitians have obſerved) by repeating once and again a gentle Purge, ſo to clenſe away al the remainders of the morbifick Cauſe, that all fear of a Relapſe and al occaſion of another Diſeaſe may be taken away.</p>

                           <hi>Chap. 2.</hi> Of the Symptomes which accompany Putrid Feavers.</head>
                        <p>ALL Authours in a manner who have writ of Feavers, have deſcribed thoſe Symptoms which either accompany or follow upon them, with their Cures at the end of their work, that ſo they might be beſt accommodated to al kinds of Feavers. Which Counſel of their though I ſhal not diſallow, yet I have thought it much more commodious for the ſervice of Practitioners, to Joyn them immediately after the Doctrin of putrid Feavers, ſeeing in thoſe kind of Feavers they are wont to be moſt vehement and frequent, and require peculiar Remedies.</p>
                        <p>So that although very many Symptoms are wont to be Cured by the Remedies aforeſaid, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to the Cauſe and the Diſeaſe: yet very many there are more offenſive than the Diſeaſe it ſelf, which are here breifly to be diſcribed.</p>
                        <p>Head-ach, Want of Sleep and Ravings, are Cured in a manner with the ſelf ſame remedies viz. Revellers, repellers, derivers, reſolvers and anodines. Revellers are emollient Clyſters and ſuch as are Laxative, Gentle Purgations, Blood-letting, Cupping-Glaſſes, and waſhing the Feet. Repellers are frontals, Vinegars, Roſes, Unguents. Or Liniments; Derivers are opening of the forehead Vein, and Veſicatories. Reſolvers are certain Oyls, and certain Live Creatures applied to the Head, which likewiſe are Anodines. And while the foreſaid Remedies are uſed, Juleps are given and Emulſions, to temper and qualifie hot and ſharp Humors. After all theſe come narcotick Medicines, which are not to be uſed, but upon extream neceſſity when other things wil do no good. The matter of al which Medicaments, is ſet down in our Chapters of the Phrenſy and Head-ach proceeding from an hot Cauſe. But in the adminiſtration of the ſaid Medicaments, one thing muſt be diligently noted, that they be not to be uſed, when the Criſis of the Feaver is near: for they would then diſturb the motion of Nature and hinder the Criſis. Which is to be underſtood as of al the reſt, ſo more eſpecially of the narcoticks.</p>
                        <p>Againſt want of ſleep and Ravings, a Cataplaſm laid to the Soals of the Feet wil be very good, being made of freſh gourds beaten, the Leaves of the larger HouſeLeek, of Lettice and ſuch like. As alſo to waſh the Feet with a Decoction of refrigerating Herbs. For by this means the Coldneſs is communicated through the Nerves unto the Brain.</p>
                        <p>Convulſions in Feavers, eſpecially Malignant ones, do ſomtimes happen, by reaſon of Malignant Vapors which vex and fret the Skins which cover the Brain called Meninges. Againſt which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion fits we muſt uſe revelling Clyſters and Cupping-Glaſſes; alſo often give in Juleps or broaths Epileptick Pouders and finally anoint the Patients Back-bone with Oyl of Chamomel, Violets, Sweet Almonds and of the Jndian Nut.</p>
                        <p>When profound ſleep happens to ſuch as are in Feavers the ſame Remedies are given which have been deſcribed in the Cure of ſleepy Diſeaſes, only obſerving this one thing; that we give no very hot Medicine inward.</p>
                        <p>The thirſt of Perſons Feaveriſh is cheifly allaied with refrigerating and moiſtening drinks. But if thirſt be ſo Violent that moderate drinking cannot aſſwage it (and to drink over much doth much hurt and oft times endangers the Patients Life) we muſt by other means deceive and aſſwage the ſame.</p>
                        <p>Firſt therefore, let the Patients draw in the cold Air, and abide in Silence not ſpeaking a word, let them keep their mouths cloſe and breath through their Noſtrils, and give themſelves to ſleep.</p>
                        <p>Let them waſh their mouths with Barley Water Blood-warm, or with Water wherein hath been boyled Jujubees, Sebeſtens, Prunes, Lettice, Purſlain and ſuch like.</p>
                        <p>Let them hold in their Mouths a peice of Liquoris Scraped and ſteeped in Vineger and Water, or let them waſh their Mouths with Barley Water either ſimple or with a little Vineger in it, or a little Juyce of Lemons, Pomegranats, or a little ſpirit of Vitriol.</p>
                        <p>Or let them hold in their mouths the Kernels of Pomegranats, or a Slice of a Citron, or a Lemmon, or an Orange, Steeped in Roſe-Water with Sugar; or Stalks of Lettice, Endive, or Purſlain; Leaves of Sorrel, Bits of a Gourd, Cowcumber or Melon firſt Steeped in cold Water; Or Acid Cherries, or red Currence, or Reſ-berries, or Tamarinds, or a peice of Chryſtal, or the Stones of ſharp Prunes upon which a little of the Pap Hangs, and ſuch like.</p>
                        <p>Alſo Sugar Diſſolved in Roſe-Water with a little ſpirit of Vitriol, and dried again, is very good to quench thirſt.</p>
                        <p>If thirſt cannot be taken away with theſe lighter things they muſt be permitted to drink, not in the beginnings of the Exacerbations, or fits nor in the Augment, but very ſpareingly, but in the Vigor and eſpecially when it is towards declining: for then large allowance of drink doth carry the heat out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:49088:261"/>
and ſomtimes moves ſweat; eſpecially in the fits of Agues, in the declination of which, it is many times good for the Patient to drink unto ſatiety. Several Materials convenient to make Drinks in theſe kind of Feavers, are ſet down in the foregoing Chapter.</p>
                        <p>But if thirſt be cauſed by a Chollerick Humor contained in the Stomach, the ſaid Humor muſt be voided by Vomit or Stool. Vomit may be procured, if the Patient be Stomach-ſick, with an ounce and an half of Syrup of Vinegar Simple, with five ounces of Barley Water, or of the Decoction of Rhadiſhes. If that will not do, purge the Patient with a Bolus of one ounce of the pulp of Caſſia, and three drams of the pulp of Tamarinds, or with two ounces of Manna, diſſolved in a Decoction of Prunes or Tamarinds; or the following Potion may be given.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Caſſia new drawn ſix drams: Mucilage of the ſeeds of Flea-bane half an ounce: the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Barley, Prunes, and Tamarinds, four ounces: Syrup of Roſes one ounce. Mix all into a Potion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Heat, Dryneſs, and Roughneſs of the Tongue and Throat, is cured by divers Remedies, ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>applied to thoſe parts, and contained in the mouth, compounded after this manner:</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>of the Mucilage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Quince ſeeds one ounce: the ſeeds of Mallows half an ounce: Pouder of Diatragacanthum frigidum, and Sugar Candy, of each one dram: white Sugar, as much as ſhall ſuffice. Make of all a Lohoch.</hi> Or,</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>of the Mucilage of Fleabane ſeeds, or Quince ſeeds extracted with Roſe Water, or Lettice Water half an ounce: Syrup of Violets, Lemmons, or Pomegranates, an ounce and an half: mix them. Let the Patients take now and then a little, and bold it in their mouths.</hi> Or,</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Cucumer ſeeds half an ounce: Quince ſeeds two drams: Gum Tragacanth one dram and an half: Beat the ſeeds and diſſolve the Gums in the white of an Egg. Mix all, and make thereof little Cakes, for the Patients to hold in their mouths.</hi> Or,</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Seeds of Fleabane, and of Quinces, of each one dram and an half: Gum Tragacanth half a dram: Sugar Candy three drams. With Mucilage of Gum Tragacanth make all into little Cakes. Or with a thin Rag make Nodules, which ſhall be ſteeped in Roſe Water, and held in the Patients Mouth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If the roughneſs be very hard to remove, make a Gargariſm of the Decoction of Barley, Roots of Marſh-mallows, Leaves of Lettice, Purſlain, Violet flowers, adding thereto Honey of Roſes, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of Violets, or Sugar Candy, or Oxymel ſimple, and ſuch like.</p>
                        <p>If filth cleaves to the Tongue, as it moſt times happens, it muſt be oftentimes wiped with a rough Cloth dipped in a mixture of Water and Vinegar. Whereunto alſo ſomtimes may be added, the Juyce of Houſleek, and Sal prunella.</p>
                        <p>If the Heat be more vehement, with great blackneſs of the Tongue, more refrigerating Medicines muſt be mixt with the moiſtening ones, after this manner:</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Juyce of Lettice, Houſleek, and Lemmons, of each an ounce: Mucilage of Quince ſeeds and Sugar Candy, of each half an ounce: white Sugar as much as ſhall ſuffice. Make all into a Lohoch.</hi> Or,</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Green Houſleek one handful: Vinegar of Roſes three ounces: Barley Water one pint: Boyl all till the third part be waſted away. In the ſtrained Liquor diſſolve of Sal prunella one dram and an half: Allum a ſcruple: Syrup of Violets and Mulberries, of each one ounce: Make of all a Gargariſm. Or Sal prunella alone may be diſſolved in Houſleek Water, and the Tongue and Throat waſhed therewith, which is very good; alſo ſome Portion thereof may be ſwallowed to cool the mouth of the Stomach, when it is likewiſe inflamed.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Alſo outwardly; let the Neck and Throat be anointed with Oyl of Violets, and freſh butter, waſhed in Roſe Water, with which the Throat being as it were ſcorched and parched, may be moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened.</p>
                        <p>For Cooling, the Oyntment of Roſes, and <hi>Galens</hi> cooling Oyntment may be uſed, with others of like Nature. But the Leaves of Lettice and Purſlain being bruiſed and encloſed between two Linnen Cloths, and ſo applied to the Neck and Throat, are much more effectual. Alſo thoſe kind of Bugs which we call Sows, may be bruiſed and laid on in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                        <p>In great Heat of the Breaſt, ſuch as is wont to happen in Feavers, the whol Breaſt muſt be anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Oyl of Violets, Water-lillies, and of ſweet Almonds. Yea, and if the Heat be very vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Fomentations ought to be applied to the ſaid part made of a Decoction of French barley, Lettice, Water-Lillies, Borrage, Violets, and ſuch like; after which, irrigations ought to be uſed of the Oyls aforeſaid. Seeing that, according to the Preſcript of <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Avicenna,</hi> in ſuch like Feavers, great care is to be had of the breaſt, as of the Furnace of Heat. Now theſe kind of Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, according to the Rule of <hi>Trallianus,</hi> are ſeldom to be cold, becauſe they drive the Heat inward; nor luke-warm, becauſe they relax; but ſuch things ought to be applied to the breaſt, as are actually hot, and potentially cold.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="577" facs="tcp:49088:261"/>Pain in the Loyns is cauſed in Feavers by hot and plentiful blood boyling and working in the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> and it muſt be eaſed by Emollient Clyſters and Cooling, and Emulſions made of the Cold Seeds, adding Sal Prunella; and by anointing the Loyns with <hi>Galens</hi> Cooling Oyntment, with Juyce of the larger Houſleek, and Camphire, or <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum Populeon,</hi> or Oyl of Roſes, Lillies, and Poppies; or with an Epithem made of Plantane Water, Roſe Water, Vinegar of Roſes, and Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire; or with a Mixture of Roſe Water, Oyl of Roſes, and Vinegar: all which are to be applied actually cold in the Summer, and a little leſs than blood-warm at other Seaſons of the Yeer.</p>
                        <p>Diſquietneſs, and tumblings, and toſſings, which are wont to happen in the Feaver <hi>Aſſodes,</hi> and in the Fits of a Tertian Ague, are beſt cured by purging away the Chollerick Humor which vexes and frets upon the Stomach, and other ſenſible parts, and that by Vomit or Stool, according as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſeems more or leſs to affect the one or other way; alſo it may be drawn downwards by Clyſters, and preſently all Art is to be uſed to make the Patient reſt, and cold Drink is given, as alſo cooling Juleps, whereunto ſomtimes Syrup of Poppies, or a little Laudanum may profitably be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                        <p>Swooning Fits are wont to happen in thoſe kind of Feavers which are commonly called <hi>Febres Syncopales,</hi> or Swooning Feavers, of which there are two kinds, as was ſaid before; and the one is called <hi>Minuta,</hi> the other <hi>Humoroſa.</hi> The Cure of which Feavers, much differing from the Cure of other Putrid Feavers, we have reſerved unto this place, in regard of the ſaid Symptome of Swooning.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Minuta Syncopalis,</hi> which is bred of Chollerick Humors, ſharp and venemous, muſt be cured after this manner. Let the Air be cold and moiſt, and a little aſtringent, that diſſipation of the ſubſtance of the Body, may be thereby prevented. Let the Patients Diet be thin, cooling, and reſtorative, of the Broth of Chickens boyled with Sorrel, Purſlain, &amp;c. To which may be added, Roſe-water, Juyce of Pomegranates, and a little Sugar. Bread ſteeped in the Juyce of Pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates, or of Oranges may be given, if a more liberal Diet is to be granted, as alſo Cream of Barley, or Panada's with Juyce of Lemmons or Pomegranates. Alſo Reſtorative Broths of preſſed Fleſh with the foreſaid Juyces. To the ſtronger ſort are given the Yolks of Eggs with Juyce of ſowr Grapes, the Stones of Cocks, the Fleſh of Pullets, Hens, Partridges, qualified with the aforeſaid Juyces.</p>
                        <p>Let the Patients drink with their Meat, if they have no Inflamation of any bowel, thin Wine not very old, nor yet new and windy; or Beer that is indifferent ſtrong, not new, or very ſtale. When they eat not, or otherwiſe if there be Inflamation, let their Drink be Barley Water, or Water in which a piece of a Loaf hath been boyled, with Syrup of Pomegranates, Lemmons, Citrons, Julep of Roſes, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Sleep is good out of the Paroxyſm, but in the ſame it hurts. And finally, ſpecial Care muſt be taken that nothing provoke the Patient to Anger, Sadneſs, and the like Paſſions.</p>
                        <p>In the Paroxyſm, Reſolution of the Spirits muſt be prevented by blowing cool Air with Fans up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Patients, and by ſprinkling them with ſweet ſmelling Waters. Their Face muſt be ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with cold Water, or Water of Roſes, and Vinegar minled. With which the Stones of Men, and the Dugs of Women muſt be bathed cold.</p>
                        <p>If Heat and Spirits will not be revoked from the Heart to the outward Parts of the Body, it is to be revelled and forced back by binding of the extream Parts, and by nipping and pinching them; alſo pluck the Patients often by the Noſe, pluck them by their Hair, and call upon them often by their Chriſten Name. Give of the Crum of White-bread ſteeped in the Juyce of Pomegranates, of thin fragrant Wine, tempered with Roſe-Water; and when neceſſity urges, ſome Cinnamon Water min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with Roſe Water. In the mean ſpace, Reſtorative Broths are not to be omitted, wherewith Confectio Alkermes, and ſuch like may be mingled. Alſo Cordial Potions are often to be given out of a Spoon, made after this manner:</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Water of Roſes two ounces: Orange flower Water one ounce: Cinnamon Water half an ounce: Confectio Alkermes one dram: Pearls prepared, and Coral prepared, of each half a ſcruple: Sugar Cakes made with Pearl ſix drams: Mix all, and make thereof a Julep, or Cordial Potion. To theſe may be added the Electuaries, and Conſerves, and Preſerves, deſcribed in the foregoing Chapter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Alſo the inner ſide of a Loaf hot out of the Oven ſprinkled with Roſe water and Vinegar, may be applied to the Patients Noſtrils, and Mouth.</p>
                        <p>To the Heart, Cooling and ſtrengthening Epithems may be applied.</p>
                        <p>To ſtraiten the Pores, and prevent the Evaporation of the Patients ſtrength and Spirits, wrap them in Linnen ſprinkled with Pouder of Roſes, Balauſtians, and Sanders; or let their ſhifts be ſprinkled with Roſe water, and a little Vinegar.</p>
                        <p>Let their whol Body, eſpecially the Back be anointed with this following Liniment.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Oyl made of unripe Olives, one ounce and an half: Mirtles, Quinces, and Mucilage of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                              <pb n="578" facs="tcp:49088:262"/>
Seeds of Flea-bane, of each ſix drams: Gum Arabick diſſolved in Roſe-Water two drams, white Wax as much as ſhal ſuffice make all into a Liniment.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A ſpecial regard is to be had of the ſtomach, becauſe the Humor offending is cheifly there collected. Now the region there of muſt be anointed with Oyl of Roſes and Quinces: and then alſo may be laid on a Toaſt of Bread, wet in Juyce of Quinces and unripe Pomegranats. Or if it be afflicted with great heat, ſoment the ſtomach blood-warm, with a Decoction of Purſlain and Roſes, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> with Juyce of Night-ſhade, Purſlain, Sowr-Grapes adding thereto Oyl of Roſes and Quinces.</p>
                        <p>The Swooning Fits being removed and the Patient ſtrengthened, we muſt bend our minds to remove the Feaver and its Cauſe. Which may be done, by Alteratives and Evacuators proper for turning Feavers, which we have deſcribed in their proper place: viz. Where the Cure of burning Feavers is ſet down.</p>
                        <p>The Cure of the ſecond ſort of Swooning Feavers, which is called <hi>Febris Syncopolis Humoroſa,</hi> which is cauſed by abundance of Flegmatick and crude Humors, is in a manner contrary to the Cure of the <hi>Minuta</hi> newly deſcribed. For the Air ought to be temperate, inclining to heat, light, pure and dry. Meats, of good Juyce eaſily digeſted, prepard with Hyſſop, Fennel and ſuch like Herbs. Let their drink be thin and not very ſtrong. Let their ſleep and Watchings be Moderate.</p>
                        <p>But Frictions or artificial Rubbings of the Body, and by <hi>Galen</hi> much extolled in this Caſe. In the 12. Method Cap. 3. They muſt be uſed from the beginning of the Diſeaſe, with Courſe Cloaths, beginning above and ſo Rubbing downwards; firſt on the Thighs and Legs; afterwards on the Arms, ſhoulders and Back. Let the Cloaths with which the Frictions are performed be firſt Smoaked with Storax, <hi>Lignum Aloes,</hi> Frank-Incenſe Cloves &amp;c. When after friction the Limbs are luſtily warm, anoint them with Oyl of Dil, of Chamomel, of Orice, of Caſtus and others of a reſolving Faculty. Such Frictions as theſe are highly commended, becauſe they call the natural Heat and ſpirits together with the Humor offending which did Choak the natural ſtrength, into the outward Parts.</p>
                        <p>In the fit the Sick-party muſt be rowzed, by pulling the Noſe, Rubbing the Eares, plucking off of Hairs, Loud calling &amp;c. Alſo ſweet Smelling things muſt be Applied to the Mouth and Noſtrils; as Cinnamon and Orange flower Water, Vinegar wherein Cloves have been ſteeped, inſide of a white Loaf dipt in <hi>Hippocras</hi> alone, or Cinnamon Water, or the following cordial Water.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Waters of Bawm, Roſe-Mary and Orange flowers of each one ounce; Cinnamon Water half an Ounce:</hi> Confectio Alkermes <hi>one dram: Syrup of preſerved Citron Peels and of Gilly-flowers of each one ounce: Mix all into a potion or Julep, which the Patient muſt often take of, by a Spoonful at a time. Alſo Electuaries may be made after this manner.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Conſerve of flowers of Bugloſs, Roſemary, and of Citron Peels preſerved, of each half an ounce: preſerved Nutmeg three drams:</hi> Conſectio Alkermes <hi>two drams: Species of Diambra and Diamoſchum dulce of each one ſcruple: With the Syrup of preſerved Citron Peels, make all into an Electuary.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Unto the Heart Epithems may be applied and young Pidgeons to the ſtomach and Stones; Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations may be applied, and other things adminiſtred, which have been propounded in caſe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of ſtrength.</p>
                        <p>While theſe things are in doing, frictions muſt ever and anon repeated, which muſt in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe never be omitted.</p>
                        <p>When the Patient hath a little gathered ſtrength, the Morbifick Matter is to be drawn out by Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Purgations (in which <hi>Hiera cum Agarico,</hi> in regard of the ſtomach, is very profitable) which ought to be gentle and frequent, yet ſo as fitting Preparatives be adminiſtred between Purge and Purge.</p>
                        <p>Want of Appetite is common in a Manner to al Feavers: for when the ſtomach is inflamed, thirſt is encreaſed, but Appetite of eating diminiſhed. Yet ſomtimes Appetite is ſo dejected that the Patients can hardly ſup a little broath. Which Loathing of Meat is cauſed by Vicious Humors collected in the ſtomach or ſoaked into the coats thereof; or of corrupt and Malignant Vapors which infeſt the ſtomach. It ought to be Cured by Evacuation of the Morbifick Matter by Vomit or Stool, and firſt with an infuſion of Rhubarb and Tamarinds. But in the declination, if the Feaver be not ſtrong, with <hi>Hiera Picra</hi> diſſolved in a Decoction of Barley, Vetches, Wormwood and other detergent things. Afterwards we muſt uſe Clyſters, which occaſionally do revel from the ſtomach. Alſo acid and refrigerating things are frequently to be given, as Syrup of lemmons, Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granats, ſome Cherries &amp;c. given alone or with cold Water. In the declination or when the Feaver ceaſes, Syrup of Roman Wormwood may pofitably be given, either alone or mixed with acid Juyces or Syrups. Let Meats that are grateful be preſented to the ſick. For as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> teaches in Aphor. 38. Sect. 2. The Pleaſanter Meat and drink, though ſomwhat the Worſe, is to be preferred before that which is bitter and not ſo pleaſant. Alſo let them eat but little and ſeldom, for much
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:49088:262"/>
and frequent eating cauſes Want of Appetite even in thoſe which are wel. And let their Meats be ſauced (provided they have no cough) with Juyce of unripe Grapes, Vinegar of Roſes and Juyce of Lemmons. If the ſick do ſo abhorer al Meats that they can take nothing at al, let them have nouriſhing Clyſters given them twice or thrice in a day; the excrements being firſt avoided by a clenſing Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. When the Feaver is wholly allaied and gone, if want of Appetite do remain, let the ſick perſon Moderately excerciſe, and uſe Capers, Saxifrage, Olives; let him change place and go into a colder Air. And finally if theſe helps ſuffice not let the Patient uſe Wormwood Wine and pils of <hi>Hiera Picra,</hi> which do powerfully clenſe away ſuch Humors as are faſt ſticking in the Coats of the ſtomach.</p>
                        <p>Hiccupings and Vomitings which betide perſons in Feavers are oppoſed by divers Medicaments, the materials whereof are to be ſought for in our cures of thoſe Infirmities of Vomiting &amp; Hiconping &amp; to be Judicially accomodated to ſuch perſons as in Feavers are troubled with thoſe Symptomes. But ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al care is to be taken that a critical Vomiting be by no Means ſtopped. Hiccoughing ſomtimes proceeds from immoderate uſe of refrigerating things, as <hi>Lemnius</hi> witneſſes, whoſe words <hi>Schenkius</hi> doth thus relate. <hi>Hiccoughing in Feavers doth ſomtimes follow over abundant uſe of Refrigerating Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leps; and I have ſeen many ſo affected by the unadviſed Raſhneſs of Phyſitians, which Symptom contrary to the expectation of all Men, I Cured by giving the Patient Wine to drink.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A Looſneſs befalling one that hath a putrid Feaver, if it be critical (that is proceeding from the Conqueſt of Nature over the Morbifick Matter and tending to expel the whol or Part thereof) it muſt not be ſtopped; neither muſt a Symptomatick Looſneſs be preſently ſtopped, at the very firſt, if it do not very much weaken the Patient, leaſt the Vitious Humor do flow back again to ſome prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Parts. When it is ſeaſonable to ſtop it, it muſt be done with a gentle aſtringent Purge, with clenſing and Corroborating Clyſters; by Medicines taken in and outwardly Applied, which do thicken, ſtrengthen and bind. All which may be taken out of our Cure of a Diarrhoea or Looſneſs: beginning with the gentler and proceeding if need be to the more ſtrong by Degrees.</p>
                        <p>Sweats if they be not Critical (that is cauſed by Nature expelling the Humor offenſive) but Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomatical [that is, cauſed by the vehemency of that Diſeaſe diſſolving the Body, and hunting the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors through the Skin] and doth very much weaken the Patient, they muſt be ſuppreſſed by cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Air, with ſprinkling cold Water and the leaves of the Willow and Vine-tree upon the pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and if need be by opening the Windows; the Body being cooled and ayred by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, the Cloths being light upon the Patient, and a Flock-bed being put inſtead of a Fether-bed: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by often ſprinkling the Patients Face with Water and Vinegar mingled together, and finally by the uſe of cooling Aſtringent Medicaments; ſuch as are cooling Epithemes applyed to the Heart, Liver, and whol Belly, and often changed. Oyntments made of Oyl of Roſes, of Mirtles, of Mucilages, and Aſtringent Pouders, are to be anointed upon the whol Body; but eſpecially upon the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone. Pouders of Roſes, Balauſtians, Pomegranate rinds, Myrtle, Maſtich, Terra Samia &amp;c Muſt be ſprinkled upon the Neck, Throat, under the Arm-pits, and in the Groins. Or let the Patient be wrapped in a Linnen Cloth, ſprinkled with a mixture of Vinegar and Water, and the aforeſaid pouders ſtrewed thereon; being in the mean time careful that no Inflamation, or Tumor be in the parts about the ſhort Ribs: for then we muſt abſtain from Aſtringent things, at leaſt ſuch as are ſtrong. The Sweat muſt not be wiped off, but ſuffered to dry about the Pores of the Skin, ſo to ſtop them that more may not follow.</p>
                        <p>Alſo we muſt give in at the Mouth, Medicaments that thicken and ſtrengthen, as Barley Water boiled with Lettice and cooling Seeds; Reſtorative Broths, with Juyce of Pomegranates, ſowr Grapes, Pouders of Corals, Pearls, ſhavings of Ivory, Sanders, or Baulauſtians. Juleps of the Waters of Roſes, Lettice, Purſlain, with Syrup of Pomegranates, dryed Roſes, or Quinces. Conſerved Electuaries, of Conſerve of Roſes, Corals, Pearls, Terra Sigillata, pouders of Diamargaritum fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidum, and ſuch like.</p>

                           <p>In the Cure of moſt acute and pernicious Feavers, one thing is diligently to be noted that ſuch Feavers ſeldom happen without ſome inward and peculiar diſorder and commonly Inflama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſome of the inward Bowels as Liver, Spleen &amp;c.

                           <hi>Chap. 3.</hi> Of a Tertian Ague.</head>
                        <p>AN Ague, or Intermittent Tertian Feaver, is cauſed by an Excrementitious Chollerick Humor, contained in the firſt Region of the Body, and there putrefying.</p>
                        <p>A Tertian Ague is either Legitimate and Exquiſite, or Illegitimate and baſtard.</p>
                        <p>A Legitimate or Exquiſite Tertian Ague, is terminated in twelve hours, and is cauſed by the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction of Natural Choller. But a baſtard Tertian hath fits that laſt above twelve hours. But if it exceed twenty four hours, it is termed <hi>Tertiana extenſa,</hi> a ſtretched Tertian. And it is cauſed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Preternatural Coller putrefying, or by Natural Choller mingled with other Humors, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially with flegm.</p>
                        <p>Alſo Tertian Agues are Simple, or Double, or Triple. A Simple Tertian, is that whoſe Fits come every other day. A Double Tertian is that whoſe Fits come every day. And although here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it differ not from a Quotidian or every day Ague, yet they are known one from the other by their proper Signs, ſhewing the abundance of Flegm or Choller in the Patient; of which Signs in their place. Somtimes notwithſtanding in a double Tertian there are two fits in one day, the other day remaining free; and this ſome latter Phyſitians do call two Tertians, and make it to differ from a double Tertian. Which Diſtinction notwithſtanding is of ſmal moment. A Triple Tertian is when there are three fits in the compaſs of two daies. This is a moſt rare and ſeldom ſeen ſort of Feavers. Yet <hi>Galen</hi> propounds one ſingle Example thereof, and I ſaw another in the yeer 1637. in a certain Gentleman, who once in ſixteen hours had a fit of a Tertian Ague. And all the fits did every one of them terminate in the ſpace of ten or twelve hours, by ſweat. Now theſe divers Parox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yſms are made by a different matter putreſying in different places, ſo that each one hath as it were its peculiar Chimney where it is firſt kindled.</p>
                        <p>Now the Humors cauſing Tertian Agues, are collected chiefly in the firſt Region of the Body, viz. In the Liver, the bladder of Gall, the Stomach, the Meſentery, the Pancreas, or in the Veins of thoſe Parts.</p>
                        <p>Their Cauſes, are all ſuch things which ingender Excrementitious Choller, viz. An hot and dry diſtemper of the Spleen, youthful Age, Hot Conſtitution of the Air, Watchings, Cares, Anger, Faſtings, uſe of hot Meats, over much Exerciſe. To theſe are added, for the breeding a baſtard Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, ſuch Cauſes as engender Flegm and Melancholly. Hereupon, ſuch as have hot Livers, and by Glutinous and bad Diet, do breed many Crudities, are ſubject to baſtard Tertians, by reaſon of the mixture of Choller with crude Humors. And hence alſo it is, that in Summer time, crude Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors bred through weakneſs of the Natural Heat, by eating of Fruits, and over much drinking, being mixed with Choller, do breed baſtard Tertians.</p>
                        <p>The Signs to know an Exquiſite Tertian by, are theſe: That this Feaver alwaies begins with great ſhaking Fits, whereas in a Quotidian Feaver or Ague, there is only a light ſhivering or cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. After the cold ſhaking Fit, follows great Heat, ſharp and biting, Intollerable Thirſt, great and frequent breathing, want of Sleep, Head-ach, and ſomtimes Ravings. After the ſhaking fit, ſomtimes there follows a vomiting of Chollerick Humors, or a purging by Stool. The Urine is ſomtimes Yellow, Yellowiſh-Red, or Red. The Fits laſt not above twelve hours, and they are terminated by Sweat. Alſo the Cauſes fore-cited, breeding Choller, have preceded.</p>
                        <p>In a baſtard Tertian, all the foregoing Signs are more remiſs than they are in an Exquiſite one, but more intenſe than in a Quotidian Ague. And according as there is more or leſs flegm mingled with the Choller, the Fits come neerer to thoſe of an Exquiſite Tertian, or of a Quotidian; but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the vehemency of the Symptoms, and the length of the Fit it ſelf. So that the Paroxyſms of a baſtard Tertian may be lengthened out to ſixteen, eighteen, or more hours. Although they may be ſomtimes ſhorter, becauſe of the paucity of the Matter, and be terminated within the ſpace of eight, ten, or twelve hours.</p>
                        <p>The Prognoſtick of this Diſeaſe, is taken out of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> in Sect. 4. Aph. 59. <hi>Exquiſite or exact Tertian Agues laſt but for ſeven fits at moſt.</hi> And in Aphor. 43. of the ſame Section, <hi>All Intermitting Feavers are void of danger.</hi> Which is to be underſtood only of ſuch Tertians as are void of all malignity. For there are Malignant and Peſtilent Tertians, which though they have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident Intermiſſions; yet do they often kill the Patients. Furthermore, many things fall upon the Neck of a Tertian, which may breed danger, although the Feaver of it ſelf be not dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Haly</hi> writes, and common Experience ſhews, That if ſuch as are ſick of a Tertian Ague, have Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, Scabs, or Puſtles breaking out in their Lips, it is a token the Ague wil leave them. For it is a kind of Critical Evacuation in thoſe parts.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="581" facs="tcp:49088:263"/>A Looſneſs befalling one that hath a Tertian Ague, the matter being digeſted, ends the Diſeaſe. And this is the way by which alone Nature doth perfectly expel the Cauſe of theſe Feavers. For ſeeing the Original Cauſe of theſe Feavers is contained in the Gall-Bladder, or the Liver, or the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentery, and other Parts in the firſt Region of the Body; although that which ſteems and vapors therefrom in every fit, do get into the habit of the Body, and is purged away, either by Sweats, or by inſenſible Tranſpiration, or by Puſhes and Pimples; yet the groſs parts and ſetlings of the Humor abiding in their place, which unleſs by the benefit of Nature, or Medicaments it be purged away by ſtool, it is wont to be the Cauſe either of a long Ague, or of Obſtructions, or of a Relapſe, or of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtubborn Diſeaſes.</p>
                        <p>Agues are wont to be of ſmal durance and little danger, if the habit of the whol Body be good, if the bowels be wel affected, if it be Spring or Summer, if the Patient eat little, and drink ſparingly. And contrary wiſe, they are wont to be long and more rebellious, if there be an evil diſpoſition of the Liver or Spleen if the Patient abound with flegmatick Humors or Melanchollick, if the Winter or Autumn be in their full force, if the Patients do eat much, or by much drinking do oppreſs their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Heat.</p>
                        <p>The Cure, as in other Feavers, is to be directed to the Feaver, its Cauſe, and ſtrength of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient. The Feaver calls for Coolers; the Cauſe requires Coolers likewiſe, and withal ſuch things as digeſt and purge the Humor offending; the Patients ſtrength calls for things that corroborate and vigorate the ſame.</p>
                        <p>And in the firſt place, A Cooling Diet muſt be appointed, and which moiſtens; it muſt be the very ſame in an exquiſite Tertian, which we before preſcribed in our Cure of Continual Feavers. But in a baſtard and ſingle Tertian, a fuller Diet ſomwhat, is to be enjoyned, eſpecially if the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe prove to be long; for then ſolid Meats are to be given on the wel-day, and five or ſix hours before the fit. But in a double Tertian, as in an exquiſite Tertian, the Sick muſt be nouriſhed only with broth, and other ſupping things.</p>
                        <p>This is a moſt pleaſant Drink out of <hi>Foreſtus,</hi> for thoſe which have a third day Ague.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Fountain Water two pints: Cinnamon half an ounce: Sugar three ounces: Let all be ſtrained cold and raw, through an Hippocras Bag.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Patient muſt not eat when the Fit is coming, according to that ſaying of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> in Aphor. 11. Sect. 1. For Nature (as <hi>Galen</hi> ſhews in his Commentary on that place) by Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of newly eaten Meat, is called away from Concoction of the Morbifick Humors. Add hereunto, That in the fit of an Ague, the whol body is filled with a filthy vapor, which doth mar, and for the moſt part corrupt that meat which is eaten neer the fit. But if the fit prove ſo long, or the Patients body ſo hot and dry, ſo lean and thinly woven together, with wide pores, that it is ſoon diſſolved and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipated, and cannot hold out to the end of the fit; the Patient in ſuch a caſe may be allowed to eat in the fit, and it wil be better to eat when the fit is in the ſtate or height, than at any other time. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, in the beginning alſo, and in the augmentation, neceſſity compelling, Meat may be given. For ſo <hi>Galen</hi> in the tenth of his Method, Chap. 5. was compelled to give Meat even in the beginning of the fits, unto ſuch as had this kind of Ague, being of a hot and dry temperature, unto whom faſting is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly hurtful, leſt they ſhould fall into ſwooning fits. And in imitation of him, <hi>Amatus Luſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> in the 68. Cure, of the fourth Century, to one that was full of, and vomited pure Choller, and by that means fell into ſwooning fits, he gave bread dipt in water, and ſprinkled with Juyce of ſown Grapes in the beginning of the Ague fit; by which means he hindered the aforeſaid Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes.</p>
                        <p>There is one thing yet further to be obſerved both in this, and all other Agues, That the Patient do neither eat, drink, nor ſleep, before the fit. But it wil be good that the Patient go to ſtool, by means of a Clyſter, provided the ſame be adminiſtred before the beginning of the fit.</p>
                        <p>Having therefore ordered a convenient Diet, we muſt forth with proceed to evacuate the Morbifick Matter, which ſeeing it ſticks in the firſt Paſſages, it muſt be voided not only by Clyſter, but by Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Vomitories.</p>
                        <p>Clyſters in an exquiſite Tertian, muſt be made of an Emollient and Cooling Decoction, with Caſſia, Catholicum, Diaprunum ſimple, and purgative. But in a baſtard Tertian, let the Decoction be of Emollient and Cutting ſimples, diſſolving therein Diaphoenicon, Honey of Roſes, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Purgative Medicaments in an exquiſite Tertian, muſt be the ſame which have been propounded in continual Feavers. But in a baſtard Tertian, there muſt be added Agarick, Senna, Catholicum, Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoenicon, and others, ſuch as the Judicious Phyſitian ſhall conceive moſt ſuitable to the conſtitution of the ſick. And in every ſort of Agues, Cream of Tartar may profitably be added to the Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, becauſe it opens Obſtructions, is potently clenſing, and yet cools withal. Purging Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines are to be given on the day of Intermiſſion, and that in the morning, as commonly is uſed; if the time of Intermiſſion fall within thoſe hours: if not, the middle ſpace between the two fits muſt be choſen. And at any hour of the day or night, we may give a Purge, provided it be far from the Fit, and the Stomach have digeſted what was laſt eaten.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="582" facs="tcp:49088:264"/>But in a double Tertian, 'tis an hard matter to chooſe a convenient time to give a Purge, becauſe many times, not above three or four hours do fal between two fits. Yea, And ſomtimes the fits are ſo long, that the one begins before the other be ended, which makes them be called <hi>Febres Subintran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> encroaching or intruding Feavers. For then the ſpeedineſs of the occaſion or opportune time, requires the uttermoſt diligence of the Phyſitian. Now the more commodious hour of giving the Medicine, is thus to be choſen. In a double Tertian not encroaching, the Medicament muſt be given in the end of the Fit, at ſuch a diſtance from the following Fit, that the working of the Phyſick may be over ere the other Fit come. But in an encroaching Ague, when the latter Fit interfers with the former, the Medicament muſt be given in the beginning of the declination, as ſoon as it begins never ſo little to remit. And in both Caſes the Patient muſt drink Broth, three hours after the Medicament is taken; yet ſo, as that there muſt be remaining three hours from the Broth-taking before the next Fit begin. So that the Medicament, is to be given at leaſt ſix hours before the next Fit.</p>
                        <p>As for Vomits, What was ſaid of them in the Cure of Continual Feavers, may be here very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modionſly applyed; becauſe the abundance of evil Humors conteined in the Stomach, Meſenterie, and Cavity of the Liver, which is wont to cauſe theſe Feavers, is brought away by Vomit; which ſomtimes cannot be moved by purging Medicines given again and again, as <hi>Fernelius</hi> hath well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. And therefore, If in the beginning of the Fit, the Patient be vexed with Vomitings, the Phyſitian ſhall do well to follow that motion of Nature. And ſeeing the gentleſt ſorts of Vomits, will not ordinarily ſerve the turn, we muſt proceed to the middle ſort, ſuch as is eſpecially <hi>Aſarum,</hi> of the pouder whereof, half adram, two ſcruples or one dram, is given in Broth, or ſome other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Liquor. Others give the Decoction thereof, which is made of three drams of Aſarum Roots, boiled in Chicken Broth, or in Barley Broth made with Raiſons. The Chymiſts do give white Vitriol prepared, and Salt of Vitriol, and alſo <hi>Aqua Benedicta,</hi> which is made of <hi>Crocus Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum.</hi> Which, as other Medicaments made of Antimony, as they do ſomtimes happily rid away ſuch morbifick Matter as is lodged in the firſt paſſages about the Stomach and Meſenterie, &amp;c. So do they require a prudent and skilful Phyſitian to adminiſter them; otherwiſe they are like a ſharp Knife in the hand of an Infant, or like a Sword in the hand of a Mad-man.</p>
                        <p>The firſt paſſages of the Body, or firſt Region thereof, being purged, at leaſt with one Purge, a Vein is to be opened in the Wel-Day. Yea verily, And if the Patient be Plethorick, the Urins red and thick, the Cure is well begun by Blood-letting, for the Purge will afterwards work the better.</p>
                        <p>If the Blood appear very Hot, Aduſt, or Putrid, Bloodletting muſt be repeated; which yet is left to the Judgment of the Phyſitian, according as he finds the Patients conſtitution.</p>
                        <p>After Purgation and Phlebotomie, we muſt endevor to prepare the Humors, by Juleps ſuch as were ſet down in the Cure of Continual Feavers; the matter whereof muſt be varied, according as Flegm or Melancholly is mingled with Choller, as was obſerved in the place aforeſaid.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time, whilſt the Medicines aforeſaid are making, the Feaveriſh heat is to be allaied with cooling Epithems applyed to the heart &amp; Liver, ſuch as were propounded in Continual Feavers, with this Caution, that they be never laid on, but in the height of the Hot-Fit, or rather when it firſt begins to abate.</p>
                        <p>To the Liver alſo and the Loins, Oyntment of Roſes, or the cooling Oyntment of <hi>Galen</hi> may be applyed.</p>
                        <p>Alſo Emollient and cooling Clyſters, will be very good at the end of the Fit, as well as in the beginning.</p>
                        <p>The matter being prepared certain daies, by the uſe of Juleps, Purgation muſt be again uſed, with Senna, Rhubarb, Catholicum, Syrup of Roſes; adding thereto Agarick, if Flegm abound. And And if the Patient be ſtrong; we may add <hi>Diaprunum Solutivum, Electuarium de Succo Roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> or <hi>Diaphaenicon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Body being again purged, after the uſe of Juleps, if the Fits return and ſeem longer than they were before, it is a ſign that groſs Humors, and ſuch as ſtick faſt in the Body, do nouriſh the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and breed Obſtructions: In regard of which, clenſing, opening and cutting things are to be uſed The Principal of which is Wormwood, which is exceedingly commended by <hi>Galen.</hi> In his 1. Book <hi>ad Glauconem</hi> Chap. 9. and Century, which in regard of the rare vertues it has in curing Agues, is called <hi>Febrifuga,</hi> that is to ſay Ague-Queller. But becauſe theſe Herbs are hot, they may be qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified by the Commixture of cooling things, after this manner.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Roots of Graſs, Cichory, Aſparagus, of each one ounce: Leaves of Agrimony, Sorrel, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cbory, Endive, of each one handful: vulgar Wormwood and Centaury, of each an handful: Boil all to a pint. In the ſtrained Liquor diſſolve three ounces of Syrup of Lemmons. Make all into a Julep for to be taken at three times in the morning.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Juleps being finiſhed, a Purgation muſt be again adminiſtred or a Vomitory, if Nature affect to diſcharge her ſelf that way. For then, the ſigns of Concoction appearing, theſe Feavers are
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:49088:264"/>
ſomtimes happily Cured by Vomiting. And <hi>Galen</hi> in his firſt Book ad <hi>Glauconem</hi> Chap. 10. Writes that many are Cured of this kind of Ague only by a Vomit yea verily and daily experience ſhews, that <hi>Aqua Benedicta</hi> doth eradicate theſe Feavers or Agues for the moſt Part, unleſs ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacious obſtructions of the Bowels do hinder. Many Experiments hereof are propounded by <hi>Martinus Rulandus</hi> in the Centuries of his Cures. But, it is, as was ſaid before, a vehement Medicament, and not to be given without extream Caution. Some give an ounce of <hi>Aqua Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedicta</hi> with the Infuſion of half an ounce of Senna, and ſo it works more by Stool than by Vomit.</p>
                        <p>Others uſe Cambogia, others <hi>Mercurius Dulcis</hi> with Scammony. Which Medicaments, ſeeing they do potently Evacuate, do often Pluck theſe kind of Feavers away by the Roots, but they are to be given only to ſuch as are ſtrong of Conſtitution.</p>
                        <p>To theſe Medicaments exquiſite Tertians and Baſtard ones too, are wont to give place. But if the Agues do yet ſtubbornly reſiſt (as it ofttimes fals out) Solemn Purgation muſt be made with an Apozem to be taken three daies, made of the Materials of the foreſaid Juleps, adding thereto Senna, Rhubarb, Agarick, Syrup of Roſes of Cichory with Rhubarb and ſuch like. Yea verily and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Ague be gone before the uſe of this Apozem, if a Voluntary Looſneſs do not befal the Patient. For the ſolution of an Ague by Sweat or inſenſible Tranſpiration, as not to be truſted unto, gives ſuſpition of a Relapſe; becauſe by them the thinner Part only of the Humor is Evacuated, the thicker being left behind: which can no other waies be Evacuated, ſave by Stool.</p>
                        <p>Before the Apozem aforeſaid be uſed, if there be a Diſtenſion in the Parts under the ſhort Ribs, let this following Emollient, attenuating and ſtrengthening fomentation be applied.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Roots of Marſh-Mallows, Graſs and Aſparagus, of each one ounce: Roots of Enula Campana and the middle Bark of Tamarisk of each half an ounce: Leaves of Mallows, Violets, Agrimony, Maiden-Hair and Wormwood, of each an handfull: Lin-Seed and Faenu-Greek Seed, of each one ounce: Flowers of Chamomel, Melilot, Roſes of each a pugil: Boyl all in three Parts of Water and one of white Wine, put in towards the concluſion, with two ounces of Vinegar: with this Decoction foment the Parts under the ſhort Ribs Morning and Evening, for two daies before the uſe of the Apozem.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>After Fomentation, anoint the ſaid Parts with this following Oyntment.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Oyl of Lillies, Sweet Almonds and Tamarisk of each one ounce: Oyntment of Marſh-Mallows two ounces: and a little Wax. Make all into a Liniment.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If after al theſe remedies, the ſtubborn Ague do yet lengthen the time and keep its ground; and the Patients Face appear ſwoln, and paliſh, alſo their Lege ſwel towards night: they are to be plied with ſuch Medicines as are commonly preſcribed for obſtructions of the Liver. Among the reſt, <hi>Montanus</hi> doth very much commend the Decoction of Cichory and Germander in Broath; which he ſaies is admirable in long Feavers that are cauſed by obſtructions.</p>
                        <p>Yet, it is to be noted; that the length of a Tertian Ague is ſome times cauſed by an hot and dry diſtemper of the Liver, whith perpetually produces a Chollerick Humor, the Cauſe of new Fits. Which is often obſerved in many, which being of a dry and meagre conſtitution of body and wholly Chollerick, have had a Tertian Ague three or four months together, eſpecially in the more hot ſeaſon of the yeer, without any tenſion of their Bowels, or any aboundance of Humours. To ſuch as theſe, ſtrong purgers, and ſtrong aperitives or heaters do hurt. But ſuch as theſe are to be plied with a cooling and moiſtening diet, with Juleps and Broaths of the ſame Nature. And the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous Humors are to be Purged away by little and little with Emollient and Refrigerating Clyſters, with Caſſia, Tamarinds, Catholicon and Syrup of Roſes. But in this caſe eſpecially great miracles are performed by a bath of Blood-warm Water, which doth extinguiſh the hot and dry diſtemper which is imprinted upon the Bowels. Let the Patient uſe theſe baths, on the Well-day, but without ſweating.</p>
                        <p>Somtimes alſo the Length of Tertian Agues ariſes from the evil diſpoſition of ſome of the Bowels, eſpecially of the Liver and Melentery; which cannot be Cured by purgations though never ſo oft repeated, becauſe that evil Quality remaining ſtil in the Liver, cauſes new Morbifick Matter daily to breed, which produces new Fits. Which evil Diſpoſition or Quality of the Bowels, is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by Diureticks, Sudoroſicks and other reſolving Medicaments.</p>
                        <p>With which faculties theſe following ſimples are endued viz. Wormwood, Centory, Carduu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>A dram of Uenice Treacle is ordinarily given with white Wine, before the Fit, three times one after another.</p>
                        <p>Some give a walnut preſerved in Sugar or Honey after the ſame manner.</p>
                        <p>When the Heat of Uenice Treacle is feared, it is at firſt given by it ſelf, and a draught of Plantain-Water

                        <p>A Cup of <hi>Hippocras</hi> given before the Fit wil work the ſame effect, with which pleaſant Medicine many have been Cured.</p>
                        <p>Yet muſt it carefully be obſerved, that theſe remedies muſt not be given, till the Patient hath been diligently Purged.</p>

                        <p>Beſides the Medicaments hitherto propounded, which reſpect a regular and Methodical Cure; there are many other ſpecifick and Empirick Medicaments, both internal and external; both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by Practitioners, and frequently uſed by the common People; out of the almoſt infinite number whereof I ſhal here ſet down ſuch as are the choiceſt. And among theſe Medicines may be reckoned, ſuch things as were before propounded, to amend the evil Quality of the Liver and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentery which is wont to make long Agues: whereunto, theſe things following may profitably be added.</p>
                        <p>And in the firſt place, Spirit of Sulphur in a Legitimate Tertian, or one very neer Legitimate, after bleeding and Purging, being given with Purſlain Water in the vigor of the Fit, doth power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully extinguiſh the heat of the Feaver; and if the Humor be thin, drives the ſame out by ſweat, that there remaines no matter for a new Fit, and ſo is the Diſeaſe Somtimes pluckt up by the Roots. It is given from half a ſcruple to a ſcruple, with four ounces of Purſlain Water.</p>
                        <p>And ſomtime the ſaid ſpirit is mingled with Salt of Wormwood, which is alſo of great Efficacy in the Cure of Agues the Compoſition is thus.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Salt of Wormwood half a dram: Spirit of Sulphur a ſcruple: Carduus Water four ounces: Mix them. Let the Patient take it when the Fit Approaches and he covered with many Cloathes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Some Affirm that the Juyce of Plantain Clarified and drunk to the Quantity of four ounces, an hour before the Fit, doth Cure a Tertian Ague. Some give it with Vineger and Saffron after this manner</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>of the Juyce of Plantain four ounces: Vinegar of Roſes half an ounce: Saffron three grains: Mix them and give the Patient to drink, two hours before the Fit.</hi>

                        <p>A Medicine commonly uſed, and often ſucceſsful, is, a little Potion made of Roſe-Water, Plantain Water and Aqua Vita of each a ſpoonful; given before the Fit.</p>
                        <p>Theſe following are outwardly applied.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Leaves of Hyſſop and Tanſie cut ſmal, of each a pugil; Mirrh two drams: Mace, Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megs, Cloves and Cinnamon, of each half a dram: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enice Turpentine and Juyce of Tanſey, of each one ounce: Mix all and ſpread them upon a Roſe-Cake, fried in a frying Pan with Canary Wine, which being covered with a Linnen Cloath muſt be applied hot to the Region of the ſtomach, an hour before the Fit.</hi> Or,</p>

                        <p>Alſo this following Cataplaſm may profitably be applied to the Liver.</p>

Vinegar make a Cataplaſm, to be applied to the Region of the Liver one hour before the Fit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Neither are thoſe Medicines wholly to be rejected which the common people are wont to apply un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Wriſts of ſuch as have Agues. For not only the Opinion of People is hereby ſatisfied, who conceive that many are cured with theſe Remedies; but ſomwhat they may effect, by communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their vertues unto the Heart by thoſe notable Arteries which are ſcituate in the Wriſts. The chief of which kind of Medicines are theſe that follow.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Leaves of Plantane, Celondine the great, of each one handful: Cobwebs, Nettle Seeds, Soot from the Chimney, and common Salt, of each one dram: the ſtrongeſt Vinegar as much as ſhall ſuffice. Make of all a Cataplaſm to be applied to the Wriſts a little before the fit, and to be repeated freſh three or four times.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mouſ-Ear beaten with Salt and Vinegar, is by ſome accounted of great efficacy, being applied to the Wriſts before the fit.</p>
                        <p>Of ſome, the ſmalleſt ſort of Houſleek or Mouſ-teat is commended, being uſed after the ſame manner.</p>
                        <p>Others commend the Leaves of Shepheards-purſe beaten with Salt and Vinegar.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Platerus</hi> applies unto the Wriſts the inner bark of the Nut-tree ſleeped in Vinegar; which he ſaith, had been by him uſed with ſucceſs.</p>
                        <p>Finally, Others apply ſuch things as are apt to bliſter the Skin, as Garlick, Onions, Crow-foot, and the like; which are leſs ſafe than the former, and very troubleſom to the Patient.</p>

                           <hi>Chap. 4.</hi> Of a Quotidian Feaver.</head>
                        <p>A Quotidian Ague is ſo called, becauſe its fits do return every day. Wherein it agrees with a double Tertian, and a triple Quartan, but is diſtinguiſhed from them by ſigns proper to it ſelf. This Feaver is moſt rarely ſeen, ſo that among ſix hundred Patients that have Agues which come eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, ſcarce one of them is troubled with a Quotidian or every day Ague.</p>
                        <p>This Ague is cauſed by flegm putrefying in the firſt Region of the Body: And therefore all ſuch things as multiply flegm in the Body, may cauſe this Ague, ſuch as are, a cold and moiſt diſtemper of the Bowels, old Age, Childs Age, an idle life, Autumn Seaſon, Meats cold and moiſt, long Sleeps and ſuch like.</p>
                        <p>The Diagnoſtick Signs are ſuch as teſtifie flegm to abound in the Body; as greatneſs of bulk, ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and fatneſs, white color, or pale, dull ſence, profound ſleep, and dreams of Waters. Alſo this Feaver for the moſt part comes in the night, and that without ſhaking, only with a coldneſs or light ſhivering, becauſe the Morbifick Matter being benign, and not much an Enemy to Nature, doth leſs provoke her; and therefore the heat is not ſuddenly drawn inward as in a Tertian Ague, but retires by little and little. The time of Coldneſs being over, Heat is ſlowly and unequally kindled, ſo that the Patient feels ſomtimes heat, and then cold, and then heat again. Alſo the heat is mild, and not at all ſcorching, and thirſt little. The Urines are at firſt white, thin, and undigeſted; and in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs they appear more thick, and better colored. The Pulſe is ſmal, ſeldom, and ſlow. The Parts about the ſhort Ribs do ſwel, and are commonly puffed up, and diſtended. The fits do commonly laſt twelve hours, and do not end but ſo as to leave ſome Feaveriſh heat behind them; becauſe this Feaver is like a fire of green wood, which is both long in kindling, and leaves much ſmoak behind it. Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the ſit is extended to twenty four hours, and it ſeems to be a continual Feaver.</p>
                        <p>Now theſe Signs are very variable, and appear more intenſe or remiſs, according as the flegm is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſimple, or mingled with other Humors; and likewiſe according to the different kind of the flegm which putrefies. So that, according to <hi>Galen</hi> in his Book of Plenitude, Chap. 11. Salt flegm makes the Patients thirſty; acid or ſowr flegm makes them hungry; ſweet flegm makes them ſleepy; taſtleſs flegm makes them without appetite to Meat: and likewiſe Feavers which are cauſed by acid or Glaſſie flegm, are wont to come with a ſhaking fit.</p>
                        <p>This Feaver is wont to be perpetually long, becauſe of the thickneſs and contumacy of the Morbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick Matter, and laſts forty daies, and ſomtimes three or four months. Neither is it without danger, ſeeing it may degenerate into a Cachexy, Dropſie, Lethargy, and other grievous Diſeaſes. The lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or ſhorter durance of this Feaver, is known by the ſigns of Crudity and Concoction, and alſo by the Evacuations, which for the moſt part Nature endeavors by Vomit, Stool, or Sweat: For thoſe Evacuations appearing, ſhew the Diſeaſe ſhorter: but if Nature endeavor no Evacuation, the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe wil prove the longer.</p>
                        <p>A Quotidian Ague that comes in the day time, is leſs dangerous than that which comes a nights, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> doth teach us in 3. <hi>Epidem. Sect. 5. T.</hi> 64. He calls the former a Diurnal, the latter a Nocturnal. The reaſon of which Prognoſtick, is becauſe that the Diurnal have longer fits; for teaching unto night, in which the pores of the Skin are cloſed, the putrid vapors are kept within, not
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:49088:266"/>
having freedom to breath forth by which means, the fits are lengthened, and as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> himſelf ſaith, do very often bring the Patient into a Conſumption. Ad hereunto, That ſeeing the Intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion happens in the night, we are forced to give the Patient Meat in the night, which is un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>eaſonable, and hinders the Patient from ſleeping; by which means great weakneſs is cauſed, and the Patient is much hurt, and the Functions of the Body quite put out of frame.</p>
                        <p>The Cure muſt be in a manner the ſame with that which was propounded for a baſtard and lingring Tertian, yet ſo as that among ſuch things as prepare the Humors, and open Obſtructions, we make choyce of ſuch, which have a greater power to attenuate and cut the Humors. Alſo in this Feaver a ſpecial care is to be had of the Stomach, which for the moſt part is grievouſly afflicted; and therefore muſt be recreated with ſtrengthening Medicaments, both given in, and out wardly applied, The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplaſm of Mint and Worm wood, propounded in the Cure of a Tertian Ague, is very good in this caſe.</p>

                           <hi>Zacutus Luſitanus</hi> propounds two Medicines, with which he glories that he had vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed moſt ſtubborn Quotidian Agues. The one is a Decoction of Chamomel, made after this manner:</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Flowers of Chamomel three pugils: Tops of Roman Wormwood two pugils. Boyl all in three pints of Water to a pint and an half. Add to the ſtrainings four ounces of Sugar. Let the Patient drink five or ſix ounces every morning.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The other is a Decoction of China and Guajacum drunk twenty five daies together; which though Phyſitians are afraid to uſe in ſuch Feavers as theſe, becauſe of the over-great heating and drying Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; yet is it mightily commended by ſuch as have writ whol Books of the Spices and Drugs of <hi>India.</hi> Yet we muſt remember that <hi>Zacutus Luſitanus</hi> practiced Phyſick in a Country cold and moiſt, where theſe Medicines may more ſafely be uſed. And therefore in other Countries that are hotter, they muſt not be given ſave unto very Flegmatick and Cachectical bodies.</p>

                           <hi>Chap. 5.</hi> Of a Quartan Ague.</head>
                        <p>AQuartan Ague is that which hath its Fits returning every fourth day, and it is cauſed by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly putrefying in the firſt Region of the Body.</p>
                        <p>Now Melancholly is of two ſorts; Natural, and Preternatural. The Natural is bred of the thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker and more earthy part of our Nouriſhment, being cold and dry. The Preternatural, is cauſed by aduſtion of Choller, and is therefore hot and dry. Hence ariſe two ſorts of Quartan Agues; for that which is bred of Natural Melancholly, is called a legitimate Quartan; that which is bred of Preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Melancholly, is called a baſtar Quartan. Howbeit, the baſtard Quartan may alſo come of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Melancholly, being mingled with ſome portion of Choller.</p>
                        <p>Again, A Quartan Ague is either Single, Double, or Triple. A Single Quartan is when one Fit alone comes every fourth day. A Double is when two Fits happen upon two daies one immediately after the other, and the third day is free. A Triple Quartan is when the Fits come every day, as they do in a Quotidian, and in a Double Tertian. Now theſe Double and Triple Quartans come of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly putrefying in divers parts of the Body.</p>
                        <p>The Signs to know this Ague by, are firſt, ſuch things as argue that Melancholly abounds in the Patient. Unto which muſt be added the coming of the Fit upon the fourth day, which is the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar ſign. Alſo the form of the fit differing from the fits of other Agues, doth diſcover this Diſeaſe. For it begins with yawning and ſtretchings, together with heavineſs of the whol Body; after which follows cold, and then ſhivering and ſhaking, in which the Patients ſeem to have their bones broken. Alſo the heat is kindled by little and little in a cold and thick Matter. The Pulſe is ſeldomer and ſlower than in other Feavers. The Urines are at firſt white, thin, and watry; but in the progreſs they are more colored, and thicker. Now theſe ſigns appear in a legitimate Quartan. But in a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard Quartan, the vehemence of the Symptomes being greater, doth argue the Humor to be thinner and hotter. But a baſtard Quartan is not diſtinguiſhed from a legitimate, herein alone, in that in a baſtard Quartan, the heat, thirſt, watchings, and other Symptoms, are more vehement; but in that the legitimate begins of it ſelf, without any Feaver foregoing; but a baſtard Quartan ſucceeds other Feavers and Agues, by reaſon of the aduſtion of the Humor which cauſed thoſe Diſeaſes, by means of which aduſtion, it degenerates into Preternatural Melancholly.</p>
                        <p>A Double Quartan is eaſily known by the Courſe of the fits. And a Triple Quartan is diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed from a Double Tertian, and a Quotidian, not only by the Signs of Melancholly abounding, and by the form of the Fits; but alſo becauſe it was firſt a Single, or a Double Quartan before it came to be a Triple Quartan. For very rarely, or never doth a Quartan Ague begin with a Triple; but a Simple or Double Quartan degenerates into a Triple.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="587" facs="tcp:49088:266"/>As for what concerns the Prognoſtick; this kind of Ague is wont to be longeſt of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and that which begins in the fal of the leaf continues al Winter commonly, and goeth not away til the Spring come. Yea and ſome Quartans continue a yeer or yeers. Summer Quartans are the ſhorteſt. In al of them we muſt have a continual eye to the ſigns of concoction which ſignifie the ſolution of the diſeaſe to be at hand; and with theſe, for the patient to make black urine is a good token.</p>
                        <p>A legitimate Quartan is longer than a baſtard Quartan becauſe the former proceeds from a thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, the latter from a thinner Humor</p>
                        <p>This kind of Ague is wont to be very ſafe from danger, eſpecially the legitimate, being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with no grievous affection of any of the bowels. But the baſtard Quartan is more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. and if the Liver, Spleen, or any other part be grievouſly damnified, it degenerates into a Dropſie,</p>
                        <p>Aged perſons above ſixty years, being taken with a Quartan Ague, do for the moſt part dy of it: becauſe their naturall heat is too weak to overcome ſo contumacious an Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor.</p>
                        <p>An intermitting Quartan, being changed into a continual, is for the moſt part deadly. Becauſe that Feaver whoſe motion was outward, is changed into one whoſe motion is inward. Which moſtly falls out in the Winter, the cold meeting with the humours which were but outward and beating them back into the innermoſt Cloſets of the Body. The which alſo come to paſs by unſeaſonable uſe of ſharp and vehement purges. For thereby of ſimple Quartans, double, triple, and continual are generated.</p>
                        <p>A Quartan Ague coming upon one that hath the falling ſickneſs cures the ſame, according to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in the 70 Aphoriſm of the 5 Section. <hi>Thoſe that have Quartan Agues are not much troubled with Convulſions. And if having firſt Convulſions, a Quartan Ague follows, they are freed from their Convulſions,</hi> Now the reaſon which <hi>Galen</hi> in his Comment gives here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is; becauſe the thick matter which cauſed the Convulſions is by the long heat of this Ague, attenuated and digeſted. Alſo by the ſhaking of the Body in the cold Fits, the ſaid Humor is more eaſily ejected. We muſt alſo add, that the evil Humors lurking in the Brain and other parts, as alſo in the veins, is transferred to the Hypochondria and more ignoble parts, where the Melancholly Quartanary Humors are ſeated, and ſo leaves the parts aforeſaid.</p>
                        <p>A bloody flux coming upon a quartan Ague, tends to health, according to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in the 48 Aphoriſm of the ſixt ſection. <hi>To ſuch as are ſplenetick a Dyſenterie is good.</hi> Now in a quartan Ague, commonly the Spleen is miſaffected, and a melancholly humor is common to a quartan Ague and a miſaffected Spleen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but this muſt be underſtood of a ſhort dyſenterie, for a long one is wont to be mortal; as we have it in the 43. Aphoriſm of the ſaid ſection. <hi>Such as being troubled with the Spleen have a flux of the Belly with pain, if it turn into a long Dyſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie or Bloody flux, they fall either into a Dropſie or a Lienterie, and dy.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To bleed at the noſe in a quartan Ague, is a very bad ſign. Becauſe the Humor which cauſes a quartan is too thick and too cold to be voided that way; and becauſe ſuch bleeding is ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomatical, and if it continue wil breed a dropſie; it muſt preſently be ſtopped by opening the baſilica vein, out of which the putrid blood may flow, becauſe the pure blood comes from the Noſe.</p>
                        <p>The quartan Ague hath a double cure according to the two kinds thereof. For the remedies uſed in a baſtard quartan, muſt be far different from thoſe which are uſed in a legitimate one.</p>
                        <p>And that we may begin with a Legitimate quartan: we muſt preſently ſet our ſelves to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh the cauſe thereof, not regarding the Feaver. And ſeeing the cauſe thereof is an humor cold and dry, thick and earthly; we muſt uſe medicaments that do heat, moiſten, and atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate. Alſo the Peccant Humor muſt be at ſeaſonable times evacuated, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding will require a long time to do; becauſe of the extream contumacy of the Humor and length of the diſeaſe. But before theſe medicines be uſed, we muſt appoint the patient a convenient diet. Let the patient therefore uſe meats of good juyce, eaſy to digeſt, of thin ſubſtance, and moderately heating and moiſtening; as the fleſh of young Animals and mountain Birds, new Egs ſoft boiled, Fiſhes that are taken in ſtony Rivers. In the ſtate of the diſeaſe we may allow the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Salt Fiſh, Capars, and Olives<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                           <hi>Galen 1. ad Glauco.</hi> Grants likewiſe Pepper and Muſtard. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Herbs Borrage is commended and Bugloſs, Pimpernel and Spinach, Fennell and Parſly Roots, but eſpecailly Turneps, which muſt be firſt boiled in water, and afterwads in fat broath which is very good for ſuch as have the quartan. <hi>Crato</hi> in his Councels collected by <hi>Scholtzius,</hi> brags that he had cured many of the quartan Ague by the ſecond broath of turneps ſeaſoned with Butter and Sugar. Of fruits, Apples, and ſtewed Prunes, Raiſons of the Sun, fat Figs, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds,
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:49088:267"/>
Dates, Pine-kernels are good. And finally, to Spice their Meats, let them uſe Cinnamon, Nutmeg, and Saffron.</p>
                        <p>Let the Patient abſtain from Meats which are thick of ſubſtance and clammy and are long in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing through; ſuch as the Fleſh of Swine, Beef, Deer, Hares and Water fowl, from Peaſe and Beans, Colewort, Courſe Branny Bread, Cheeſe, Nuts, Walnuts and Chaſtnuts; from Fleſh much Salted, or dried in the Smoak; from fruits, Raw Herbs, from Vinegar, Verjuice, becauſe they are thought as al other ſowr things to ferment Mellancholy and make it work</p>
                        <p>Let their drink be ſmal Ale or bear of moderate ſtrength and meanly hopped neither new nor hard, Pure and wel Clarifiedwhite Wine or Cla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Let them eat ſparingly, no more than may barely preſerve ſtrength; for too larg feeding breeds crudities which makes the Diſeaſe of long continuance. But above al, they muſt be very ſpare in drinking, becauſe nothing makes this Diſeaſe more rebellious and hard to Cure than over much drink and moiſt things, for they fil and Swel the ſpleen. <hi>Crato</hi> forbids al uſe of drink in the fit, which to forbear doth much as he ſaies help the Cure. On the fit-day, the Patient muſt eat ſix hours before the ſit comes. And afterward nothing muſt be taken til the fit be over. Long ſleep is good, becauſe it moiſtens, but it muſt be forborn in the beginning of the Fit. On the daies of Intermiſſion light exerciſe before Meat, is good; or in place thereof, frictions of the whol Body, after the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent hath been at Stool. If thee Patient be coſtive, a Clyſter or Suppoſitory muſt be given. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly let the Patient be as cheerful as may be and avoid ſadneſs</p>
                        <p>The Patients Diet being thus ordered; firſt a gentle Purgation muſt be adminiſtred, by a Clyſter and a purging Medicament. the Clyſter may be thus Made.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Roots of Bugloſs two ounces: of the four Emollient Herbs, mercury and beetes of each one handful: Fat Damask Prunes five Pair: of the four larger cool Seeds and Annis Seed of each two drams: Epithymum three drams: Boyl all to a pint and an half: in the ſtrained Liquor diſſolve Catholicum one ounce: Oyl of Violets and Chamomel of each one ounce and an half: Red Sugar one ounce: Make of all a Clyſter, which muſt be given the day before the following Potion, at a ſeaſonable time.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Senna half an ounce: Annis Seed a dram: Leaves of Borrage and Fumitory of each one handful. Liquoris three drams: Boyl all to three ounces: in the ſtrained Liquor diſſolve Manna and Syrup of Roſes of each one ounce: Make all into a potion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Galen</hi> in I. <hi>ad Glauco. Ch:</hi> 11. Bids us give only gentle and benign Medicaments in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Ague, otherwiſe, it is to be ſeared, that if we uſe ſtronger Medicaments, of a ſimple Quartan, we ſhal make a double, a triple or a Continual Feaver.</p>
                        <p>After the firſt Purge aforſaid, Blood muſt be drawn from the <hi>Baſilica Vena</hi> of the left Arm. Yet, if the Liver be affected, it may be drawn from the right Arm. And their Opinion is Ridiculous, who ſay that we muſt expect Concoction before we let Blood, becauſe then the Blood will be more thin and apt to flow: for it is better digeſted and prepared, if firſt ſome Quantity thereof be taken away. Neither muſt we give eare to them which ſay, that Blood-letting is not to be allowed of in a Quarran Ague, unleſs redundancy of Blood do ſhew it ſelf by the Swelling of the Veins and by other ſigns. For there is evermore at the beginning a Plethora ad Vires viz. Such a fullneſs of Blood as the Strength of the Patient cannot mannage, unleſs a Quartan do follow ſome other long Feaver. But that Precept of <hi>Galen</hi> formerly mentioned in I. <hi>ad Glauconem,</hi> is worthy of al Commendation, which ſaies that if the Blood which firſt comes away be Black and impure, that then the greater Quantity is to be taken away: but if it be Red and Pure, little muſt be taken, and the Patient muſt not be let Blood any more. The wel daies are fitteſt both for Bleeding and purging. Yet ſome let Blood upon the fit day, five or ſix hours before the Fit. which is not Ammis, becauſe the Humors beginning then to be moued, are more eaſily drawn out. <hi>Zacutus Luſitanus</hi> ſaies, that it is very good to let Blood when the <hi>Moon</hi> is in the ful. For then, by reaſon of the <hi>Moons</hi> influence, that earthy Melancholick Humor doth Boyl and become more fluid and Apt to come away with bleeding. And he doth Teſtifie that many have by bleeding at that time been helped, and ſome perfectly cured, who could not by any other means receive Help. But Botallus contrary to the mind of <hi>Galen</hi> and al other Phyſitians, doth aver that frequent Blood-letting doth cure the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Ague, yea when it threatens a Dropſie; and he endeavours to confirm his Opinion by reaſons and examples. Which notwithſtanding is to be rejected as a Paradox, ſeeing the Refrigeration of the whol Body cauſed by much Beeding, makes the Morbiſick matter more thick and contumaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
                        <p>The flux of the Hemorrhoids, is very good in Quartan Agues, and many are thereby Cured. For ſeeing the Hemorrhoid Veins are branches of the Meſaraick Veins, in which the matter of this Diſeaſe is conteined, when they are opened they Evacuate the immediate cauſe of this Diſeaſe. If
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:49088:267"/>
therefore a flux of the Hemorrhoids happens in ſuch as have been accuſtomed thereunto, it muſt not be ſtopped. If it be too ſparing, it muſt be furthered. As alſo if Nature ſeem to incline that way (which is known by itching of the Fundament, and by ſome drops of blood coming that way) the Blood muſt be made to come by application of Leeches.</p>
                        <p>But in ſuch as have not been uſed to have their Hemorrhoid Veins opened, after bleeding in the Arm, it is good to let them blood in the Ankle Vein; by which oftentimes the Ague ceaſes; or at leaſt that Bleeding, with other Remedies, will haſten the Cure; eſpecially in Women whoſe Courſes are ſtopt, or flow not ſufficiently.</p>
                        <p>The opening of the Vein between the little Finger and the Ring Finger, called <hi>Vena Salvatella,</hi> is approved by the Antients, and many later Phyſitians, who ſaid it cures the Quartan Ague. But ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many others reject this Conceit, as being founded upon no reaſon, becauſe the foreſaid Vein is a Branch iſſuing from the Arm Veins. Yet being commended by others with many Experiments, I conceive it ought not wholly to be neglected. Some hold, it ought to be opened in the Conjunction of the Moon with the Sun; others when the Moon inclines two hours before the Fit, at three ſeveral times, in three immediately ſucceeding Fits, which in ſome perſons hath happened very well.</p>
                        <p>After theſe firſt Evacuations, we muſt bend our ſtudy to concoct and prepare the Humors, with certain Juleps, compounded after this, or ſome ſuch manner:</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Roots of Aſparagus, Bruſcus, Cichory, Bugloſs ſteeped in white Wine, of each one ounce: Bark of Tamarisk half an ounce: Leaves of Borrage, Bugloſs, Ceterach, Maiden-hair, Fumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, Germander, Ground-pine, of each one handful: Liquoris one ounce: the three Cordial Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, of each one pugil. Boyl all to a pint and an half. In the ſtrained Liquor diſſolve</hi> Syrupus Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zantinus, <hi>and Syrup of Maiden-hair, of each two ounces. Make thereof a Julep to be taken at four times, four mornings together. Which muſt alſo be continued many daies, for the Matter being contumacious, requires long preparation. Or if the Patient be nice, and ſqueezy, Broths muſt be made of part of the foreſaid Simples, chuſing ſuch as are moſt grateful to the taſt, whereunto, as alſo to the Juleps, Cream of Tartar may profitably be added.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>With theſe Preparative Medicaments, between whiles, Purgatives muſt be given; ſo that every third or fourth day the Patient muſt take a Purge, with this Caution, That as long as the Matter is very crude, we uſe mild Purgatives: and when Concoction begins to go well forwards, we muſt then give ſuch Purgers as are a little ſtronger. Now the Materials for theſe Purgations are very wel known, ſo we need not reckon them up.</p>
                        <p>It is ſomtimes good to preſcribe an Apozem both Purgative and Preparative, for four or five Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that a good part of the Morbifick Matter may be clenſed away. Which Apozeme may be made of the Materials of the foreſaid Juleps, adding Purgatives thereunto. But if the thickneſs and contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of the Humors, with the cold diſtemper of the Bowels, do ſeem to threaten that the Diſeaſe wil be long and bring a Dropſie, we muſt then fly to ſuch Medicaments as do powerfully cut and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the ſaid Humors; of which this following Apozeme may be compounded.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>of the five opening Roots ſteeped in white Wine, of each one ounce: Enula Campana, Gentian, Ariſtolochia, and Aſarum Roots, of each half an ounce: Leaves of Germander, Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, Hops, Borrage, Ceterach, Wormwood, and Centaury, of each one handful: Liquoris, and Raiſons ſtoned, of each one ounce: Senna one ounce and an half: Epithimum one ounce: Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick newly trochiſcated three ounces: Ginger and Cloves, of each one dram: Boyl all to a pint and an half. In the ſtrained Liquor diſſolve Syrup of Cichory with Rhubarb five ounces: Troches of Capars, and Salt of Wormwood, and of Tamarisk, of each one dram. Make of all an Apozeme, for five Doſes to be taken in the morning.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In this Chronick and laſting Diſeaſe, an obſtinate Perſeverance is neceſſary, that the perpetual viciſſitude of Medicines may concoct and purge away the Cauſe thereof. For this is in a manner the only Cauſe why many that have Quartan Agues remain uncured, becauſe after the uſe of a few Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines they grow weary, and wholly reject and diſdain all the reſt.</p>
                        <p>For a continual Uſe therefore, certain Purgatives are alwaies to be in a readineſs. Which may be made in the form of a Magiſtral Syrup, or of Pils, or in any other form.</p>
                        <p>A Magiſtral Syrup may be made of the Materials of the Apozeme Aforeſaid, adding a triple quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the Purgative Ingredients.</p>
                        <p>Pils for frequent uſe may be thus compounded:</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Aloes diligently ſteeped with the Juyce of Wormwood, half an ounce: Gum Ammoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack diſſolved in Vinegar, and afterward thickened, two drams: choyce Mirrh a dram and an half: Gummy, Turbith, and Agarick newly made into Cakes, of each two drams: Diagridium one dram: Salt of Wormwood and Tamarisk, of each two ſcruples: Saffron half a ſcruple. With Oxymel ſimple, make all into a Maſs of Pill-ſtuff. Let the Doſe be half a dram, or two ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, twice in a week.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If the Patient be of an hot Conſtitution, theſe following Pills may be uſed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="590" facs="tcp:49088:268"/>Take <hi>Polypody of the Oak half an ounce: Roots of Aſarum, and ſeeds of Broom, of each one dram: Criſtal of Tartar one dram and an half: Flowers of Bugloſs and Borrage, of each half a pugil. Boyl all in a ſufficient Quantity of Water, Of the Liquor ſtrained, and very well clarified, take half a pint: Juyce of odoriferous Apples very well clarified four ounces. Infuſe therein Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na one ounce: Turbith and Agarick, of each three drams: Mace, Cloves, Cinnamon, and Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thimum, of each one dram. Let them digeſt together three daies in</hi> Balneo Mariae, <hi>then ſtrain and preſs them out. And add yet of Extract of Aloes made with Endive and Sorrel Water one ounce: Mirrh diſſolved in Wine over the fire and ſtrained two drams: Salt of Tartar one dram: Let all evaporate and thicken over a gentle fire, adding towards the concluſion, of the Pouders of Diarrho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don Abbatis, and Laetificans Galeni, of each one ſcruple: Salt of Wormwood and Tamarisk, of each half a dram: Extract of Saffron half a ſcruple. Make a Maſs of Pill-ſtuf for the uſe aſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Alſo a Purging Medicament very familiar, and moſt eaſie to prepare, but very profitable, may be made of three ounces of the Decoction of Wormwood, wherein two drams of Senna hath been infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, which muſt be taken now and then.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Purging Medicines are wont to be given the day before the fit, becauſe the Patients are then ſtronger than at other times. Yet many contend that they ought to be given before the fit, becauſe the matter being agitated by the fit, is made more apt for Expulſion. This Opinion they underprop with the Authority of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his Book <hi>de Affectionibus,</hi> who would have a Medicine Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging downwards to be given at the beginning of the Fit. And although in <hi>Galens</hi> Judgment, that is none of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his writings, but of his Son in Law <hi>Polypus;</hi> yet they conceive it ought not therefore to be of no Authority, ſeeing <hi>Polypus</hi> alſo was a very Learned Man, and frequent Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence confirms this Opinion; as the ſaid Experience is ſet down by <hi>Arculanus, Genitilus, Amatus Luſitanus,</hi> and others, who have ordered that the Purging Medicament ſhould be given four hours before the Fit. Which practice notwithſtanding, hath need of much warineſs and prudence in the Phyſitian, ſeeing the ſhaking fit intercepts the evacuation, and in the Ague Fit the Humors are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with a motion quite contrary to that wherewith the Purge doth move them; by which means great diſturbances may fall out in the Patients Body. Wherefore this courſe is not to be followed but in ſtrong Bodies.</p>
                        <p>The Conſent of Phyſitians is greater and more general touching the giving of Vomits in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Ague Fits, becauſe Nature is at that time more prone to that kind of Evacuation. Neither is it to be doubted, that a Vomiting cauſed in the beginning of the Fit, and at the ſame time often repeated, doth make the Diſeaſe gentler and ſhorter. The Materials of Vomitories are ſet down in our Cure of a Tertian. But in a Quartan Ague, Aſarum is preferred before the reſt, one dram being given in Pouder, in white Wine, and three or four times repeated.</p>
                        <p>In the Intervals of purging, Clyſters muſt frequently be given, which do accuſtom Nature to expel the hurtful Humors into the Guts, and do by little and little bring away ſome of the morbifick mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contained in the Meſeraick Veins.</p>
                        <p>The Diſeaſe continuing (as for the moſt part it is long and laſting) we muſt ſomtimes reſt, and abſtain from Phyſick a month, or thereabouts; that Nature in the mean time may gather ſtrength, be wearied with continual uſe of Medicaments, and may ſet her ſelf to concoct the morbifick matter. And afterward we muſt return to our Preparatives and Purgatives.</p>
                        <p>Howbeit, in a long Ague, we muſt not alwaies uſe the ſame Medicaments; leſt Nature be over much uſed thereunto, and the Patient become weary of them. Alſo becauſe from more gentle Ape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritives and Purgatives, we muſt paſs on to ſuch as are ſtronger. Various ſorts of Purgatives have been already propounded. And theſe following Aperitives beſides the Apozems aforeſaid, and the Juleps, may be uſed in the progreſs of the Diſeaſe, when the Signs of Digeſtion begin to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>White Wine three pints: Enula Campane Roots three ounces: Bark of Capar Roots half an ounce: Tops of common Wormwood dried one ounce: Infuſe them three daies in</hi> Balneo Mariae. <hi>Reep all together without ſtraining, and give of this Wine to the Patient two or three ounces in the morning, two hours before meat.</hi> And theſe following Pils may be uſed either alone, or with the ſaid Wine.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Roots of Gentian two drams: round Birthwort Roots one dram and an half: Mugwort one dram: Briony dried three drams: Mirrh and Saffron, of each one dram: Aſarum Roots two drams: Aloes one ounce: With Oxymel of Squils make all into a Maſs of Pill-ſtuf. Let a dram be given every day by themſelves, or a little before the taking of the Wine aforeſaid.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To theſe Pils, Steel prepared may profitably be added, if the Patient be able to walk after the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of them. For the uſe of Steel in all Chronick Feavers is very profitable, becauſe it potently o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens Contumacious Obſtructions, which are wont to foſter thoſe Diſeaſes.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="591" facs="tcp:49088:268"/>Or to open and ſtrengthen at once, the following Electuary may profitably be preſcribed.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Conſerve of Elecampane Roots, Conſerve of Wormwood, and Maiden-hair, of each one ounce: Preſerved Citron Peels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> half an ounce: Confectio Alkermes three drams: Preſerved Myrobalans, two: Pouder of Diarrhodon Abbatis two drams: Salt of Wormwood and Tama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risk, of each one dram: Saffron two ſcruples. With Syrup of preſerved Citrons, make all into an Opiate: of which let the Patient take the quantity of a Cheſtnut every morning, two hours before meat. Or if in the morning the Patient take ſome other Medicine, then may the Electuary be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken two hours before Supper.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To the ſame intent is commended as a moſt excellent Remedy, the Extract of Germander mixt with Salt of Tamarisk made into Pils.</p>
                        <p>Add hereunto, Diſcuſſers, and Diaphoreticks, which are very uſeful to diſcuſs the reliques of the declining Diſeaſe, when ſigns of Concoction appear. For they do not only diſcuſs the ſaid reliques, but they do likewiſe correct that diſtemper which is bred by ſo long a Diſeaſe, and amend the ill ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of the Body; and ſtrengthen the Stomach, Liver, and other Bowels, weakened by the length of the Diſeaſe. Among theſe Medicaments, Venice Treacle challengeth the firſt place, being by older and later Phyſitians commended to this Uſe. It is given one hour before the fit, one dram in weight, with Wine, or in a Decoction of Germander. Or if its heat be feared, it may be given with a Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Agrimony, or with the Juyce or Water of Plantane. This Medicine muſt be repeated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore divers Fits one after another. It may alſo be given in the mornings for ſome daies together on the well-daies. But a little before the fit, it operates happily, becauſe it hinders the encreaſe of cold, and doth more commodiouſly diſcuſs the Humor, which is cauſe of the fit, now beginning to work in the Veins, and by this means it diminiſheth the fit, and if the morbifick matter be little, takes it quite away. Here, notwithſtanding, great Caution is to be uſed, leſt Treacle, or other ſuch hot Medicines, ſhould be given when the Humors are yet crude; for they diſſolve the putrid Humors, from whence ariſeth a confuſion in the Body, and an encreaſe of the Ague Fits; ſo that a ſingle Quartan comes to degenerate into a Double, and Triple, yea, into a Continual Feaver. As it happened to <hi>Eudemus</hi> the Peripatetick, as <hi>Galen</hi> relates in <hi>Lib. de Praecog. ad Poſth. Cap. 2. &amp;</hi> 3. in whom was a ſingle Quartan, the Phyſitians of <hi>Rome</hi> having given him Treacle unſeaſonably, was changed into a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Howbeit, afterwards when the Signs of Concoction appeared, <hi>Galen</hi> gave him of the ſame Treacle, and cured him.</p>
                        <p>Among other Diaphoreticks, ſome commend the Roots of China, and Salſa parilla, whoſe firſt and ſecond Decoction being given twenty daies together, doth ſomtimes cure contumacious Quartans. But they work more effectually, if with the Primary Decoction, Purgatives be ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
                        <p>Other Remedies are alſo given before the Fit, which are accounted ſpecifical, and appropriate to this Ague, and being given towards the declination, they do very often keep back the fits, and cure the Quartan. The chief of this ſort, are theſe which follow:</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Green Leaves of Plantane one handful: Green Sorrel half a handful: Vinegar and Treacle, of each three ounces. Diſtil them, and let the Patient take of the diſtilled Liquor three ounces, half an hour before the fit.</hi> Or,</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Sugar-candy three drams: Ginger two drams: Camphire one dram. Make all into a Pouder. Give one dram in warm Water.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Ten Grains of Saffron in pouder, given with white Wine before the fit, doth much weaken the ſame.</p>
                        <p>Seed of wild Rue given before the Fit in white Wine, cures.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Heurnius</hi> aſſures us that with the following Troches, many have been cured, even in the Winter, with once taking.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Seeds of Rue, Parſley, Mirrh, and new Andromachus Treacle, of each one dram: Opium half a ſcruple: Make all up into little Cakes or Troches. And let the Patient take one of thoſe Cakes in Water, before the fit. Narcoticks do indeed much abate the fits; but unleſs the greateſt part of the morbifick Humor have been before abated, and the Obſtructions much leſſened, they may do hurt, becauſe they may retain the vitious Humors in the Body, and breed Obſtructions, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worſe Diſeaſes. But given in a ſmal quantity, and mingled with things which open and cut, as in theſe Troches, they can do leſs hurt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Alſo to reſtrain the Fit, gentle Purgers are profitably given an hour before it comes, which do revel the Humors, more by ſoliciting and provoking Nature, than by their purging. To which intent, ſuch as theſe which follow are preſcribed.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Senna, Polipody of the Oak, Time, Epithimum, of each one dram: Borrage flowers a pugil. Make a Decoction to three ounces. Give it an hour before the Fit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Or,</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Senna three drams: Turbith one dram: Cinnamon half a dram: Saffron and Ginger,
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:49088:269"/>
of each ten grains: Sugar, the weight of all the reſt. Make of all a Pouder, divide it into three parts. Give the Patient one part before the fit, in white Wine.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Quercetanus</hi> in his Diſpenſatory, doth exceedingly commend <hi>Camillus</hi> his Pils of Sagape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num; of which he gives only one at the beginning of the fit, for divers daies together; and a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he anoints their Back-bone with a Liniment compoſed of Treacle, <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> Oyl of Bays, or of Spike. And two or three hours after the Pils are taken, he gives Broth with opening Roots, Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, Bugloſs, Time, and an odoriferous Apple boyled in it.</p>
                        <p>Now thoſe anointings of the Back-bone, are very good to mitigate the cold fit, and muſt often be uſed, although the foreſaid Pils are not uſed. For they are frequently uſeful, when the ſhaking fits are vehement and importunate. And theſe Anointings are made, not only with the foreſaid, but with very many other Medicaments; as with Oyl of Dill, Chamomel, Orice, Coſtus, Rue, the Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and other hot things, with <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> Treacle, Cloves, Caſtoreum, Muſtard ſeed, Pepper, and other things mixed therewith. Now theſe Liniments are more effectual, if the back-bone be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed therewith by the fire-ſide, an hour before the coming of the fit; and the ſick party be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently thereupon conveighed to a hot bed, and hot Tiles ſprinkled with odoriferous Wine, and wrapped in Linnen Cloths, be applied to the Soals of the Feet, and Palms of the Patients Hands.</p>
                        <p>While the aforeſaid Medicaments are uſed, a ſpecial care muſt be had of the Spleen, becauſe that part is alwaies affected in this Diſeaſe: And therefore thoſe Medicaments which ordinarily are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed for Obſtructions of the Spleen, viz. Fomentations, Liniments, and Plaiſters.</p>
                        <p>Yea verily, and ſomtimes a Bath of luke-warm Water, after many Evacuations have been celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is good, not only to mollifie the Spleen, but alſo to moiſten the whol body, and to further the Coction of the morbifick matter. The bath may be uſed on the daies of intermiſſion, giving dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent heed that it be no other than luke-warm. For if it ſhould be hotter, it is to be feared, leſt the Humors being thereby diſſolved, ſhould run on a ſudden into divers parts of the Body, and breed dangerous, very dangerous Impoſthumes.</p>
                        <p>Finally, Such things as are wont to be laid to the Wriſts, are not to be neglected, ſeeing Authors of good account do make ſome reckoning of them. For <hi>Rondeletius</hi> affirms, That he hath uſed this following Medicament, with great ſucceſs.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Leaves of Elder, Sage, Doves-foot, Rue, of each half a handful: Marigolds a third part: a handful of Salt, and a little Wine. Beat all together, and apply to the Wriſts before the Fit.</hi> Crato <hi>applies the Roots of Nettles being beaten and moiſtened or ſteeped in Vinegar, to the Arteries of the Wriſts, and of the Feet. And</hi> Sennertus <hi>relates that a certain Citizen having had a Quartan Auge the whol Autumn and VVinter, and at laſt being afflicted with moſt ſharp pains in his left ſhoulder, by the perſwaſion of a certain woman, he applied Crowfoot to his wriſt, which raiſed a Puſh, and freed him both from his pain and Feaver.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A Baſtard Quartan is cured with the ſame Medicines in a manner, which have been propounded for the Cure of a Tertian; adding to the Decoction of Juleps and Apozems, ſuch things as do peculiarly regard Melancholly aduſt. Whereunto may be added al the more temperate, and leſs heating Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which have hitherto been propounded for a Legitimate Quartan.</p>
                        <p>In the beginning therefore it is good to uſe Borrage, Bugloſs, Fumitory, Hops, Sorrel, Cichory, Ceterach, Scolopendria, Agrimony, and Odoriferous Apples. Whoſe Decoctions, diſtilled Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and ſomtimes their clarified Juyces may be preſcribed in the form of a Julep, an Apozeme or Magiſtral Syrup.</p>
                        <p>But in the Progreſs of the Diſeaſe, it will be good to add unto the Simples afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, the Bark of Capar Roots, of Tamarisk, Enula Campana, Polypodie, and Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood.</p>
                        <p>While the Patient uſeth theſe Preparatives, Purgatives are frequently to be interpoſed; which are to be given the Day before the Fit, and to be repeated twice a Week. To which Intent Various Forms may be preſcribed. But for ſuch as are Delicate, a Laxative Ptiſan, <hi>Syrupus de Pomis Saporis,</hi> or the Broth of a Chicken, qualified with Borrage, Bugloſs, Pim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernel, and three drams, or half an ounce of Senna, may profitably be given.</p>
                        <p>Blood-letting in the beginning muſt not be omitted, and ſo ſuch quantity of blood muſt be taken away, as ſhal correſpond unto the Quantity and Quality of Blood, and to the Age and Conſtitution of the Patient.</p>
                        <p>If the Diſeaſe prove long, when the fervor of the blood is abated, Vomits may profitably be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred; eſpecially to ſuch Patients as are troubled with Stomach-ſickneſs and Vomitings in the beginning of their Fits. Among Vomitories good for a Quartan, Aſarum (as was ſaid before) is the principal, being given to the quantity of a dram in white Wine, and divers times repeated, if the Diſeaſe ſhal not after once or twice giving, be diſcuſſed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="593" facs="tcp:49088:269"/>Hereunto ad fomentations and liniments applied to the parts under the ſhort ribs, to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the evil diſpoſition of the bowels (which continually affords new matter for the fits) and to ſoften and make thin the faſt, ſetled and impacted Humors: which may be preſcribed after this manner.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Roots of Marſh-mallows, of Lillies, of Enula campana, Barks of capar Roots, and the middle rind of Tamarisk, of each one ounce; Leaves of Mallows, of Marſh-mallows, of Pellitory of the wall, of Borrage, Bugloſs, Pimpernel, Wormwood of each one handfull; Lin-ſeed and Parſly ſeed, of each an half ounce; flowers of Chamomel, Melilot and Dill, of each one pugil: make a decoction in three parts of water, and one of white wine added towards the end. With which decoction foment the Hypochondria, twice a day, far from meals.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Ointment of Marſh-mallowes, one ounce and an half; Oyl of Lillies, Chamomel, Roſes and Wormwood, of each an half ounce: make al into a Liniment, which muſt be uſed after the fomenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Or Oyls alone may profitably be applied to the ſame Parts, laid on with wool.</p>
                        <p>And finally a bath of warm water either alone or with emollient and qualifiing things boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therein, or of Barly and Almonds as is uſual, will be very convenient to cure this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. For it corrects the diſtemper of the bowels, rectifies the heat and dryneſs of black Choller, mollifie that which is hard, opens the paſſages and widens them, and digeſts crude Humors. Wherefore the frequent uſe thereof will be moſt convenient, uſing the caution before ſpecified.</p>
                        <p>Now the operation thereof will be exceedingly advanced, if preparative Medicaments and ſuch as open obſtruction be given to the patient, upon entrance into the bath. Among which the chief is a decoction of Wormwood and Enula Campana, which is exceeding good to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt all contumacious Humors. provided the over great heat of the Bowels, do not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the uſe thereof. In which caſe it may be tempered by the mixture of other things fore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited.</p>
                        <p>And while theſe things are doing, gentle purgations muſt be repeated, as we adviſed before. And when the diſeaſe doth indeed decline, thoſe ſpecified medicaments propounded in the Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Quartan, may here alſo be brought into uſe.</p>
                        <p>In the whol courſe of the diſeaſe we muſt be carefull of the Breaſt, leaſt a Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betide the ſame, for the Humor offending in this Diſeaſe is of a corroding quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>GAlen</hi> in his ſecond Book <hi>de Criſib.</hi> cap. 7. and 9. and in his ſecond Book <hi>de Differ. Feb.</hi> Cap. 7. and <hi>Avicen. Fen 1. Lib 4. Tract</hi> 4. Cap. 16. Do propound many compoſitions of Feavers. Namely when putrid Feavers are compounded with non-putrid, as when an hectick is joyned with a putrid; or of a putrid with a putrid, which is done many wayes viz. Either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall Feavers being complicated with continuall or intermittent with intermitent, or continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all with intermitent.</p>
                        <p>The Compoſition of two continual Feavers, is a thing controverted among authors, and a man ſhall hardly obſerve it in the courſe of his practice.</p>
                        <p>An intermitting Feaver or Ague is complicated with another intermittent, either of the ſame kind, or different: compound intermittents of the ſame kind are a double and triple Tertian, and a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or triple quartan, which have been expounded in their proper places. Of ſeveral kinds are when a tertian is compounded with a Quotidian or quartan; which alſo is very rarely ſeen in Practice.</p>
                        <p>Intermittents are complicated with continuals two waies viz. An intermittent tertian with a continual Quotidian, or a Quotidian intermittent with a continual tertian. and each of theſe is termed a Semi-tertian, conſtituting Species or ſorts thereof.</p>
                        <p>Yet that is properly and truly a Semi-tertian which is made of an intermitting Tertian and a continual quotidian: and conſequently is cauſed from choller putrefying without and flegm putrefying within the veſſels. By <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> in 1 <hi>Epidem.</hi> it is named <hi>Horrifica,</hi> or the ſhaking Ague becauſe it cauſes the patient to ſhake, not only at the firſt coming of the fit, but in the whol courſ of the diſeaſe and eſpecially in the beginning and augment, two fits being met and joyned in one, viz: Of the tertian and quotidian Ague, with many reduplications, which are nothing elſe but unequal ſhaking and ſhivering motions, returning divers time in one and the
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:49088:270"/>
ſame Ague Fit, by reaſon of the mutual fight of the two Feavers; in which, if Flegm overcome, there will follow ſhiverings, and coldneſs of the extream parts. And then again, when Choller doth van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh, the Body becomes warm, and the Feaver ſeems to tend towards the vigor; whenas flegm a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain getting the better, they are again brought into a cold and ſhivering condition; and this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is wont to laſt til the Feaver comes to its height. Hence it is that thoſe ſhaking fits come only every other day, viz. When the fit of the Tertian Ague is upon the Patient, being joyned with the Quotidian.</p>
                        <p>But while the Quotidian alone is preſent, there is wont to be no ſhivering Fit. Yet we muſt take notice, That there are ſome Malignant Feavers, which without a commixion of a Tertian and Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidian, without that ſame fight of Choller and Flegm, do ſhake the Patient; in which the Shive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verings come from ſharp Vapors, and malignant, which do ariſe out of the corrupt Matter of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Feavers, and do beat upon, and pull the ſenſitive parts, and nip or twitch them as it were.</p>
                        <p>Now this Semi-Tertian properly ſo called, is either exquiſite, wherein an equal portion of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefying Choller and Flegm is redundant, ſuch as hath been now deſcribed; or it is a baſtard Semi-Tertian, which is again two-fold: For either it hath Choller abounding, or Flegm. In the former there are more Symptoms of a Tertian; in the latter of a Quotidian. And ſo if Choller abound, the whol Feaver is more horrid, and ſomtimes it hath a ſhaking fit accompanying the ſame; alſo it proves more fervent, and ſome portion of Choller is voided forth by vomit, ſtool, or ſweat. But when Flegm prevails, a more vehement cold doth poſſeſs the extream parts of the Body, and there are few ſhiverings; and the pulſe it more and longer depreſſed, and the fit is longer before it grow towards its height, and remains in its conſiſtency a long time; yet doth it cauſe no great thirſt, nor burning.</p>
                        <p>This Feaver is known by what hath been ſaid thereof, being continual, and cold, with many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duplications, and very great Symptomes. Becauſe it comes every other day with a ſhaking cold fit; but upon the even daies it comes only with a coldneſs in the extream parts of the Body. The Urines are crude, thin, and without color; ſomtimes troubled, with no Sediment, or that which bodes no good. The Pulſe is frequent and unequal. The Differences are known by the Signs of more or leſs of Choller and Flegm, propounded.</p>
                        <p>As for the Prognoſtick of this Feaver, it is a dangerous Diſeaſe, and therein the Stomach and Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous parts are very much affected. And it is attended with dryneſs of the Tongue, Thirſt, Swoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Watching, and ſomtimes with Ravings, and dead Sleeps. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> reckons it among acute Diſeaſes becauſe of the Choller; and among Chronick Diſeaſes becauſe of the Flegm, in 1. Epidem. And <hi>Avicenna</hi> ſaith, That it laſts ſomtimes ſeven months, and ſomtimes ends in Chronick Diſeaſes, and an Hectick.</p>
                        <p>The Cure of this Feaver is to be taken from what hath been formerly ſaid of the Cure of a Tertian, and a Quotidian Ague; and ſeeing it is continual, it muſt be handled with the ſame Method which was ſet down in the firſt Chapter of this Section, as common to all putrid continual Feavers. So that when Choller chiefly bears ſway, we muſt uſe moſt of thoſe Simples which reſpect Choller; and when as flegm prevails, we muſt principally uſe ſuch things as do prepare and purge that Humor. And finally, When both Humors are equal, the Remedies proper to each muſt be uſed in equal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion likewiſe.</p>

                        <p>All <hi>Authors (very neer) who have writ of Feavers, do diſtinguiſh a peſtilential Feaver from a malignant, and doe treat of each of them ſeverally in divers Chapters; ſo that by the name of a peſtilential Feaver they doe underſtand the true Peſtilence or Plague; and by a ſuch malignant Feaver, they mean that which is commonly called the sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

But for as much as theſe Feavers differ one from another only according to the greater or leſſer degree of malignity, and muſt be cured with the ſame Medicaments; we have thought it more convenient to include al theſe kind of Feavers in one Chapter, and to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle them all under the name of Peſtilential Feavers. and conſequently this laſt Section ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of two Chapters, the firſt of which ſhall treat of the Peſtilentiall Feaver; and the later of the Meaſles and ſmall Pox: For ſeeing a Malignant Feaver does allwaies attend them all Authors doe juſtly treat of them in this place.</hi>

                           <hi>Chap. 1.</hi> Of a Peſtilential Feaver.</head>
                        <p>That Feaver is termed Peſtilential, which does afflict Nature not only by a bare diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or by heat ariſing from putrefaction, but alſo with a Maliguant and venemous quality. This is wont to be for the moſt part Popular and Epidemical; ſo that many are at the ſame time ſick thereof: yet ſomtimes it is ſporadick or ſingle afflicting but here and there one, which ariſes from evil Humors that have attained a venemous quality.</p>
                        <p>It is likewiſe Contagious, ſo that it may be caught not only by means of the common Cauſe, Viz. Corruption of the Air or Diet; but alſo by Converſing with thoſe that are ſick.</p>
                        <p>It is alſo commonly called a Malignant Feaver, whereas many diſeaſes are termed Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. by reaſon of their evil and cruel ſymptomes in which no venemous quality is found, in which alone the eſſence of a Peſtilential diſeaſe conſiſts.</p>
                        <p>In what Feaver ſoever therefore, this ſame venemous quality is found, whether it be a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, an hectick, or a putrid Feaver, it is rightly termed Peſtilentiall: although a dairy and hect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick are much controverted, touching which conſult the Authors.</p>
                        <p>Now this ſame venemous quality ariſeth from the corruption of Homors, which conſiſts not in a bare change of the temperament, or in ordinary putreſaction, ſuch as is found in putrid Feavers; but in a deſtruction of the whol Nature and Eſſential ſubſtance of the ſame Humors. As Wine when it is turned an ioſipid taſtleſs Liquor, is totally and eſſentially corrupted; but when it becomes vinegar, it is ſaid ſimply to putrefie.</p>
                        <p>And a Peſtilentiall Feaver differs from the Plague as a ſpecies or ſort differs from the genus or kind, becauſe there may be a Peſtilence without a Feaver, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> hath taught us in his third Epidem, in many places; and alſo <hi>Galen</hi> in his Expoſition of the ſaid Book. and in his ninth Book, <hi>de Medic. Facultatib. Cap. de Terra Samia.</hi> And this is ſutable to Reaſon forasmuch as the venemous Quality is not neceſſarily attended with putrefaction, which is the Cauſe of a Feaver. For that ſame venemous qualitie may be produced in the Humors, by a perfect corruption of their ſubſtance, and introduction of a new form, of which that vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous qualitie depends. And certain it is, that ſo oft as a new from is introduced, the former is corrupted; unto which mutations there are requiſite preparatorie alterations, but not putrefaction ſo that Humors may undergo ſuch a corruption without putrefaction; but becauſe the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors of our body are very liable to putrefaction, they can rarely undergo ſo great a corruption, without the Intervention of putrefaction likewiſe; wherefore thoſe Peſtilences are very rare, which are not accompanied with a Feaver: Yea verily and by an intenſe, profound and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did (as they are wont to ſay) putrefaction, ſuch a Corruption as that of the Plague is wont to
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:49088:272"/>
be raiſed. So, many Feavers, which at firſt were not peſtilentiall, if by the Ignorance of the Phyſitian or negligence, the diſobedience of the Sick, or the fierceneſs of externall cauſes, they have been miſ-handled, the putrefaction becomeing more intenſe, they turn in the end to malignant and Peſtilentiall Feavers. And that corruption does often precede Putrefaction is collected from ſuch as are infected with the Plague by contagion; in whom a malignant, and venemous qualitie is firſt tranſfuſ'd, and therewith the Humors are corrupted, which corruption is followed by putrefaction, whence it comes to pas that ſuch as have the Peſtilence have ſometimes no feaver for the firſt daies of their ilneſs; but afterwards the Feaver begins to ſhew it ſelf, when putrefaction is bred; ſome ſuch things we ſee in a part that is affected with a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene, which is firſt corrupted, and afterwards puertfied.</p>
                        <p>A peſtilentiall Feaver is cauſed, when the Humors being corrupted and haveing attained a venemous quality, doe come to putrefie: And ſo it affects the Heart by thoſe two meanes Viz. By a putrid heat and a malignant qualitie.</p>
                        <p>Now this corruption of Humors, is not alwaies after one ſort, but ſomtimes it is more intenſe and ſomtimes leſs and according to its divers degrees, the venemous qualitie ariſing therefrom is more or leſs pernicious; from whence proceeds the greater or leſs Malignity of Feavers. And hence aroſe that common diſtinction of Peſtilential Feavers among Phyſitians, into a Peſtilential feaver ſimply and properly ſo called and into a Malignant Feaver; calling that a peſtilentiall Feaver properly ſo termed wherein is the true Plague; having this peculiar, note or character, that more die than live and recover; and calling that ſimply a malignant Feaver which being leſs pernicious, more live than die of it.</p>
                        <p>The differences of a Peſtilentiall Feaver are taken either from the matter wherein that venemous Quality is produced; or from the place wherein the ſaid matter is contained: and ſo they follow the difference of putrid Feavers, which in reſpect of the matter of putrefing are divided into the Feaver <hi>Sunochos, Tertiana, Quartana,</hi> and <hi>Quotidiana,</hi> according as the matter pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefiing it, Blood, Choller, Melancholy, or Flegm. And in reſpect of the place wherein the Humors putrefie, they are divided into continuall and intermittent; according as the aforeſaid Humors are lodged within or without the veines: even ſo peſtilential Feavers, ſome are termed Synochi, others Tertians, Quartans or Quotidians; ſome continuall, others intermittent: though <hi>Hippocrates</hi> hath ſaid in the 43. Aphoriſm of the 4 Section, That intermitting Feave<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> are void of danger however they intermit, which only is to be underſtood of ſuch as are void of all malignitie; for we ſee almoſt <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>every year (in our country at leaſt) tertian intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Feavers, which being extreamly malignant, doe at the third or fourth fit kill the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients: others which bring them into great danger, eſpecially by the crueltie of the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes.</p>
                        <p>There are other Differences of a peſtilential Feaver taken from the intenſnes of their degree or Remiſſneſs; namly, as ſome ate greater, other leſſer, ſome partake of greater malignitie ſome of leſſer. They are ſaid to be ſimply greater or leſſer, according as the Putrefaction is greater or leſs, or as the preternatural Heat ariſeing therefrom, is more intenſe or remiſs; more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant or benignant, according to the greater or leſs intenſion of the venemous quality Hence it comes to paſs, that ſometimes a peſtilentiall Feaver hath extream putrefaction, and malignancy at the higheſt; and then it is wont to be moſt fierce, and therein in regard of the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy the vital faculty is exceedingly afflicted; and in regard of the extream putrefaction, the other faculties are likewiſe hurt, and cruell ſymptoms follow thereupon. But ſometimes in this Feaver the putrefaction is very high, and the malignant qualitie remiſs; and then the Feaver is trouble-ſom by reaſon of the putrefaction; but the vital faculty is leſs afflicted. Contrarilie ſomtimes Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction is little, but the malignant quality intenſe: and then the Feaver in regard of putrefaction ſhews no ſuch bad ſymptoms &amp; ſeems remiſs; yet the ſtrength of the patient is more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily weakned. For ſomtimes the putrefaction is ſo remiſs that it is in a manner none at all; but the malignant quality in a very high degree: and then we have a Feaver, which ſeems neither to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient nor by ſtanders any thing troubleſom; but it ſeems at firſt ſight mild, as mild can be, when as indeed and intruth it is very mortall; for when the malignant qualitie is increaſed, the patients ſtrength is dejected, and the Heart wholly overwhelmed: and this kind of Feaver doth not only deceive the Patients and by-ſtanders, but ſomtimes the Phyſitians themſelves are thereby cheated; whiles there being no ſign preſent either by crudity or pravity of Humors, the Pulſe being in a manner in it's natural ſtate, and the heat of the Body at firſt appearance ſeeming mild and gentle, it leads unto deſtruction. Som ſuch thing is likewiſe wont to happen in the firſt difference, viz. When it is joyned with the higheſt degree of malignity: for putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction being by convenient medicaments ſubdued, and the ſignes of recovery appearing; death notwithſtanding ſomtimes enſues by reaſon the malignant quality did remaine uncorrected.</p>
                        <p>And finally the differences of a Peſtilent Feaver are taken from its adjuncts, and they are very
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:49088:272"/>
many and moſt evident, for there is no evil ſymptom, nor kind of deadly diſeaſe which is not ſomtimes joyned with this Feaver. The ſymptomes are Head-ach, Watchings, Raveings, Dead ſleepes, Thirſt, Stomach-Sickneſs, and Vomiting, want of Appetite, Swooning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Fainting, Hiccoughing, Unquietneſs Looſneſs, Sweats and ſuch like, which are common alſo to other kind of Feavers.</p>
                        <p>But there is one Symptom proper and peculiar to a peſtilential Feaver, which doth not happen in other Feavers; <hi>viz.</hi> Purple Specks, or Spots on the whol Body, but eſpecially in the Loyns, the breaſt and back, like unto Flea-bitings for the moſt part; which the Italian Phyſitians name <hi>Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culae</hi> or <hi>Petechiae;</hi> and theſe Feavers which have theſe Symptoms, are commonly named <hi>Purpura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae</hi> or <hi>Petechialis,</hi> Purple or Spotted Feavers. For theſe Purple Spots do not appear in all Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential Feavers; but when they appear, they are a moſt certain Sign of a peſtilential Feaver. Now we call them Purple Spots, becauſe they are for the moſt part of a Purple colour. Yet they are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times of a violet colour, Green, blewiſh, or black, and then they are far worſe, and do ſignifie greater Malignity. And although theſe Spots are for the moſt part like Flea-bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ings: yet they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſomwhat greater: So as to repreſent thoſe black and blew marks which remain after whipping, and then they are worſe. And ſomtimes they are very large, and poſſeſs whol Members, and a great part of the body; <hi>viz.</hi> the Arms, Thighs, and back, and then the parts appear tainted with redneſs; which in few hours oftentimes vaniſheth away, and then returns again, as it were by Fits, whilſt the Feaver undergoes it's Fits, or Exacerbations; wherein the blood boiling, doth ſend forth it's thinner Exhalations to the ſurface of the Skin, by which the Skin is not ſwelled; but only infected with a red Color. Oftentimes notwithſtanding, by theſe Ebullitions, the Skin is in divers parts puffed up with a certain redneſs: and makes certain broad and ſoft tumors in the Skin, which in a few hours vaniſh away, and are commonly called Ebullitions of the blood. In theſe, and the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, there is alwaies ſome Malignity, but ſo light, that it threatens no danger; unleſs in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the Diſeaſe it prove more intenſe. Now the Spots aforeſaid like to Flea-bitings, do differ from thoſe Puſhes, which are wont alſo ſomtimes to appear in theſe Feavers, and are mentioned by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in <hi>Epidemiis,</hi> which have an Head, and are a kind of Tumors, which come ſomtimes to Suppuration, or Exulceration. But the Purple Spots, have (as was ſaid) no eminence or Head, and were unknown to the Antients, being deſcribed only by later Phyſitians of after Ages.</p>
                        <p>As to thoſe Diſeaſes which are joyned to a Peſtilential Feaver, we may affirm what hath been ſaid of the Sym ptoms; <hi>viz.</hi> that many deadly Diſeaſes are joyned with theſe Feavers; namely, Phren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, Squ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>es, Pleuriſies, Inflamations of the Lungs, Inflamations of the Liver, bloody Fluxes, and very many more. But the chief Diſeaſes which ſhew themſelves in a Peſtilential Feaver, are two, <hi>viz.</hi> a Peſtilent <hi>Bubo,</hi> and a Carbuncle, which declare the venemous quality to be in the higheſt degree, and are not found but in the true Peſtilence, and are wont commonly to accompany the ſame: So that the common People call them by the very name of the Peſtilence.</p>
                        <p>The Cauſes of Peſtilential Feavers, are ſome Internal, others External: and the Internal are ſome Immediate, others Mediate.</p>
                        <p>The Immediate Cauſe of this Diſeaſe, as we hinted before, is a corruption of the Humors, joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with putrefaction. From the Corruption they acquire an evil and venemous Quality and from Putrefaction the Feaver is bred.</p>
                        <p>The Mediate Cauſes are a Plethory, Cacochymie, and Obſtructions. Now we underſtand ſuch a Plethory, or fulneſs of Blood; not as diſtends the Veſſels, but ſuch at leaſt as the ſtrength of the Patient cannot maſter, which not being regulated by Nature, doth eaſily undergo Corruption, and Putrefaction. Now a Cacochymie, or abundance of evil Humors, is eaſily corrupted and putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Finally, Obſtructions are apt to breed all kind of Feavers: foraſmuch as Humors being cloſe ſhut up in an hot and moiſt place, wanting free tranſpiration, do caſily putrefie. The Internal Mediate Cauſes, are by Authors commonly called <hi>Morboſus Apparatus,</hi> a ſickly Diſpoſition of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and the efficacy thereof is ſo great, that it alone is ſomtimes ſufficient to produce a gentle Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential Feaver, ſuch as is commonly called a Malignant Feaver ſimply, or a Purple Feaver, without the Intervention of any External or common Cauſe. For we oft-times ſee, when the year is not Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilential, and there is no Epidemical ſickneſs abroad, ſome perſons through the evil Condition of their Humors, fall into ſuch Feavers, which are accompanied with many Symptoms of Malignancy; yea, and with other Purple ſpots.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the point of Obſtruction, we muſt obſerve, that it doth neceſſarily concur as the principal Cauſe in Malignant Feavers, which proceed from Internal Cauſes, and are not Epidemical: but that Epidemical Feavers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which proceed from a common Cauſe; viz. A Peſtilent conſtitution of the Air, or are gotten by Contagion, have not neceſſarily any Obſtructions for their Cauſe. For the venemous quality is received only by breathing in the corrupt Air, or only by Infection from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, by which venemous Quality the Humors of the Body, declining from their own proper Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, do of their own accord putrefie. For even as Fruits that will not keep, and other things ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
                           <pb n="614" facs="tcp:49088:273"/>
to corrupt, though they have never ſo much freedom of the Air, yet cannot be preſerved from Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Even ſo the Humors, when they have conceived that pernitious Quality, are apt to Corrup-tion: ſo that though there be no Obſtruction preſent, they neceſſarily fall into a Putrefaction, and a Feaver. Howbeit, Putrefaction being by this means brought into the Humors, when Nature doth no longer rule them, they are wont for the moſt part to breed Obſtructions, whereby the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is augmented; ſo that in theſe Feavers Obſtructions may Concur, which though in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning they were not the Cauſe of the Feaver, yet do they follow the ſame, being cheriſhed by the Cauſes of the Feaver, and being infected with Peſtilential Venom.</p>
                        <p>The External Cauſes of Peſtilential Feavers, are the ſix Non-natural things, which as they are neceſſary, ſo do they neceſſarily alter our bodies: and when they are far departed from their Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral condition, they breed in us Malignant and venemous Qualities. Among theſe, the Air holds the chief place: which as it is a moſt common Cauſe, ſo Diſeaſes that are common doth for the moſt part proceed from ſome fault thereof.</p>
                        <p>Now the Air becomes vitious and hurtful to men, for the moſt part by a threefold means. Firſt, If it be not blown through with wholſom Winds. Secondly, If it be polluted with the Infection of putrid and ſtinking Exhalations. Thirdly, If by an exceſs or prepoſterous condition of the firſt Qualities, it doth ſo alter Men, that thereby evil and malignant putrefactions of the Humors be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred.</p>
                        <p>The firſt is evident enough. For if the Air be not blown through, and ſtirred with Winds, it is eaſily corrupted. Whence <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in the 3. Epidem. Deſcribing a moſt grievous Peſtilential con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, ſaith; This year had no Winds.</p>
                        <p>And the Second is moſt effectual and frequent, viz. When Putrid, Filthy, and malignant vapors are mingled with the Air, and do infect the ſame, which is wont to ariſe from divers things, viz. Lakes, Pooles, Fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

Or from the ſtink of Privies, Dung-hils, and naſty Allies. Or from the unburied bodies of ſuch as have bin ſlain in battle. Or out of Dens or Caves or Caves (wherein the Air having been longſhut up, hath gained a filthy putrefaction) being opened by an Earth-quake, or ſome other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>aſualtie.</p>
                        <p>But the third Reaſon, which conſiſts in the Exceſs, Inequality, or Prepoſterous condition of the firſt Qualities, may happen divers waies, and eſpecially when there is a great exceſs of Heat and moiſture. For thoſe Qualities, when they are extranious and adventitious, and encreaſed above their Natural condition, they are the principles of putrefactions. Hence a Southern Wind laſting long in the Seaſons of the year, according to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in Epidem. was the principal cauſe, of all Peſtilential Feavers there deſcribed.</p>
                        <p>But a dry Conſtitution of the Air, though in the Opinion of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> it's more wholſom than a moiſt; yet becauſe exceſs of Qualities, is hurtful to our Nature; certain it is that a very dry Conſtitution of the Air, more than ordinary, doth produce Peſtilential Feavers; eſpecially if it be joyned with Exceſſive Heat. A cleer example wherof we have in <hi>Livy</hi> in the firſt Book of his Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Decad. 4. viz. How by over great dryneſs, a Peſtilence happened at <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe there had been little or no Rain that year: neither was there ſcarcity of Water from Heaven alone; but the Earth was ſcarce able to continue her Springs. Now this dry Conſtitution doth therefore Cauſe the Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, becauſe the Humors being above meaſure burnt &amp; dried up, degenerate into the Matter of Biles, Carbuncles, and conſequently of a Peſtilential Feaver; and being very much thickned, they produce grievous Obſtructions; wherby in a matter otherwiſe wel diſpoſed therunto, Malignant putrefaction is eaſily bred. Add hereunto, That this immoderate dri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>It is proved alſo from <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> That immoderate Cold doth produce a Peſtilence 1. Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem.

Alſo we may read in Livy Lib. 5. Decad. 1. That a Peſtilential Seaſon was cauſed by vehement Cold; in theſe Words. <hi>The year was remarkable for a Cold, and Snowy Winter, ſo that the Wayes were ſtopped up, and the River</hi> Tyber <hi>was unnavigable.

That by reaſon the Pores of the Skin are cloſed up by the extream Cold, ſo that the vapors cannot ſteem forth ſo as naturally they ſhould, there follows the greater putrefaction, and more grievous poiſon; whereupon follows more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

feavers, than in the Summer, in which the condition of the air, although in ſome ſort it gives beginning to the Diſeaſe, yet doth it make the pores and paſſages wider, Through which that which putrified does exhale, and the natural and preternatural evaporations doe readily breath out.</p>
                        <p>Inequality of the Seaſon is wont alſo to be the Cauſe of this kind of Feavers; viz. when it is ſometimes Hot, ſometimes Cold; ſometimes wet, ſometimes dry in a ſhort time; or when theſe various ſeaſons doe endure longer one after another. As when after long vehement Hot weath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Or when after a prepoſterous faſhion, it is hot in Winter and cold in Summer. Now theſe inequalities of Seaſons may help the production of Peſtilential Feavers; becauſe in them, the humors are exceedingly diſturbed, by which means they arrive unto an evill condition, far from their natural ſtare and fit to produce malignant Diſeaſes eſpecially in thoſe bodies which du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Courſe of the Seaſons aforeſaid, by diſorderly Courſe of Diet and liveing, have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted either a Plethory a Cacochymy or ſome notable obſtructions.</p>
                        <p>To this kind of Cauſes may be added the malignant Influence of the Conſtellations, which by changeing the Ayr, are wont diverſly to affect the Bodies of Liveing Creatures. Such they ſay are, the Conjunction of the ſuperior Planets, <hi>Saturu, Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> in humane Signes, ſuch as <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgo and Gemini,</hi> and eſpecially when <hi>Mars</hi> is Lord. Which do bring Diſeaſes in otherwiſe they by change of the Ayr, ſo far as to corrupt the Nature and ſubſtance thereof. And that change is wrought two waies; and is by the manifeſt qualities, as when by the Influence of the Stars the ayr is ſo long and ſo far changed by exceſs of the firſt qualities of Heat, Moiſture, Cold and Dryneſs, that at length it's proper Subſtance becomes vitrated the other is by occult quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, when by the ſecret power of the Stars, without any notable exceſs of the firſt qualities the ſubſtance of the ayr is ſo changed, that it receives a certain degree of corruption contrary to our Life. Touching the firſt, no man doubts, ſeeing it is clear by Common Conſent of Phyloſophers that inferior Bodies are governed by the Heavenly Conſtellations. And as the alterations of the Ayr, which happen in the four ſeaſons of the yeer, do ariſe from the yeerly motion of the Sun: ſo the great diverſity of yeers, whereby one proves very moiſt, another exceeding dry the Sun holding every yeer the ſame Courſe in the Zodiack; can depend on nothing, but the various aſpects of the Conſtellations. The other way becauſe it is occult, is not ſo freely granted by all. How be it by common Conſent of Aſtrologers, it is held for certain, that the Stars do act upon inferior Bodies in a three-fold manner, viz. by their Motion, Light, and Influence The light and beat do alter theſe Sublunary Bodies according to the firſt qualities and eſpecially Heat. But the Influences doe induce both the firſt qualities for example the cold which <hi>Saturn</hi> cauſes, cannot depend upon his Motion nor his Light) and alſo the hidden and occult ones.

Stars were ſaid to be malefick and of an evil diſpoſition; God the Author of them would be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the cauſe of Miſchief, which is full of Impiety. Theſe objections, I ſay, doe not a whit pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice the truth propounded, which may thus be anſwered. All created ſubſtances are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered two waies; either as they are things in being and do concur to the compleating and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Univerſe, and in that reſpect, they are all good: for <hi>to be</hi> and <hi>to be good</hi> are one and the ſame, neither hath the High God bleſſed for ever created any thing which ought to be termed evil, ſimply conſidered. or they are conſidered in regard of their operations, and then they may be termed evil, foraſmuch as they may damnefie ſome other things by reaſon of the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy &amp; inbred Enmity of Nature. And although almoſt innumerable contrarietyes of nature are found in the world, yet muſt they al be termed good in reſpect to God their maker, &amp; in regard of the Univerſ, whoſe perfection conſiſts chiefly in variety. Furthermore the operations of things created, may be termed evil two wayes abſolutely or ſimply conſidered in themſelves, or in reſpect of ſomwhat elſe; They are abſolutely evil when at all times, in all places and upon all occaſions they doe perpetually evil; and in this ſenſe no Creature can be found which is evil; in reſpect of ſome other thing, the operations of things may be termed evil when they hurt one and doe another good; and ſo there is nothing in the whol univerſe ſo hurtful, but that it hath ſome other ways its uſes &amp; benefits, for which it was created: So al poyſons though moſt hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to men or other Animals, yet conveniently uſ'd they doe a great deal of good to them. And in the Art of Phyſick there is ſcarce ſo deadly a poyſon found, but that out of it, by skil of Art, an health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full medicine may be drawn. And finally the actions of Stars upon theſe inferior Bodies are conſidered two waies, either in reſpect of the whol ſublunarie world containing the Elements and al mixed things: and ſo the action of the Heavens and Stars is ſimply benign, ingendering, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveing, vivifieing all things, &amp; doing al other good offices which tend to uphold the univers; &amp; in this ſence moſt true it is, that theſe inferior Bodies are cheriſhed &amp; ſuſteined by the influence of the Heaven and Hevenly Bodies, or they are conſidered in reſpect of the proper nature of this or that Element, or this or that living creature: and then it is no abſurd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

This Comet firſt appeared under the ſign of <hi>Libra</hi> nere the <hi>Aequinoctial Line;</hi> but by a private and peculiar motion of its own, it was carryed from thence, through the feet of <hi>

It was carried with the common motion of the Stars from Eaſt to Weſt, but it ſeemed to be moved ſom what ſwifter than the Stars, for in the firſt Daies of its Apparition, it was wont to riſe a little before five in the morning; and afterwards it roſe about four a Clock and before four, and ſo ſooner and ſooner, till it prevented the Midnight, and Bed-time. And we have reaſon to believe, that this Comet was the Prognoſtick and ſorerunner of malignant and peſtilential Diſeaſes, and alſo of thoſe Wars, wherewith whole Europe in a manner, hath ſince that time been laid Waſt.</p>
                        <p>And although the Air be chief among the mediate Cauſes of malignant and peſtilential Feavers: yet ſure enough other non-natural things do concur to their generation, as I ſhall particularly and berifly declare.</p>
                        <p>The next to air are Aliments, becauſe bad Diet Cauſth a ſickly diſpoſition of the body, which is an internal efficient, and <hi>Cauſaſine qua non,</hi> or malignant and Peſtilential Feavers. Whereupon <hi>Galen</hi> in his Book <hi>De Cibis boni et mali Succi,</hi> and in the 1. <hi>de Differ. Feb. Chap. 3.</hi> Does demonſtrate, that from bad and corrupt Diet Peſtilential Diſeaſes do ariſe. Now meats are ſaid to be evil and the Cauſes of thoſe diſeaſes in many reſpects.</p>
                        <p>And in the firſt place, when the Fruits of the Earth and of Trees, by reaſon of a bad conſtitution of the year <hi>viz.</hi> Over moiſt or over dry, or corrupted by miſts, or ſome tempeſtuous weather, or ſome malignant influence of the ſtars; do, being eaten, produce bad Juices in the body.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, when there is great Famine and ſcarcity of Corn: From whence came that Proverb <hi>Ho loimos meta limon,</hi> the Plague follows famine. For then the poor common People are forced to fill their bellies with ſuch meats as are cheap and bad, whence ariſes abundance of bad Humors. And which is much worſe, when a plenty preſently followes famine, they do then ſuddenly cram themſelves with much meat, which by the languiſhing heat of their internal parts cannot be well digeſted, and thereupon thoſe meats come to participate of a malignant putrefaction.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, VVhen Aliments, which in their own Nature are good do by ſome way or other, gain putrefaction or ſome evil qualitie, ſuch are wheat, barly, beans, and peaſe, and other kind of grain, which being either overlong kept, or ill laid up in a moiſt place, or otherwiſe miſaffected, do come to be muſty, or have ſome other putrefactive qualitie.

                        <p>And finaly, paſſions of the Mind, are wont vehemently to exagitate the body and to diſturb the humors: and ſo they much Diſpoſe the body to receive infection; and eſpecially fear and Sadnes which Drawing the vital Spirits inward, do as it were choak and ſmother them, whereby the vigor of the Heart is ſo broken, that it cannot ſufficienly reſiſt the venom and firſt aſſaults of peſtilential Sickneſſes, yea verily and the Humors being ſtirred in the veines and vehemently diſturbed, are thruſt out of their Natural conſtitution, and do conceive a malignant putrefaction.

                        <p>The Signs which foreſhow a peſtilential Feaver, are taken from three things <hi>viz.</hi> From the the Diſpoſition of the Body, from the Preſence of Cauſes, and from ſome intermediate diſpoſitions.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe bodies are diſpoſed to receive peſtilential Infection, which have collected evil Juyces through bad diet, and by a prepoſterous uſe of the ſix non-natural things aforeſaid. Or ſuch as being ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorick do gorge themſelves and inordinately and unſeaſonably repleniſh themſelves. Furthermore ſome that are neither plethorick nor cacochymical, do diſpoſe their bodies to the reception of this diſeaſe, while they torment their minds with moſt troubleſome paſſions, or give themſelves im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately to carnal embracements; for from theſe two Cauſes, the peſtilential feaver is very or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily produced, foraſmuch as by them corruption is eaſily introduced even am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Finally, thoſe whoſe principal Members are weak, or ſome waies tainted, either from the womb, or by bad diet or any other external Cauſe; which have an hot and moiſt temperature; which have a very thin or very compacted habit of body, are al diſpoſed to peſtilential Feavers, for hot and moiſt bodies are ſubject to putrefaction, thin bodies are liable to al <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                           </gap>; it is eaſily conjectured, that man wil have the Peſttilence: for al there thing do declare, that the humors do attain another nature, and do corrupt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from whence comes a peſtilential Feaver.</p>
                        <p>Such Signs as declare the Peſtilence to be preſent are exactly to be propounded and therefore al the Heads of Signs muſt be run over out of which this Diſeaſe may be known<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which Heads of ſigns, are taken from the three kinds of ſymptomes, becauſe the ſymptomes are the Effects of Diſeaſes, and Cauſes can no way ſo conveniently be known as by their effects. And therefore, ſome ſignes are taken from the Actions hurt, ſome from Excrements voided, and others from qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites changed. Unto which Heads a fourth muſt be added taken from ſupervenient Infirmites. To the right underſtanding of which, theſe things following muſt be premiſed.</p>
                        <p>Friſt, we muſt know that the ſame ſigns in a manner doe ſhew a peſtilental Feaver properly ſo called, and a Feaver ſimply malignant, and that the ſignes of the one and the other doe differ on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly according to more and le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>s; ſo that in the peſtilential Feaver the ſymptoms are more, and in the malignant Feaver leſs cruel; yet there are ſome adjuncts more proper to the one than the other which we ſhall declare in their proper place.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, we muſt note, that there is no true, proper and Pathognomonick ſign of theſe Feavers viz. Such an one as wherever that ſigne is, there is the peſtilence, and where that ſign is not, there is no peſtilence; no not the Bubo or ſwelling in the Groyn nor the Carbuncle; ſeeing that many have them not though they have the plague, and many have Buboes and Carbuncles that have no malignitie in them: neither are thoſe purple ſpots any ſuch pathognomonick ſign, although a malignant Feaver is from them termed the ſpotted Feaver, forasmuch as many have a malignant Feaver without any ſuch ſpots; &amp; thoſe ſpots doe ſometimes appear on women that want, their courſes, and in ſome Children by reaſon of a light ebullition of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>lood, without any Feaver, which I have often ſeen in both. Howbeit by a Concurrency and collection of all ſignes and tokens theſe Feavers may certainly be known,</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, we muſt mark, that al the ſigns which ſhall be propounded, are not found in al ſick perſons of theſe Feavers; but only a part of them, which notwithſtanding will be ſufficient, punctually to diſcover the kind of the diſeaſe. For according to the variety of patients bodies
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:49088:275"/>
&amp; the intention or remiſnes of the diſeaſe, now theſe kind of ſymptomes, &amp; anon thoſe do; chiefly ſhew themſelves.</p>
                        <p>Finally, it muſt be known, that the ſigns of a peſtilential and malignant Feaver (although they are alſo found in other Feavers) yet are made in ſome ſort pathognomonick in this Feaver in a two-fold reſpect. Firſt, becauſe in theſe Feavers, they are ſo conditioned as in other Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers they are not. For the Head-ach, Ilneſs at Stomach, Vomiting, the manner of the Heat and other ſigns, when they accompanie peſtilential Feavers, they have a peculiar malignant condition whereby they differ from themſelves when they accompanie other ordinarie Feavers; which is wel known to them that are but indifferently exerciſed in the Practice of Phyſick. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe the ſymptomes do not obſerve the ſame proportion among themſelves in theſe Feavers, which they doe in ordinarie ones. So that the heat being gentle to the touch, the pulſe not much changed, doe ſhew a ſmal Feaver: yet with them is joyned mighty Head-ach, wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings and ſomtimes raveings, and other ſymptoms which are wont to accompanie a burning Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Theſe things being thus premiſed, we ſhal decribe the order of ſigns, beginning from the actions hindered.</p>
                        <p>Becauſe therefore, the Heart is cheifly afflicted in theſe diſeaſes, by the malignant and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous quality thereof, therefore its action viz. The Pulſe, is diverſly changed, according to the varietie of times and the divers condition of the diſeaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                           <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For ſomtimes at the firſt, it is in a manner natural, and very like the pulſe of perſons in health, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſhews in the 3 de preſag. cap. 4. but in the progreſs and augmentation of the diſeaſe, it is little, weak and unequall. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the frequentneſs of the pulſe is alwayes more than the increaſ of heat can require, becauſe the Heart being provoked by the malignant qualitie, doth in that regard diſturb it ſelf more than the neceſſity of eventilation doth require. Likewiſe the ſigns of this Feaver are.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Cardialgia,</hi> Heart burning or pain of the mouth of the ſtomach, which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> condemns as a ſign of malignity 1. Progn. in theſe words, Pam of the mouth of the ſtomach, with diſtention of the Hypochondria and Head-ach, are ſigns of malignity.</p>
                        <p>Somtimes great thirſt, exceeding the meaſure of the Patients heat and ſomtimes want of thirſt, with a vehement Feaver, and dryneſs of the Tongue, for both are ſigns of maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</p>
                        <p>Great want of appetite which make many abhor al kinds of meat, as much as if they were the moſt loathſom medicines. Now this is wont to ariſe from malignant vapors which vex the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.</p>
                        <p>Stomach Sickneſs and vomiting ariſing from the ſame Cauſe, eſpecially when it happens in the beginning of the diſeaſe, and is ſo divers that ſome preſently vomit what they eat; other vomits as ſoon as they have taken broath, but they vomit not the broath which they took, but divers kinds of Humors; ſome keep any kind of meat, but vomit their Drinks, Iuleps, Emulſions and whatever drinking matter is given them, preſently; great thirſt notwithſtanding remaining, with dryneſs and blacknes of the tongue.</p>
                        <p>A frequent and inordinate ſhivering, which comes divers times in a day, ſpringing from ſharp and biting exhalations of an adverſe qualitie to our natures, which are carried unto the ſenſitive parts: which kind of ſhivering does rarely happen in other putred Feavers, becauſe the vapors in them have not the like malignitie. In malignant intermitting tertians, ſomtimes a ſign of malignitie is taken from the ſhaking and the cold. For it ſomtimes happens, that in the beginning of the fit, with a light coldneſs or ſhivering, the heat doth ſo much retire inwards, that the fleſh of the patient is very cold and the face is like that of a dead perſon, and the pulſe ſo little as if it did not beat at al. After which follows an Heat, which neither in the Augment nor in the ſtate, doth to the touch feel great or ſharp; yea and the fleſh of the patient is either lukewarm to feel to, or coldiſh even to the decl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>nation. The pulſe, when the heat comes, doth more appear, yet it is ſmall, unequal, frequent and very weak: and many other ſymptomes of a peſtilential Feaver are preſent, which may ſufficiently prove, that there are intermitting malignant Feavers as well as continual; as was hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before.</p>
                        <p>Wearyneſs of the whol bodie, Heavineſs, and a breaking as it were of the members appear in the beginning of the diſeaſe, by reaſon of the foreſaid vapors, diſperſed through the whol Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</p>
                        <p>Paines of the Head, Watchings and Raveings, which al come from the ſame cauſes, viz. from ſharp and venemous vapors; which when they lodg themſelves in the membranes of the Brain, they cauſe head-ach and in as much as they heat and dry the very ſubſtance of the brain, if the alteration be but ſmall, they cauſe watchings, if great they cauſe ravings. And to theſe ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes, beſides Heat and Dryneſs, the venemous quality contributes much, becauſe in the vulgar Feavers ſuch ſymptoms do not happen, unleſs the diſtemper be much more than ordinarie. And paines in this Feaver, have a peculiar property to be very diverſe, &amp; to ſhift places. For ſomtimes only

                        <p>In ſome patients drouſie and ſleepie diſpoſitions happen, viz. In ſuch as have their brains ful of flegmatick excrements: which flegmatick excrements, are deſolved by hot vapors aſcending from the inferior parts, and doe hinder the functions of the Brain.</p>
                        <p>The urin in theſe peſtilential Feavers, is ſometimes like the urin of ſound perſons, namely when the humors doe more offend through a malignant Qualitie, than by putrefaction; &amp; ſomtimes it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues ſo for the firſt days; afterwards it becomes thick &amp; troubled. Somtimes in the ſtate of the diſeaſe, it appears concoct, though the ſick are in a periſhing condition. ſometimes, it is thin and crude, haveing no ſediment, or ſuch a ſediment as is more like an excrement than a ſediment. But moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly it appears thick and troubled, and of an high colour; and hath a thick, red, diſtrubed and ſcattered ſediment. And finaly al evil diſpoſitions of urines, doe happen in this diſeaſe, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the divers alterations of the putreſieing and corrupted Humors.</p>
                        <p>Chollerick fluxes of the belly, which either comes of themſelves or through ſome like occaſions by ſome gentle Clyſter or medicament; which bring many to their end, So <hi>Hippocrates</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates in 3. Epidem. In a peſtilential Conſtitution there deſcribed, that many died of the looſneſs and Bloody-flux: For the Humors being made more furious by the malignant qualitie which is in them, doe exceedingly provoke Nature, ſo that ſhe indeavors to drive them out the neereſt way: Now in theſe Stooles, there is wont to be a mighty ſtink, by reaſon of the extream cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the humors.</p>
                        <p>An abundance of Worms is wont to be avoided in this diſeaſe, eſpecially at the beginning: For the great Putrefaction doth very much diſpoſe the Humors to breed Worms.</p>
                        <p>Frequent ſweates, ſmall, ſhort and unprofitable doe break forth in the beginning of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.</p>
                        <p>The Heat is mild and gentle to feel to, ſo that they ſearſe ſeem to have a Feaver, whereupon <hi>Galen 9. Simp. cap. de Bolo Armen, &amp; Avic. fen 4. lib. 1. cap de febre peſtilenti.</hi> Doe teach that peſtilential Feavers have of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>times a mild and gentle Heat; and the reaſon is, becauſe theſe diſeaſes are rather cauſed by a malignant and venemous quality, than of an ordinarie diſtemper and Pucrefaction.</p>
                        <p>Readneſs of the eyes isoften ſeen in peſtilential Feavers, becauſe the membranes of the Brain are in a ſort inflamed by ſharp vapors aſcending into the head, which they eaſily commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to the <hi>Tunica adnata</hi> or ſkin of the eyes ſo called, which is propagated from the ſaid mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes</p>
                        <p>Finally, purple ſpots like Flea-bitings, called by later Phyſitians <hi>Peticulos</hi> or <hi>Petechiae,</hi> are the proper and peculiar Signs of a malignant Feaver. For they are found in no other kind of Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; foraſmuch as they do ariſe from a vitious quality of the blood or other humors, joyned with malignity. Yet there do appear in other diſeaſes, ſpots very like unto thoſe aforeſaid, but ſpringing from a far different Cauſe; <hi>viz.</hi> From the over thinnes of the blood, which being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agitated by the heat or the expulſive faculty, does ſprout forth of the Capillary Veins into the Skin. Theſe ſpots, are wont for the moſt part to appear in ſuch as have ſome flux of blood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the blood in ſuch is more thin and watry: and alſo in ſplenetick perſons, in ſuch as have the Jaundiſe and old obſtructions of the Bowels, and (in a word) in al ſuch, who by reaſon of the weaknes of their Bowels, do breed watry blood and are apt to fal into a Cachexy. For in ſuch perſons, the blood being made thinner than ordinary, ſometimes flows out at the Noſe, ſomtimes at ſome other part, and ſomtimes it comes out of the Capillary Veins into the Skin; where being retained, it loſethits own coluor, and becomes either blewiſh, or black, or light red, and cauſes great variety of ſpots; which notwithſtanding are very far dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the ſpots of peſtilential feavers, and do argue nothing but the watry thinneſs of the blood and weakneſs of the Liver. Now thoſe ſpots which come out, in Peſtilential feavers, do ariſe from Humors putrefiing and infected with an evil quality. Furthermore, thoſe ſpots do break out ſomtimes critically and ſomtimes Symptomatically. Critically, when as Nature haveing either in Part or in whol overcome the putrefaction and corrected the bad quality, does drive the corrupt humor to the external parts; And then the diſeaſe is evermore abated. Symptomatically when Nature is pricked forward by the quantity or evil quality of the morbifick matter, does tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a portion thereof unto the Skin, before it be concocted, or the evil quality thereof amended. And from thence the Patient receives no Eaſe, but rather, Nature haveing unprofitably wraſtled with the diſeaſe, it is a token rather that ſhee is conquered than conquers.</p>
                        <p>The Colours of theſe ſpots are divers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and do ſhow the Diverſity of the humors by which they are bred. For the red ſpots are bred of the purer ſort of blood, and the black from chollerick blood more or leſs aduſt. As for the ſtore of theſe ſpots, ſomtime they appear in greater numbers and
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:49088:276"/>
ſomtimes in leſs. They begin to appear ſomtimes on the fourth, fifth, ſeventh, or ninth, or ſome other critical day, if their coming out portend any good; ſomtimes on other daies, when there is little good to be hoped for thereby. Somtimes they are ſeen in al parts of the body, but moſt frequently in the Loynes, breſt and Neck.</p>
                        <p>Now the Diſeaſes which come, upon a peſtilential feaver for the moſt part are, ſomthing coming out like Pox called <hi>Exanthemata;</hi> Puſhes and Ulcers of the Mouth; Carbuncles; Riſings in the Groyn and behind the Ears.</p>
                        <p>The Exanthemata aforeſaid, differ from the purple ſpots, becauſe in the ſpots there is only the color changed, but here is a certain riſing in theſe <hi>Exanthemata</hi> to an head. Somtimes they are like warts, and ſomtimes leſs, reſembling millet ſeed. Somtimes they are red, being cauſed by blood ſomtimes white, proceeding of flegm or Seroſities; yellow from choller; purple from aduſt Choller; blewiſh or black, by reaſon of great burning or Mortification. Some break out Symptomatically, others Critically, others in a middle way. Some dry away, others come to matter, others grow to be ulcerous.</p>
                        <p>To theſe may be referred puſhes appearing in the Mouth which have al the differences of the forſaid <hi>Exanthemata,</hi> and are ſomtimes ſo malignant, that the ſick can hardly endure to eat and drink. From Children they often Cauſe Death becauſe they wil not endure the pain of eating and drinking. Theſe puſhes do ſomtimes degenerate into Ulcers, which breed very great trouble to the patients, hindering the motion of their tongue and eſpecially their ſwallowing.</p>
                        <p>But ſomtimes Ulcers are bred in the Mouth immediately without any puſtules or puſhes foregoing which the <hi>Greeks</hi> cal <hi>Aphthe:</hi> of which there are many ſorts. For ſome are ſuperficial, others profound; ſome clean, others foul; ſome benign, others malignant; ſome with a Cruſt, others without. And the Cruſt is ſomtimes white, ſomtimes yellow, ſomtimes blewiſh or black. Thoſe which are deep, filthy and malignant and that have a black Cruſt, are the moſt dangerous.</p>
                        <p>Carbuncles and Buboes, are wont to riſe in divers parts of the body, but eſpecialy where the Glandules are; becauſe the expulſive faculty being provoked by a malignant quality does expel the pernicious matter from the internal parts eſpecially the more noble ones to the external: ſo that from the Brain ſhee ſends it to the Glandules or kernels behind the Ears; from the Heart, to the Arm-pits; from the Liver to the Groyns; whence ſwellings under the Ears called <hi>Parotides,</hi> &amp; thoſe in the Groyn called <hi>Bubones,</hi> do ariſe. Which kinds of tumors do cheifly appear in a true peſtilential feaver, eſpecially thoſe in the Groyn, which therefore the common people call the Peſt or Plague. But Carbuncles and <hi>Parotides</hi> orriſings behind the Ears, do alſo break out in malignant Feavers, but in ſuch as are at the top of malignity, and come very neer the Nature of true Peſtilential Feavers.</p>
                        <p>Signs commemorative, are chiefly in requeſt when Phyſitians are called to view the Corps of the dead, at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>uch times as there is a Plague abroad, or ſome ſuſpition thereof, that it may be known whether the party died of the plague or not.</p>
                        <p>And firſt of al, in ſuch dead bodies there do ſomtimes appear thoſe ſpots of which we ſpake before and ſomtimes marks, or ſtripes, as it were after whipping: for theſe are the tokens of a Peſtilential diſeaſe and venemous, ſeeing thoſe that are poyſoned have alſo theſe ſigns. And thoſe ſpots do eſpecially denote the Peſtilence, when they are of a lead Color or black. Alſo thoſe <hi>Exanthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata</hi> ſpoken of before, do ſhew the ſame, eſpecially if they have a bad Color: but much more the Buboes, <hi>Tarotides</hi> and Carbuncles whereunto may be added ſuch ſigns as have appeared in the Courſe of the diſeaſe: for the recounting of them wil make a certain demonſtration.</p>
                        <p>The Prognoſtick of Peſtilential Feavers is ſo uncertain, that nothing can be certainly affirmed touching their Event, until certain tokens appear either that Nature or the diſeaſe hath gotten victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; which is not wont to happen, unleſs about the end of the ſtate or the Beginning of the Decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Where the diſcreet Phyſitian ought to delay and ſuſpend his Judgment touching the Iſſue of the diſeaſe in the Beginning and the Augment</p>
                        <p>Wee muſt nevertheleſs propound the chief tokens out of which we may draw a great Conjecture, whether the diſeaſe wil end in Death or Health, by help whereof we may foreſee, what is to be hoped or feared. yet not being over confident: for Experience hath taught us, that many have eſcaped, with moſt mortal ſigns; and others have periſhed under al the tokens of Recovery. But we ſhal paſs over al ſuch prognoſtick ſigns which are common to al acute diſeaſes, of which <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> hath diſcourſed largely in his Prognoſticks, Coick, Predictions, Procheticks, and Epidemicks and likewiſe in his Aphoriſms, which may have a place likewiſe in this diſeaſe. But wee wil propound only ſuch as are proper in a ſpecial manner to peſtilential Feavers, from which a more certain Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction may be drawn.</p>
                        <p>Now theſe may be drawn from the ſame fountains from whence wee drew the Diagnoſticks.</p>
                        <p>Firſt Therefore, in theſe Feavers, if the pulſe keep a tenor and equality, be the Feaver never ſo great, it gives alwaies ſome matter of hopes. Contrarily an inordinate, unequal and contracted pulſe, is dangerous, eſpecially if it appear weak from the Beginning. But thoſe differences of
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:49088:277"/>
pulſes are not ſo dangerous in malignant Feavers, as in ordinary ones. For although an intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting pulſe in a young man, be ſo deadly a ſign, that <hi>Galen</hi> teſtifies, though he had ſeen many old folks and children eſcape having an intermitting pulſe divers daies and yet eſcaped. Pulſes like thoſe of perſons in Health are very dangerous: for they ſignifie that Nature out of weakneſs abſtains from the Concoction of Humors. For where by an evil and pernicious quality, the ſtrength is exceedingly weakened, Nature being weak, does not ſet her ſelf to digeſt the matter, not meedling with the Humor which hath cauſed the diſeaſe: ſo that no endeavor of coction being uſed, no labor follows, and there is either no Feaver, or a very little one. Wee have an example hereof in external tumors, in which ſo long as the Part is almoſt overwhelmed by the plenty or il condition of the matter, there is neither Pain nor Terror; but whereas Nature begins to fight againſt the matter and to turn it into quittor then the feaver is much increaſed. Even ſo in malignant ſeavers, the Patients ſeem ſomtimes freed from their feaver, whereas they grow worſe and draw towards death: as we may ſee in <hi>Hippocrates</hi> 3. Epidem. Secti. Aegr. 2. where <hi>Hermocrates</hi> from the twentieth day to the twenty fourth ſeemed to have no Feaver, and yet on the twenty ſixth he died.</p>
                        <p>Raving is very common in this Feaver. neither is it to be feared, if it be leſſened by ſleep, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if it vaniſh away with a plentyful ſweat: for tis a ſign that the matter is drawn from the Brain, into the habit of the Body. But a perſevering dotage, is pernicious, becauſe it's a token that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generates into a true Phrenzy.</p>
                        <p>The contractions and hoppings of the Members, which do often happen in this Feaver, are Convuſive motions and very pernicious, and that the more if joyned with raveing, for they ſignifie the brain to be extreamely hurt</p>
                        <p>Trembling motions of the hands and Tongue are wont to be deadly and are by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> much condemned in the 1. Prognoſt. For they ſhew great weakeneſs, and that Nature is overcome by the diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>Deafnes though in the beginnings of occult diſeaſes it be exceeding dangerous, according to the Doctrine of <hi>Hippocrates;</hi> yet if it appear in the State of a diſeaſe it portends health, eſpecially in malignant Feavers. And I have obſerved a thouſand times, that ſuch as being ſick of Peſtilential Feavers, were taken Deaf in the State of the diſeaſe, did al eſcape, though the other ſymptomes were never ſo dangerous; for it is a token that the brain, being ſufficiently ſtrong does thruſt the humors from the internal to the external parts.</p>
                        <p>Sneezing, according to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> even in deadly diſeaſes (provided the Lungs be in good Caſe) do give Hope of recovery. But in malignant Feavers, be the ſymptomes otherwiſe never ſo dangerous, they promiſe Recovery.</p>
                        <p>Frequent Heart-burnings or Hiccoughings, do portend danger, and ſignifie that the ſtomach is grievouſly afflicted by the venemous quality.</p>
                        <p>Extream averſneſs to meat, is very dangerous for it ſignifies the Stomach to be maſtered by the malignant quality of the Humor, and that its temper is wholly overthrown, ſo that it refuſeth and abominates laudable nouriſhment, which it moſt familiarly affecteth in time of Health.</p>
                        <p>Suppreſſion of al evacuations in the beginning and augment of the Diſeaſe, is counted a good ſign. For it ſhews that the morbiſick matter is not ſo malignant, as to provoke Nature to excretion before the due time but that Nature does yet conquer, and wil in due time expell the matter, provided there be no ſign that the Humor wil ſettle in the Head, Belly or any principal part. But in the ſtate of the diſeaſe for nothing to be evacuated, but for worſer ſigns to appear in ſome principal mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; is bad. For it's a ſign the diſeaſe wil either laſt long, or give little hope of Life. For the matter which in divers daies could not be overcome, does bring ſome great dammage in the ſame member, as a phrenzy, Lethargy, and others which ariſe after the eleventh of fourteenth day, which can very hardly be cured by al the Medicines imaginable.</p>
                        <p>Blood that is drawn by Phlebotomie, if it appear no waies faulty, but pure and according to Nature, tis a dangerous token. For it is a plain argument that there is more of a venemous qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, than of putrefaction; or that putrefaction may lurk in the Veins next the Heart, which cannot be drawn away by Phlebotomy.</p>
                        <p>From Urines in a Peſtilential Feaver, there is ſcarce any, or a very uncertain prediction to be made. For not only the confuſed, troubled, thinner, and thicker Urine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are bad, as in other Feavers: But alſo that Urine which is like the Urine of a healthy Perſon. Yea verily, and many have died, after the Urines have ſhewed ſigns of Concoction, and then became crude again.</p>
                        <p>Howbeit, Concocted Urines, and which have a laudable <hi>Enaeorema</hi> continuing many daies; and daily more uniting it ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and deſcending by little and little into the bottom of the Urinal, doth perpetualy promiſe certain recovery, even in malignant Feavers. For it cannot be, that a luſty and ſtrong natural Faculty, which diſcovers it ſelf plainly in theſe Urines, ſhould not riſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>s againſt the malignant Quality, and at length overcome the ſame. And therefore I have oftentimes with great confidence foretold a good event from the ſigns of Concoction perſevering in the Urines
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:49088:277"/>
in ſuch as have had malignant Feavers, attended with moſt grievous Symptoms, ſo that all the By-ſtanders were in great fear of their Lives.</p>
                        <p>A Fat and oyly Urine, black or livid, with a black or blewiſh ſettling, doth certainly betoken death.</p>
                        <p>Very much Urine being made, and no abatement of the Feaver thereupon is dangerous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſignifies a melting of the Body.</p>
                        <p>Sweats in this Feaver, although they come well conditioned, and in the Critical day, doth ſeldom perfectly judge the Diſeaſe. And ſomtimes the Feaver is abated by Sweat on the firſt day; and then the Symptoms grow high, and after many Sweats the Patient dies. For plentiful Sweats, not diminiſhing the Diſeaſe, doth ariſe from the melting of the whol Body. Neither muſt we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beleeve, that Critical Sweats doth never any good in theſe Feavers. For by how much leſs Venom there is in the Diſeaſe, they do ſo much the more good; as it happens in ordinary Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. And we find by Obſervation, that 'tis far the better for the Patients to Sweat often at the beginning of the Diſeaſe (provided they be not worſe after their Sweats) for 'tis a ſign that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth attenuate the Matter by little and little, and expel the ſame by Sweat.</p>
                        <p>Looſneſs of the Belly is a very uncertain ſign. For oftentimes a Looſneſs at the beginning of the Diſeaſe hath been good, which yet experience ſhews, is ſomtimes a deadly token. Again af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome Coction, we have ſeen the Patient killed, by a looſneſs, and ſomtimes by the ſame reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered: Yet we muſt thus diſtinguiſh. When a venemous Quality hath the maſtery, the more the Matter goes away by Stool at the beginning of the Diſeaſe, the leſs danger. But when the Diſeaſe ariſes moſt part from putrefaction of the Humors, they are worſe that are looſe, at the beginning of the Diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>Purple ſpots<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when they are many and large, and of a benign color, and break out Critical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they foretel that Nature wil Conquer. But if they be few, ſmal, &amp; of a bad color, and are Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomatically put forth, they ſignifie that Nature is never worſted. And further, If they go in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, its the worſt ſign of all; for it ſhews that the morbific Matters reflux into the inward parts.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Exanthemata,</hi> or wheels appearing in divers parts of the Body, are effects of greater malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity than Purple Spots, and conſequently portend greater danger.</p>
                        <p>Carbuncles and Buboes, or riſings in the Groin and ſome other parts, doth witneſs greateſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity, and threaten moſt danger: ſeeing they are wont to follow thoſe Feavers whoſe peculiar Character it is, that more die of them than recover.</p>
                        <p>Carbuncles &amp; Buboes, by how much they are the further from the Heart, grow faſter and come quicker to ripen, by ſo much the leſs dangerous are they. But if Tumors encreaſe ſuddenly with bad Symptoms, 'tis ill. Carbuncles very great, of a filthy color, with an eating Ulcer, or which turn into a Grangrene, are deadly: as alſo thoſe which are neer the Heart, or riſe upon the Throat Experience hath taught that many Carbuncles are more dangerous than few; and contrarily many Buboes or other riſings are more ſafe, than few. <hi>Perotides</hi> (or riſings behind the Ears) in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant and Purple Feavers, are in the Augment and ſtate deadly. But if they appear when the Diſeaſe doth never ſo little decline and come to Suppuration, they are a good token.</p>
                        <p>The Cure of a Peſtilential Feaver is divided into two parts. The firſt contains the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of thoſe that have it not; the ſecond contains the healing of thoſe that have it.</p>
                        <p>The preſervation from the Peſt conſiſts chiefly in taking away of thoſe Cauſes, which make Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies fit to receive the Peſtilence, and breed it in them. And they are Internal or External; the Internal are a Diſpoſition of the Body apt thereto, a Plethorie, a Cachochimy, and Obſtructions. The External are eſpecially, a vitiated Air, and a wandring Contagion. Bodies diſpoſed to this Diſeaſe, are ſuch as either Naturally or Accidently, are more moiſt than they ought to be; Weak lax and rare, denſe and compact. Moiſt bodies muſt be dryed; drie muſt be preſerved in that temper; the former muſt avoid full diet, much drinking and all moiſt nouriſhments; ſuch as are eſpecially Fruits that wil not keep, Hearbs, Fiſhes, Meats made of milk; the South air, ſuch as comes from lakes, and eſpecially the air of the night, Idlenes, long Sleep, eſpecially Sleeping after dinners, Batheings and whatever elſe can moiſten the Body.</p>
                        <p>Let weak bodies be ſtrengthened, with a reſtorative diet and with ſtrengthening me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments. Thoſe of a rare lax and thin conſtitution, need the ſame waies of prevention with the moiſt.

                        <p>A Plethory requires Phlebotimy provided nothing do adviſe the contrary, as a very cold or hot ſeaſon of the year, and a peſtilential Conſtitution of the Ayr in which a vein muſt not be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

unleſs a <hi>Plethora ad vaſa</hi> do manifeſtly urge the ſame; or ſome uſual evacuations of blood by courſes, hemorrhoids, or noſe-bleeding, have been ſtopped. For the blood being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſt the air which is breathed in will more eaſily imprint it's peſtilential qualitie, and in caſe the diſeaſe happen, the Patient will the hardlier eſcape, for being weakened by blood-leting even as they who drink poiſon after blood letting, it penetrates the more and they are with more difficulty recovered. Alſo when we fear poyſon, we let not the patient blood, ſo <hi>Galen Lib. 7. de diff. Feb. Cap.</hi> 4. Where he propoundes a preſervation from a peſtilential Feaver, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes indeed Purgation and opening of obſtructions; but he makes no mention of Phleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</p>
                        <p>To Cacochymy we muſt oppoſe purgeing, ſuch as is proper for the bumors offending, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient preparation being premiſed if it ſeem neceſſary: with this caution, that benign medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be only uſed, abſtaining from ſuch as have a malignant and deadly qualitie. with which it will be good to mix ſome Bezoarticks and ſuch things as are Alexipharmical.</p>
                        <p>Obſtructions are cauſed by the multitude of humors their thickneſs and clammineſs. The multitude will be helped by ſuch urin as evacuates the thickneſs; by ſuch as attenuate the cla m<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineſs by things that are abſterſive or clenſing.</p>
                        <p>In reſpect of externall cauſes, Precaution muſt be made firſt by correcting the exceſſes of the air viz. By cooling that which is too hot, as we taught in continual Feavers; by drying that which is over moiſt, with ſires both in ſtreets &amp; in private houſes, and that as much as may be made with ſweet woods as Juniper, Bayes, Roſemary and ſuch like. Secondly by removing al the cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es above recited which do infect the air. Thirdly by conſuming and diſſipating the infections in the air. which may be don by kindeling of fires, as was ſaid in correcting the moiſture of the air, and the perfumes of ſweet ſmelling and Alexipharmical materials. Alſo by vehement agitation of the ayr, to which end the frequent diſcharging of great Guns will be very ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall.</p>
                        <p>But if the ayr ſhal be very much infected, ſo as therefrom a Feaver truly peſtilential ſhal ariſe, the beſt kind of preſervative is to change the air, and they that are forced to continue, or to converſe in places infected and among the ſick: have need of many other cautions and they muſt often uſe Antidotes. All which are at large ſet down by ſuch Authors as have treated expreſly of the Plague, and from thence the reader muſt fetch them; becauſe my deſign is but briefly to touch ſuch things as are requiſite to the cure of the true peſtilence; becauſe few Phyſitians of any note dare hazard themſelves in the cure of the true Plague: &amp; contrarily ſeeing both in <hi>England</hi> &amp; in <hi>France</hi> and whol Europe over; al Phyſitians in a manner have imployed themſelves in the cure of ſpotted and malignant Feavers; I have thought it moſt worth my paines to direct this cure to that kind of peſtilential Feaver, which is ſimplie called malignant and the ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or purple Feaver. Yet ſo that it may ſerve for the cure of the true Plague; ſeeing as we ſaid at the beginning, the ſame Medicines and the ſame Indications, will ſerve for both.</p>
                        <p>The Cure therefore of thoſe which are actualy ſick muſt be directed unto the Feaver, the putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and the malignant qualitie. The Feavers muſt be oppoſed with Coolers and Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteners, the Putrefaction with Evacuators and Alterers. The malignant qualitie with Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes. Al which intentions muſt be ſatiſfied by a threefold Medicinal Meanes after the manner following.</p>
                        <p>The ſame diet muſt be appointed in this Feaver which was appointed in the continual Feavers. Only this one thing muſt be obſerved, that ſharp things muſt be oftener uſed in drinks and broaths as being very fit to reſiſt putrefaction and the malignant quality. Alſo touching drink this muſt be obſerved that the uſe of wine and ſtrong drink is ſomtimes good in this Feaver, becauſe they and eſpecially wine are very cordial and contrary to the malignant quality. Yet many times they do much hurt and encreaſe the heat of the Feaver. Wherefore the prudence of a phyſitian, is in this caſe very neceſſary, that he may contemplate the Nature of the diſeaſe and conſtitution of the patient: for by this meanes he ſhal know whether the uſe of wine or ſtrong drink be ſafe or no For if the Feaver be very ſmal, but the venemous quality very intenſe, and the body of the patient abound with flegm, wine wel allaied with water may be ſafely given and to good purpoſe. But on the other ſide in an high Feaver and a chollerick conſtitution, to give wine or ſtrong drink is pernicious. This I have learned by a mutlitude of Experiments and eſpecially in the yeer 1623. When the Purple Feaver was rife at <hi>Montpelier</hi> after the City had bin beſeidged. Which Feaver was ſo malignant, that a third part at leaſt of thoſe which had it died, and it differed from the true Plague only in the point of a Bubo: foraſmuch as not only whelkes and <hi>Exanthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata,</hi> red, blewiſh and black, but alſo Carbuncles and ſwellings behind the eares did often appear. For to ſuch Sick perſons whoſe pulſe was not very quick and like the pulſe of a ſound perſon, their
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:49088:278"/>
Tongue moiſt and they without thirſt, I gave wine with good ſucceſs; and I was enclined to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the uſe thereof, by reaſon of the good the patients found thereby, and becauſe by the uſe thereof the Feaver was not at al augmented, neither did any thirſt or drynes of the tongue ariſe thereby. But in ſuch whoſe Feaver was more ſtrong, with thirſt, dryneſs roughneſs or blackneſs of Tongue, I wholly forbad wine, and kept them perpetually to the uſe of cooling and tart drinkes. But it is to be remembred, that in the firſt daies of the diſeaſe wine muſt never be given, leaſt the crude matter be too much agitared, but only about the ſtate, when the ſigns of malignity do begin more and more to ſhew themſelves. Howbeit <hi>Zacutus Luſitanus</hi> in the 93. Obſ. Lib. 1. of his wonderful Cures and Caſes, relates that in a peſtilential Feaver, the patient being extream thirſty, with a dry and black tongue and paſt hope, he gave wine with moſt happy ſucceſs, ſo that the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient was cured there with alone. But here that ſaying of <hi>Cornelius Celſus</hi> is to the purpoſe, Thoſe which <hi>Reaſon</hi> could not, have many times bin cured with <hi>Raſhneſs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Diet being ordered, the cure muſt be begun by blood-letting, a Clyſter being premiſed: for bleeding is very convenient, both in regard of the Greatnes of the diſeaſe, the hot diſtemper and the putrefaction. But in defining the quantity of blood which is to be taken away, prudence is neceſſary, when in regard of the malignant quality, it does no good but hurt; for thereby the vital faculty is exceedingly weakened, and thoſe which are let blood after being poyſoned, are haſtned to their death. Therefore if a malignant and venemous quality be more than the putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, which may eaſily be known by the proper ſigns a foreſaid, little blood muſt be taken away but if putrefaction be more conſiderable than the venemous quality, blood muſt be taken in a greater quantity. And conſequently, if by reaſon of a ſickly Conſtitution of body, and of putrid humors contained in the veins, the malignant Feaver have bin produced chiefly; blood-letting may ſafely be repeated, once, twice or thrice until the Burthen of vitious humors contained in the veins be diſcharged. And that eſpecially if Inflamation of any of the Bowels be feared, which many times happens in malignant Feavers. Now bleeding muſt be uſed betimes and at the beginning of the diſeaſe for if the diſeaſe ſhall have taken progreſs and the malignity be diffuſed into the whol Maſs of blood; bleeding does not only no good, but very much weakens Nature; ſo that very many Authors hold, that blood muſt not be let after the fourth day is paſt. And truly, foraſmuch as malignant Feavers do at ſeveral times differ much one from another, in regard of the different degree of Malignity; when they begin to be rife once, diligent obſervation muſt be made, what good the Patients receive by bloodletting. For ſome Feavers being of the kind of Synochi, in which there is great putrefaction and little malignity, are much leſſened by Phlebotomy. And others whoſe Nature conſiſts very near wholly in malignity do become more pernicious by blood letting. This appeares in the true Peſt, in which by the experiment of many approved Authors, it is aſſured, that al which were let blood died So <hi>Wierus</hi> relates in an Epidemical Catarrh which wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred al Europe over in the yeare 1580. in which al in a manner recovered, ſo that ſcarce one of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand died; yet al that were let blood died thereof. Now we muſt diligently obſerve that which <hi>Galen</hi> hath taught us in the 14. Method chap. 10. that in the Cure of Carbuncles it is good to take blood til the Patient faint away, that the boiling blood which cauſes the Carbuncle may be plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully evacuated. Whenas the ſame <hi>Galen, Lib. de Curat. per venae, S.</hi> Cap. 14. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands that in Phlegmonous tumors blood be taken away, till the Color Change, unleſs the Patient be weak, or the Phlegmone malignant. Whereby is intimated, that <hi>Galen</hi> admits copious blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letting in a ſimple Carbuncle that is void of malignity but not in a malignant and Peſtilent one; which agrees to an hair with the former Precept propounded by us.</p>
                        <p>As concerning the times and intervalls of blood-letting wherein it is to be iterated, this is to be noted: that if the diſeaſe proceed ſlowly, the blood-lettings muſt not be haſtened: for the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients ſtrength is too ſoon weakened; ſo that it cannot hold out, til al the morbiſick matter be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled. According therefore as the diſeaſe is moved; ſo the Phyſitian ought ſooner or later to let the Patient blood.</p>
                        <p>And there is a great Controverſie, whether Purple ſpots or wheales appear; Phlebotomy is to be uſed. For ſome account it to be an hamous Crime to let blood when the <hi>Exanthemaia</hi> appear, becauſe at that time the humors are moved from the Centre to the Circumference, which motion muſt be by al meanes furthered; and by blood-letting the humors are put into a clean contrary motion, and the blood is drawn from the Circumference to the Centre, when as the inner parts being emptied, it muſt needs be that the blood contained in the outward parts, ſhould run inwards again; which <hi>Galen</hi> plainly teacheth in his 9 <hi>Deſanit. Tuend. Cap. 10. viz.</hi> That the Blood when a vein is opened, does flow back from the whol bulk of the body into the internal parts. And the ſame <hi>Galen</hi> in his Comment upon the 9 <hi>Epidem.</hi> Does conjecture that <hi>Simon.</hi> of whom <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſpake haveing broad puſhes came out, had no good from his vomit, becauſe ſuch juyces were thereby to be evacuated, which took their Courſe to the Skin. Howbeit, by the more ſound Advice of Doctors it's concluded, that the Purple ſpots appearing in the beginning of the diſeaſe and on thoſe
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:49088:279"/>
dayes in which a vein is wont to be opened, if blood were not ſufficienly taken away before, it muſt even then be drawn in immoderate quantity; Nether is there any danger to be feared by ſo doing; ſeeing that ſame Eruption of wheals, which comes in the beginning of the diſeaſe, is not critical but Symptomatical only, ariſing from an exceeding ebullition of blood, and from the fervency of malignant and putrefying Humors; and therefore the Motion of Nature cannot be hindered, when there is more to hinder. For in Caſe the Pacients body being Plethorick, the Urme thick and red, you ſhal not let blood becauſe of the <hi>Exanthemata</hi> or wheales breaking forth; Nature wil ſcarce be able to Maſter ſuch a quantity of Humors, and it is to be feared leaſt they ſhould ruſh into ſome internal part of the body and breed therein a pernicious inflamation. Howbeit, blood at ſuch a time muſt be ſparingly taken away, not ſo as the veines may be emptyed, which might cauſe a retraction of the evil humors inward again but only ſo as to take away their over great abundance, which being taken away, the veines draw no new blood, but only fal a little together as it were and become a litle looſened ſo as to purſe themſelves the better, and conſequently to be the better able to rule the remaining blood. And ſo is the motion and expulſion of Nature furthered which ſhe endeavours towards the Surface of the body, for ſhe being eaſed of part of her load wherewith ſhe was oppreſſed, does more eaſily caſt off the remainder, and drive the ſame out. Which we doe every where behold in our practice, whiles the very ſame day oftentimes, in which a vein is opened, yea verily ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a few hours after, pleantiful ſweats, critical and healthy doe break forth. And in truth, though nature were ſo ſtrong that ſhe could ſufficiently rule al the redundant blood, ſeeing that in plet horick bodies the blood is wont to be thick and by theſe eruptions into the Skin, the thinner part of the blood only is evacuated, and the thicker abiding in the veines does more and more putrefie, and makes the diſeaſe much more dangerous. But I hold the moſt adviſed Courſe to be a little after the Blood-letting, to faſten many Cupping glaſſes, that the motion of the humors to the outward parts, may be hereby the more aſſiſted; of the Admonſtration of which cupping-glaſſes, we ſhal ſpeak by and by. Now it muſt be diligently noted, as we ſaid before, that we obſerve the time in which the <hi>Exanthemata</hi> do begin to appear. For if it be in the beginning of the diſeaſe and before the fourth day, in which time their breaking forth cannot be critical, and no help comes to the patient thereby; but the ſymptomes do rather grow more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in which regard blood-letting ought by no meanes to be hindred. But if they break forth after the fonrth day and that in great quantity, ſo that the ſick party is thereby bettered, and the ſymptoms leſſened; it is much betteer to abſtain from blood-letting, and to fix many Cupping-glaſſes with Scarrification, that the motion of the Humors out wards may thereby be wel furthered.</p>
                        <p>What wee have hitherto ſaid of blood-letting, is to be underſtood of opening a vein in the Arm, which does quickly diminiſh the blood. Howbeit ſomtimes, tis very profitable to open the inferior veins viz. if the patient be weak, and cannot ſuffer a reiteration of the former phlebotomy. But this is eſpecially good in women; for it is as <hi>Ribaſius</hi> ſaies Lib. 7. Chap. 10. proper to women and very efficatious, becauſe it imitates the manner of their Natural evacuations. Yea verily &amp; when they want their courſes that kind of bleeding is proper for women, becauſe naturally they have much blood in theſe veines which are high the womb. Alſo it is good for ſuch, in whom we fear a tranſlation of the matter into the brain, which is often wont to happen in theſe Feavers and to cauſe a Phrenſie. Which may be perceived eaſily (as we ſaid in the prognoſtick) by the Urins thin, white, and void of Color; and when the Urins are ſo, it wil be very good to open the inferior Veines. Alſo <hi>Oribaſius</hi> relates in the forecited place that he was taken with a peſtilential Feaver, and having two pound of blood drawn from his inferior veines, he recovered: and al that uſed the like bleeding, were recovered.</p>
                        <p>The opening of the Hemorrhoid veines by Horſleeches workes the ſame effect. For ſeeing by this meanes the blood is drawn out by little and little, there follows little abatement of ſtrength. Yet is the blood revelled from the in moſt bowells, where is wont to be the Heat and the Matter which foments the diſeaſe. and this is ſpecial good for Melanchollick perſons, becauſe in ſuch, Nature is wont to evacuate earthly blood, by theſe waies.</p>
                        <p>After Sufficient blood-letting, Revulſions muſt be celebrated by Cupping-glaſſes, both dry and with Scarrification. Dry ones, when we would only revel: but Scarrified ones when the redundancy of blood is not wholly taken away by blood-letting, which the patients ſtrength could no longer bear. For, blood is drawn by Cupping with much leſs expence of ſtrength and beſides the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous ſpirits lurking within, are thereby drawn to the Surface of the body. But Authors agree not touching the places where Cupping-glaſſes are to be applied: for ſome and eſpecialy al Italian Phyſitians very neer do hold they ought to be applied to the inferior parts viz. to the thighs and but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks and no where elſe, that the venemous matter may be drawn from the Heart to the moſt diſtant parts: but that they are not good to be faſtened to the ſhoulder blades or the Back, becauſe they draw hurtful humors from other parts towards the Heart. Others are of a contrary opinion, that Cupping-glaſſes are beſt to be applied to the ſhoulders and back, viz. that poiſonſom humors and vapors may be drawn from the Centre to the Circumference which motion is moſt ſuitable to the
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:49088:279"/>
motion of nature in this diſeaſe: But I am of opinion that Cupping. glaſſes ſhould be faſtened to each and every of the places aforeſaid; and that is is good to ſet them firſt upon the lower parts, that ſom portion of malignity may be drawn back unto the more remote parts: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Glaſſes fixed in thoſe parts, cannot ſufficiently draw back the venemous homors and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors from the heart and its neighboring parts; it is good to faſten them likewiſe to ſuch parts as are neer the heart viz. To the ſhoulders and back. For by this means the motion of nature is very much furthered, ſeeing that experience doth teach that the eruption of the ſpots is commonly in thoſe parts which by frequent fixing of cups is much furthered. Which <hi>Mercatus</hi> hath moſt elegantly delivered in theſe words. <hi>Howbeit in the mean time, while the Body is plied with other medicaments, ſmall cupping-glaſſes muſt either many at once, or a few frequently be applyed. And if the venom of the diſeaſe or the weakneſs of the Patient be much, they may be fixed without any, or with very little ſcarrification. In which kind of uſe and upon that occaſion, it is the beſt courſe to ſcarrify thoſe which are ſet upon the Back over againſt the heart which experience hath taught to be of ſuch moment that. Anxieties &amp; Inequalitie of the Pulſe, and other grevious accidents have thereupon ceaſed. Wherefore we muſt not ceaſe applying of them, until the venemous accidents are mitigated or whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken away.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But the Reaſon urged by thoſe of the former opinion, is of ſmall moment for the fear leſt ill humors ſhould be drawn from other parts unto the Heart. For this reaſon might peraduenter be of ſom force: if they ſhould be uſed at the beginning of the diſeaſe the whol body being ful of humors. But after an univerſal evacuation ſufficiently procured by blood-leting they can cauſe no ſuch danger; which is made manifeſt by a clear example drawn from a pleuriſie, in whoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, if the pained ſide ſhould be cupt, doubtleſs it would bring the Humors more and more to the greived part. But when after often blood letting a cupping-glaſs is fixed upon the pained ſide, it doth not only draw nothing from other parts to the place affected, but that humor which is fixed and wedged into the part is thereby powerfully drawn out, ſo that ofttimes the diſeaſe is thereby perfectly cured. Although in this diſeaſe, there is more danger of drawing Humors to the part affected, becauſe it is in a manner externall and neer the Cupping<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Zacutus Luſitanus</hi> in <hi>Obſerv. 13. Lib 5. Praxeos admirandoe</hi> doth very much commend cups with ſcarrification, faſtened neer the groins and armpits. for by ſuch cuppingglaſſes ſo fixed the vitious humor is drawn to the ignoble parts and to thoſe common Emunctories, unto which nature is wont to expel the ſame.</p>
                        <p>Among revulſive remedies, Frictions may very will be reckoned, being often exerciſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the extream parts of the Body with a courſ cloth. But that Friction is moſt commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. which is made upon the whol Body with the Liniment of Aetius, which is thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</p>
                        <p>Take of ſweet Almonds and fountain water of each three ounces: Sal nitre two drams. Boil them together til the water be conſumed, and with this Oyl warmed, let the patients body be rubbed al over with the hands being dipped therein. <hi>Aetius</hi> doth preſcribe Oyl of Savin, but becauſe it is too hot. Oyl of ſweet Almonds was by <hi>Baptiſta Montanus,</hi> fitly ſubſtituted in its place. This oyntment doth open the pores of the Skin, that nature may more fitly expel the venemous vapors thereby.</p>
                        <p>Veſicatories do likewiſe powerfully draw out evil and venemous juyces and ſerve for revulſion being applied in divers parts of the body: Commonly they are applyed to the hinder part of the neck; for they do both draw out the matter, and drive it from the head, and ſerve well to cure ſuch ſleepie ſymptoms as are uſual in theſe diſeaſes. But where great malignity doth poſſes the whol Body and grevious ſymptoms afflict the patients, one veſicatory will not ſuffice but more muſt be laid on: I am wont when the diſeaſe is very violent to lay them on in five places viz. The Neck, both the Arms on the inſide between the bending of the Arm and the Shoulder, and to both the Thighs, in the ſpace between the Groyn and the Knee, with happy ſucceſs.</p>
                        <p>The great profit of this Remedy we may learn from <hi>Galen,</hi> who in <hi>Lib 5. Method. Cap.</hi> 12. relates, that of peſtilential Feaver al recovered, who happened to have exulcerations in divers parts of their Bodyes; becauſe the morbifick matter was evacuated by thoſe ulcers. And becauſe the uſe of theſe Veſicatories do often caus the Strangury (for the Canthari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des do by a peculiar propertie affect the Bladder) it wil be good when they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, to give the Patient emulſion, that may temper the acrimony of the urine. This ſymptome may likewiſe be prevented by mingling the poudered Seeds of Ameos with the veſicant plaiſter, which ſeeds have the faculty to keep the Cantharides from hurting the bladder</p>

                        <p>

                        </p>
                        <p>To this Cataplaſm may profitably be added leaves of Rue, Nettle, Sage, Scordium, Pidgeons dung, juice of Rue and Vinegar.</p>

                        <p>Theſe revulſory Remedies have place during the whol Courſe of the diſeaſe after univerſal eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations viz. Phlebotomy and Purgation: of the uſe whereof we are now to ſpeak, that ſo we may paſs from Chyrurgery to Pharmaceutick Remedies.</p>
                        <p>Now it is much controverted among Practitioners, whether we ought to purge in the beginning of malignant Feavers. Many reject purging at that time, not only becauſe of that wel known pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> that Concocted humors are to be purged, but crude humors not: but alſo becauſe in this diſeaſe the malignant humors are too much exaſperated by purgations, and diffuſe their malignant quality the more abroad, and by ſharpely provoking or Nature, they produce pernicious fluxes wheras otherwiſe of themſelves in theſe Feavers, melting fluxes. do often ariſe and bring the patients to their long home. But others contend, that ſometimes there is ſuch plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of evil and venemous humors in the firſt paſſages, that unleſs they be firſt removed by purging, or very much leſſened, they infect the reſt of the humors, ſo that Nature cannot maſter them, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever aſſiſted by antidotes and corroborating medicaments.</p>
                        <p>We conceive this Controverſie may be thus compoſed; viz. that in the beginning of this diſeaſe we muſt abſtain from purgations for the reaſons fore alleaged; and that the ſink of putrid humors which lies in the firſt paſſages (which the truth is do very much hinder the Cure) be drawn away rather by frequent Clyſters, than purging Medicaments. Howbeit, if their be ſo great a quantity of il humors in the firſt Region, that it ſeemes impoſible ſufficiently to evacuate the ſame by Clyſters (which chiefly happens, when evil humors abound in the ſtomach, and then there is great loathing of meate, bitterneſs in the mouth, ſtomach ſickneſs and vomiting) or when there are many worms, it is very good in ſuch a Caſe to draw away the matter by a purging medicament that the morbifick matter contained in the veines, may afterward bee the more eaſily ſubdued. Which matter it is that cannot be purged before concoction, and of that muſt the ſaying of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> be underſtood, that onely concocted humors muſt be purged. But the matter contained in the firſt region and that maſs of excrements may be drawn away without any preparation or concoction premiſed, and is ordinarily purged out only by Clyſters, as we ſaid before. Now thoſe Medicaments which we give to purge the firſt Region, muſt be choſen from amongſt the moſt be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And it is Scarce lawful to ariſe to Senna and Rhubarb, or at leaſt to mix them with the others in a ſmal quantity, when a great abundance of evil humors do afflict the patient. The former of theſe Medicaments were propounded in our cure of continual putrid Feavers, and how we ſhould purge in the beginning of them.</p>
                        <p>But Clyſters are to be uſed, not only in the beginning of the diſeaſe, to free the firſt region from excrements; but they are to be given in the whol Courſe of the Diſeaſe, if the patient be not looſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellied, and that every or every other day.

Whereunto muſt be added ſuch things as by a Specifick property do fight againſt the venemous quality, commonly called Alexipharmaca or Antidotes, as rootes of Cinkfoyl, Tormentil, white Thiſtle; leaves of Scordium, Carduus, Scabious, Scorzonera, Meddow-ſweet; Flowers of Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>golds, <hi>Vetonica rubra;</hi> bitts of Lemmons or Citrons and their ſeeds; Skinns of odoriferous apples, Shavings of Harts-horn &amp;c. with the Syrups of Lemmons, Pomgranats, Vinegar, of the juyce of Sorrel &amp;c. and we muſt frequently mix tart things with them ſuch as juyce of Citrons, or of Lemmons, Spirit of ſulphur or of vitriol: for they do mightily reſiſt the putrefaction and the venemous quality.</p>
                        <p>Touching the Pome-Citron <hi>Athenaeus</hi> reports, that once in <hi>Aegypt</hi> certain condemned men were expoſed to death by biting of beaſts, and they were bitten indeed by the Aſpes, but had no harm thereby: becauſe as they were led to executiou, a Woman out of Pitty gave them ſome Pome-Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons to refreſh them &amp; quench their thirſt: which having eaten, they received no hurt by the biting of thoſe venemous Beaſts. Now al parts of the Pome-Citron have an antidotary quality; and therefore it is profitably cut in pieces rind and al, and boiled with Rootes and Herbs aforeſaid to make juleps; and it is likewiſe to good purpoſe ſteeped in ſmal drink which the patient ordinarily uſes, unto which it gives a fragrant ſmel from its rind and a tartnes from its pulp: howbeit the juice only hath a cooling faculty.</p>
                        <p>The acid ſpirits of ſulphur and vitriol are highly extolled eſpecially by Chymiſt, and their rare vertues approved by long experience have cauſed that long ſince they have bin entertained by Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leniſts, and ordinarily preſcribed.

The ſecond Tribe contains ſuch as by their coldneſs and the tenuity of their ſubſtance do reſiſt putrefaction, and reſtrain the venemous Quality; as Juyce of Lemmons, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Sulphur and of Vitriol, as al acid things, and Vinegar it ſelf. The third comprehends hot &amp; Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoretick medicaments, which expel venemous Humors and Vapors from the Heart, and bring them from the Centre to the Circumference; as Angellica, Zedoary, Dictamnus, Meddow-ſweet, Scordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, Carduus, Scabious, Treacle, Mithridate, Treacle water. The fourth contains ſuch as by a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifical vertue, without any exceſs of the firſt Qualities, do oppugn the venemous Quality; as Bezoar ſtone, Harts-horn, Unicorns-Horn, Troches of Vipers, and ſuch like.</p>

                        <p>Bezoar ſtone is given alone to the quantity of five or ſix graines, with water of Mead-ſweet, Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zonera, Carduus, or ſuch like not only to oppoſe the malignant quality, but alſo to help the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoretick motion; for this ſtone is reputed for a ſweating Medicament, which notwithſtanding many approved Authors doubt of, becauſe they could never ſee any ſenſible effect, by the giving thereof. And truly (to ſpeak out my mind) there can no great Confidence be put in this ſtone; becauſe although we may allow to the true and genuine bezoar ſtone, thoſe faculties which are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto aſcribed; yet becauſe the great price thereof Cauſes that many Traders take a world of paines to ſophiſticate the ſame, we can now a dayes hardly get any but counterfeit. A clear teſtimony whereof is, that the writers of the Indian Hiſtories do aver that Bezoar ſtone is very ſcarce and of great price among the Indians themſelves; when we have plenty of them and cheap enough.</p>
                        <p>More credit ſhould of right be given to that ſame Root, which the Spaniards have in this Age of ours brought out of Italy; which they cal <hi>Contra yerva</hi> which ſignifies the Poiſon-pelting or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidotary Herb, becauſe the pouder thereof is a preſent remedy againſt poiſons, and drives them out of the body by ſweat, or inſenſible tranſpiration. And they Conceive that Plant to be the Common ordinary food, of Thoſe beaſts in which the Bezoar ſtone is found, and that the ſtone hath its vertue primarily from thence. A ſcruple or half a dram of this Root poudered may be given in Carduus matter, or other medicaments.</p>

                           <hi>Mendererus</hi> cries up this following pouder.</p>

But the Author doth adviſe that in great paines of the head or ſtomach, Camphire is warily to be uſed; which yet he highly commends in peſtilential diſeaſes; and avouches that ſeaſonably given, il doth more good than the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious bezoardick medicaments. I conceive the pouder is too hot becauſe of the Ginger, and I have
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:49088:281"/>
Compoſed this following in imitation thereof, Which I have vſed with happy ſucceſs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Take mineral Bezoar three drams: Sal prunella two drams: Camphire one dram. Make of all a pouder: Give one dram at a time in Carduus water, or ſom other convenient Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor.</p>
                        <p>Pouders may likewiſe be made of the fragments of precious ſtones whoſe vertues many deride &amp; others as much admire; ſo that from the times of the Arabian Phyſitians to our days many compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are prepared of them in the ſhops, as <hi>Electuarium de Gemmis, &amp; Confectio de Hyacintho.</hi> But in peſtilential and venemous diſeaſes many have extolled the great vertu of the Smaragd, amongſt the reſt <hi>Avenzoar, Mindererus,</hi> and <hi>Zacutus Luſitanus. Avenzoar 2 Teiſir. tract. 1. Cap.</hi> 5. That himſelf being poyſoned, was thereby cured. <hi>Mindererus Lib. de Peſtilentia Cap,</hi> 15. Relates that to a woman in a Peſtilential Feaver who abhorred al Phyſick, he gave the following Pouder which ſhe might eaſily ſwallow haveing neither taſt nor ſmel; which when ſhee had taken the conbuſtions of cruel ſymptomes being allaied, and the diſeaſe turning to health, ſhe was cured.</p>
                        <p>Take of the Smaragd ſtone prepared, Eaſt-india Bezoar of each ſix grains: Hyacinth prepared three graines, mix them. Make of all a pouder for one Doſe.</p>
                        <p>And <hi>Zacutus Luſitanus,</hi> relates that a Portugal Gentleman, haveing through poyſon fallen into a looſneſs and a Conſumption, from which no abſterſives, aſtringents or Antidotes could free him; he was cured only by the Smaragd, the pouder whereof to the quantity of twelve graines he tooke every other day in conſerve of quinces, and when he had taken it five times he was cured of his Looſneſs.</p>
                        <p>The Phyſitians of <hi>Mountpelier,</hi> doe uſe in this Feaver as a moſt profitable Antidote, no ways heating; the Troches of Vipers, which are uſually prepared as an ingredient into An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dromachus Treacle, which they give from one ſcruple to half a dram in cordial waters or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leps.</p>
                        <p>Yet the fleſh of vipers were better being dried, which hath no venemous quality (as people imagine) but is rather a potent Antidote; which is much abated by boiling; for it is boiled in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to make the troches. So that we ſee greater effects wrought only by the heart and Liver of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, being dryed, without any other preparation</p>
                        <p>The Alexipharmick Medicaments of the third Tribe viz. The Diaphoreticks and ſweaters muſt be given only in the ſtate or declination of the diſeaſe, as was ſaid before. which is to be underſtood, when they are given in a feaver ſimply malignant or ſpotted: for in the true Plague they muſt be uſed at the very beginning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the venemous qualitie which would quickly kill the Patient may be ſuddenly and potently oppoſed, and the malignant vapors diſcuſſed. Yea ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily and in ſimple malignant Feavers, if the venemous quality ſeem to be greater than the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction they are likewiſe to be given at the beginning in ſmall quantity; making choyce of ſuch as are leaſt hot, mixing them with Juleps and other cooling medicines formerly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed.</p>
                        <p>Now of theſe Diaphoretick medicaments there are divers degrees, for ſom are more hot, as Angelica, Zedoary, Dictamnum, Treacle, Mithridate, Treakle water; which are never to be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en when the heat of the Feaver is at the higheſt, but only when the ſame is much abated, and when the ſigns of malignity do very much prevail. But others are leſs hot, as Scabious, Carduus Mead-ſweet, Scordium, which may ſafely be given, though the Feaver be in it's height. And theſe diſtinctions are carefully to be obſerved in practice. and as for the formes of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar medicaments, every Phyſitian can vary them, according to the different degree of the Feaveriſh Heat and of the Malignitie. But I ſhall here diſcribe ſuch as are moſt effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all</p>
                        <p>Take water of Mead-ſweet and Carduus of each two ounces: juice of Lemmons one ounce: old Treakle half a dram, two ſcruples or one dram, according as the fear of heating the Patient is more or leſs. Mix al into a potion. give it warm and cover the patient ſomwhat more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary. if there be great vehemency of ſymptoms, new Treakle wil be more convenient, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the vigor of the Opium by means of which the vehemency of the ſymptoms will be allaied, and the boyling of the Humors wil be reſtrained: yea and ſomtimes when it ſeems unconvenient to uſe Treakle as in the beginning of the diſeaſe eſpecially, <hi>Laudanum Opiatum</hi> given to two grains &amp; mingled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with Antidotes, do much good. For by the Narcotick and congealing power thereof thoſe fervent Spirits ſo vexatious to the Heart, are as it were fixed; and the morbifick matter (which is moſt pernicious while it is in motion) is thereby ſtopped and remains in a manner unmoveable, whence it comes to paſs, that Nature not being provoked by the malignant humors and ſpirits, recollecting her ſtrength, doth more eaſily apply unto her ſelf the vertu of Antidotes</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="632" facs="tcp:49088:282"/>Aqua theriacalis ſeems fit to be preferred before Treacle it ſelf. For ſeeing it is exceeding thin and ſpiritous, it doth more eaſily and ſuddenly peirce into and paſs through the whol body and Cauſe ſweat. And becauſe there are many deſcriptions of Treacle water, their doſe ought to differ accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they are compounded of Simples more or leſs healing. I ſhal in this place propound the chief.</p>
                        <p>And firſt of al, the Treacle water of Bauderon is moſt excellent, becauſe it is exceeding temperate. For there goes no other Liquor thereinto than Vineger and Juyce of Lemmons, by which the hot Ingredients are very much tempered, and therefore it may be given from half an ounce to an ounce in Sudorofick decoctions or waters. And although this is leſs heating than any of the reſt preſcribed by divers other Authors; yet have I invented another, eaſily made, which is more cooling, and does no leſs oppoſe the Feaver than the malignant quality, and may conſequently be uſed in the whol courſe of the diſeaſe, at any period thereof. Its compoſition is as followeth.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Take twelve freſh and juycie Lemmons. Take away the bark or rind and the ſeeds and preſs out the fuyce, and ad thereunto the ſaid rindes and ſeeds; and three pints of juyce of Scordium, juyce of ſorrel, of Goates Rue; of ſcabious, and Carduus, of each one pint. Shavings of Harts-Horn four Ounces. Old Venice Treacle ſix ounces. Let the rinds of the Lemmons be cutt into thin chips, let the ſeeds be beaten, and ſuch herbs as have little juyce, let them in the beating be moiſtened with the juice of Lemmons and let al be diſtilled in balneo Mariae. Of the water give one ounce by it ſelf or mixed with other Liquors.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The hotter ſort of Treacle waters are made with white Wine or with ſpirit of wine; which muſt be warilly given and in leſſer quantity; yet they pierc more than the other and move ſweat, and are cheifly uſed in the true Peſtilence. Howbeit in ſome Caſes they may by the prudent Phyſitian be uſed. Among the many Deſcriptions of ſuch Treacle waters, I wil propound in this place, two of the moſt excellent.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Take roots of Angelica, White-Thiſtle, Gentian, Tormentil, Zedoary, Harts-Horn, of each one ounce. of the three ſanders, of each half an ounce. Treacle three ounces, Camphire a ſcruple. beat al and ſteep them three daies together in two Pints of ſtrong white-wine, in a warm place. Then diſtil Them in</hi> Balneo Mariae, <hi>and keep the water for uſe, the doſe is, from two drams to half an ounce, in refrigerating Juleps, adding ſpirit of vitriol to correct the Inflamation thereof.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Take Spirit of Wine, very wel rectified one pint and an half. old Treacle eight ounces. Elect Mirrh four ounces. Oriental Saffron one ounce. Camphire half an ounce. Infuſe al for twenty four hours in</hi> Balneo Mariae. <hi>afterward ſtil them in the ſame Bath; and you ſhal have a very effectual water.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Chymiſts do exceedingly cry up their <hi>Bezoardica Mineralia,</hi> becauſe they are Sudorofick or Diaphoretick at leaſt and yet do not at al heat: which they endeavor to prove by their having no taſte, in which regard they are eaſily taken even by the moſt nice Patients, that loath unpleaſant medicaments. They alſo commend their Medicine which is called by them <hi>Mixtura Simplex</hi> or <hi>Mixtura Spiritalis,</hi> made of Treacle Water Camphorated, ſpirit of Vitriol and of Tartar: and they mingle a dram hereof in Juleps and antidotary Potions.</p>
                        <p>A Phyſitian that undertakes the Cure of malignant Feavers ought to have divers Antidotes in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynes, and to change them ever and anon, leaſt nature be too much accuſtomed to one and the ſame, and ſlight the virtue thereof. Alſo the nature of the venemous quality is not alwayes one and the ſame but very divers according to the diverſity of the patients bodies. So that what hath helpt one, wil do another no good; ſo that when he hath for ſome time uſed one antidote, he muſt try another and another.</p>
                        <p>While the foreſaid diaphoreticks are uſing, if we have a Mind at any time to help their Operation, that they may more powerfully bring out the poiſon into the ſurface of the Body, ſome external helpes may be uſed: viz. Cupping-glaſſes, both dry and with ſcarification, many and often ſet on and Veſicatories, of which we ſpok before; which are moſt convenient in the ſtate of the diſeaſe and at what time Sudorofick Medicines are given; as alſo Oyl of Scorpions of Matthiolus, which is much commended by al Practitioners; for it calls forth the poyſon reſiding in the profound parts of the body unto the external parts, And therefore the Emunctories of the body, as the Groines and Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, with the Pulſes of the Templs, Hands and Feet, ought frequently to be anointed with this oyl warm; viz. thrice or four times in a day, or elſe every third hour. Where this Oyl is not to be had, a Liniment may be made of Treacle diſſolved in Juyce of Lemmons adding a little ſaffron and Camphire.</p>
                        <p>If at any time Nature being oppreſſed with the malignity of the Poyſon and overcome, and ſeem not to act, but as it were to ſubmit her ſelf with hands bound to the mercy of the humor. The ſtrongeſt diaphoreticks, are then to be given, in a large doſe, that the daunted mettle of the heart may be as it were ſpurred up, And then the ſtrongeſt ſorts of Treacle waters and Bezoardicks which have greateſt force to penetrate, muſt be uſed: and the addition of Camphire wil much help their penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and outwardly, at ſuch a time this following fomentation, wil wonderfully aſſiſt the operation of
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:49088:282"/>
ſuch things as are taken in, and wil help to drive out the malignant vapors. For by this Method, many have bin reduced from the Gates of Death.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Take roots of Angelica and Gentian, of each two ounces, Leaves of Bawm, Origanum, Scordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, of each two handfuls. Seeds of Carduus benedictus one ounce. Flowers of Chamomel, Mullien, Melilot, St. Johns wort, Centaurie the leſs, Staechados, Roſemary, Marygold, of each two pugills. Make a decoction of all in water, adding towards the end a little white-wine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with foment the feet, Groins, Armepits, and ſides warm with ſponges.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If drynes of the tongue, thirſt and other ſignes do ſhew that the Feaver doth prevail as much as the malignant quality, we muſt abſtain from the fomentation, and inſtead thereof let a Hen cut down through the Back, or the Lungs or Caul of a Wether new killed, be applied to the patients Belly.</p>
                        <p>In the whole Courſe of the Care, the greateſt Cure of al muſt be to preſerve the patients ſtrength, which is much dejected by the Venemous quality. It is beſt kept up, firſt by Convenient broths made with a Capon, unto which, when neceſſity urges may be added the diſtilled broaths of fleſh, and eſpecially the <hi>Aqua Caponis</hi> which is made in <hi>Balneo Mariae per Deſcenſum,</hi> as the common manner is now to make it. Conſection of Hyacinths given in broaths, doth repaire the ſtrength, and doth oppugn the malignant quality. In the ſame broaths Gelly of harts-horn, doth ſatiſfie both Endications. If the ſtrength of the Patient be very much decaied; we may make bold with <hi>Confectio Alkermes,</hi> provided the Heat of the Feaver be not very violent. And finally, wine is the moſt cordial thing in the world, of the uſe whereof in this diſeaſe, I ſpake before, treating of the Patients Diet. The only ſmel of wine doth much refreſh the Patients ſtrength, and much more a toaſt dipped in Canary and Roſewater and ſo held to the Noſe.</p>
                        <p>And in this Caſe alſo <hi>Confectio Alkermes</hi> and <hi>de Hyacintho</hi> are wont to be put into alexiphar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Potions. Or in extream dejection of ſtrength, Potions merely cordial may be thus made.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Orenge-flower water and Roſewater of each one ounce and an half. Confectio Alkermes one dram. Syrup of Apples one ounce. Juyce of Lemmons three drams. Make all into a potion. If the Feaver be not intenſe Cinnamon water may be given to the quantity of one dram or three drams. and ſometimes Amber Grieſe may be added, to the quantity of five Granes or Seven. Neither in extream Weaknes of the Patients muſt we ſo much fear thoſe hot cordials, that we ſhould reſuſe to ſave the patient from preſent death, for fear of augmenting the Heat of the Feaver for we muſt alwaies regard that which is moſt preſſing, and when the patient hath a little recovered ſtrength if the hot cordials have made ſome increaſe of Heat, it may afterward be tempered by potent coolers, as Sal Prunella, and Spirit of vitriol, mixed in juleps and ordinary Drink. This Method being obſerved by the diſcreet Phyſitian, in his adminiſtration both of Strengtheners and of hot Antidotes and ſweaters; wil prove happily Succeſsful.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>After theſe things, muſt follow the Application of Epithems and Liveing Creatures to the Region of the Heart; fomentation of the Genitalls with Confectio Alkermes diſſolved in Wine; Bags to be laied upon the ſtomach, and other both internal and external Medicaments, largly by me deſcribed in my Chapter of Weaknes or Decay of ſtrength.</p>
                        <p>As for Epithems, there is Caution to be uſed in their application, Becauſe very many Authors do wholly reject the uſe of them; becauſe they are wont to be compounded of refrigerating and repelling things; viz. of the waters of cooling herbs and Vinegar, by which the venemous quality is beaten back to the heart, and the tranſpiration thereof, which ought alwaies to be promoted, is hindered. But this reaſon cannot hinder the uſe of Epithemes, ſeeing we may compound them of cordial and diaphoretick waters that have repelling no or aſtringent quality in them, and without Vinegar (which ſome do yet allow) adding cordials thereunto; and by theſe things mingled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, Epithems may be made, not only which ſtrengthen the heart, but alſo open the pores of the skin, that through them the malignant vapors may more eaſily tranſpire. Of ſuch Epithems this may be an example.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>waters of ſcabious and Carduus, of each four ounces. Oreng-flower water two ounces. Con'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectio Alkermes two drams. Powder of Diamargaritum frigidum one dram. Saffron and Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire of each ſix grains. Make an Epitheme and applie it warm to the Region of the Heart fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenly.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Confectio Alkermes half an ounce, Powder of Triaſantalon and Diamargaritum frigidum, of each one dram and half, a little Orengflower water. Make of al a Liniment to be applied to the part after aforeſaid the uſe of the foreſaid Epitheme.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Neither muſt we here omit ſuch Epithemes as are to be applied to the parts under the ſhort ribbs, becauſe of the reaſons of their uſe propounded in the Cure of putrid Feavers, from whence the Materialls muſt alſo be fetcht.</p>
                        <p>At length whenas the malignant and venemous quality is maſtered by the Remedies afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faid,
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:49088:283"/>
and the Feaver abated and the Diſeaſe begins to decline, and the signs of Coction do mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly appear; pargation muſt be uſed, which by the experienced Phyſitian may be accomodated to the ſtrength and conſtitution of the Patient. I ſhal here, for the ſake of Beginners propound only one example.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Take Senna half an ounce. Annis ſeed one dram. Leaves of Scabious and Scordium, of each half an handful. Liquoris three drains. Boil al to three ounces. In the ſtrained Liquor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the infuſion of four ſcruples of Rhubarb Made in bugloſs water with yellow Sanders. Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na and Syrup of Roſes of each one ounce. Make all into a Potion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And for the moſt part one purge is not ſufficient in the declination of the diſeaſe when the Patient begins to recover health; but purgation muſt oftentimes be repeated twice or three times at conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent diſtances, that the evil humors may be perfectly rooted out. Otherwise there wil be danger of a Relapſe, or at leaſt the Patient wil be long in Recovering prſecte health. Becauſe though nature; be ſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>For the perfect Compleating of this Cure, it remaines onely that we ſpeak ſomething of the Correction of ſuch ſymptomes as happen in this diſeaſe. Now their cure is very near the ſame which hath bin propounded in the ſecond ſection of this Treatiſe Chap. 2. where we delivered the Cure of ſuch ſymptomes as attend putrid Feavers. And the ſymptoms of this Feaver are the ſame in a manner with thoſe of putrid Feavers, the difference being only in degrees of more or leſs; and therefore the ſame Remedies wil ſute with both. Howbeit I ſhal here ſet down ſuch things as have bin frequently tried in the taming of ſuch ſymptomes as attend malignant and Peſtilential Feavers, and which have proved moſt ſucceſsful. And wee ſhal withal declare the Cure of ſuch diſeaſes as do Supervene upon theſe Feavers.</p>
                        <p>And firſt of al, In Paines of the Head, Want of ſleep, and Raving, at the beginning Revellers of al ſorts muſt be uſed, as opening of the inferior veins and of the Haemorrhoids; emollient Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, frictions of the nether parts, Cupping-glaſſes, firſt ſet upon the Calves of the Legs, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards upon the Back and ſhoulders, both dry and with ſcarification; and Veſicatories, which in a ſimple Delirium or Dotage ariſing from a Chollerick matter, muſt be applied to the Armes and thighes. But if with the Raving there be joyned a dullnes and ſleepvnes, a Veſicatory muſt be applied alſo to the Neck; and then Repellers muſt be applied unto the Forehead and <hi>Oxyrrhodines;</hi> of which it is to be noted, that they are not ſo good in malignant as in meer putrid Feavers; becauſe the venemous vapors muſt by al meanes be expelled, and at no hand be kept within the body. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore firſt gentle repellers muſt be applied, and if the vehemence of the foreſaid ſymptomes ſhal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel us to fly to the ſtronger, we muſt not uſe them long together.</p>
                        <p>Among Repellers of the gentler ſort is reckoned that common frontal of the flowers of water Lilly Violets and Roſes, the greater cool ſeeds and Chermes berries, bedewed with the Vapour of vineger, And if that wil not ſuffice, let this following be laid on.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Unguentum populeum one ounce, Conſerve of Roſes and violets of each half an ounce. Oyl. of Roſes ſix ounces. Vinegar of Roſes two drams. Mix them all and receive them in tow and put them between two cloaths and apply them to the forehead.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mean while the Emulſions of the four greater cool ſeeds may be uſed, from which cool and gentle vapors are wont to be carried unto the Brain, which are wont to mitigate the foreſaid ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes. Which if they ſuffice not, narcoticks may be added, which do wonderfully hinder the aſcent of ſharp and malignant Vapors unto the brain, and procure ſleep. Yet they muſt be given in a ſmal quantity, as half an ounce of Syrup of poppies; or if neceſſity compel, two graines of Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum opiatum with conſerve of roſes may wel be given; or they may be diſſolved in ſome Julep; or in ſtead there of new Treacle may be given to the Quantity of half a dram. Howbeit theſe nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coticks are ſeldom to be given and in ſmal Quantity, becauſe they Concentre the poyſon, howbeit they are by ſome accounted ſudoroſicks.</p>
                        <p>After repellers have bin uſed a day or two, we muſt come to derivers, among which is reckoned a veſicatory applied to the Neck of which before, whereunto muſt be added blood-letting from the forehead vein to the quantity of five or ſix ounces: which is very ſucceſsful provided blood was before ſufficiently taken from the veins of the Arm. Alſo horſeleeches may be faſtened behind the Eares. which is a good remedy but leſs effectual than the former, becauſe by leeches the thinner part only of the blood is drawn away; whereas by the forehead vein ſometimes in a phrenſie more corrupt blood is drawn away; whereas by the Arm. At length, in the ſtate of a Phrenſie, or at the beginning of the declination, reſolvers are to be applied, eſpecially liveing Creatures and their Parts, as the Lunges of a wether which is better than young prdgeons or whelpes, becauſe it doth ſafely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs the whol Head. Now theſe Animals do partly reſove evil humors contained in the brain, and partly ripen and digeſt them, that Nature may afterward more eaſily expel them, Some do unadviſedly apply them in the beginning of a phrenſie, becauſe by encreaſing the Heat, they encreaſe

                           <pb facs="tcp:49088:284"/>
                           <pb n="635" facs="tcp:49088:284"/>
the Flux of Humors to the Brain, and encreaſe the Raving.</p>
                        <p>In the Inflamation, Dryneſs, and Blackneſs of the Tongue, Remedies propounded in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid place are convenient; eſpecially ſuch as are compoſed of Water, or the Juyce of Houſleek, and Sal prunellae. Whereunto this following of <hi>Mindereus</hi> may be added, becauſe Experience hath taught, that it is very effectual.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>freſh butter waſhed in Roſe-water, two ounces: Sal prunelloe half a dram. Mix them, and keep the mixture in cold Water. Give the quantity of an Haſtifer or bean, oftentimes in a day, and let the Patients hold it as long in their Mouths, as they can poſſibly. It is a ſign that the Cure goes wel forward, if the black Sootineſs go away, and the dry chopped Tongue begin to grow moiſt, and pselings come away, and the dry chopped Tongue begin to grow cough up the peelings of their Throats. But then their palate is pained, and that very thin Skin where with it is covered, can hardly bear any thing in regard of its tenderneſs, but its offended with every light tartneſs, and the leaſt Acrimony imaginable, becauſe the former Inflamation having left it in divers parts Flaid, it muſt be covered with new Skin; and ſo it requires to be perfectly cooled and healed. To this purpoſe the following Gelly wil be moſt convenient.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Seeds of Flea-bane and Quinces, of each one dram and an half: Gum Tragacanth one dram. With Water of Roſes draw out a liquid Mucilage, whereunto ad the like quantity of Syrup of Violets. Make it in manner of a Gelly; of which let the patients take often in a Spoon and hold it long in their Mouth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Warm Milk does mitigate the pain Cauſed by Gargariſmes, tempers the Inflamation, moiſtens the Tongue and Throat, and attracts the Venom to it.</p>
                        <p>Theſe following Pills may conveniently be uſed.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Seeds of Cucumbers picked and bruiſed, one ounce: White of an Egg as much as ſhall ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Make Pills, which let the Patients often hold in their mouths.</hi> Or,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Take Seeds of Gourds and Melones clenſed, and of white Poppy, of each one dram. Liquoris and Gum Tragaganth of each one dram and an half. Beat all to pouder, and with the Mucilage of Quince Seeds drawn with Roſe-water, make Pills to be held in the mouth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And becauſe this Inflamation, Dryneſs, and Blackneſs of the Tongue, proceeds from the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that is within. Juleps very Refrigerating are good to cool the ſame; unto which may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, Sal prunellae, and Spirit of Vitriol. Alſo they may be mingled with the Patients ordinary drink.</p>
                        <p>The Cure of extremity of Thirſt was ſufficiently propounded in the aforeſaid place. But in a malignant Feaver, it will be happily extinguiſhed, with theſe two Medicines newly commended, viz. with Sal Prunellae, and Spirit of Vitriol, taken in Juleps, and in the ordinary drink of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient.</p>
                        <p>Want of Appetite, Stomach-ſickneſs, Vomiting, and Hiccuping, muſt be cured according to the Method delivered in the aforeſaid Chapter. Yet we ſhall ad one thing touching vomiting; that it doth ſomtimes ſo vex thoſe that have malignant Feavers, that they preſently vomit what ever they take, and though they have Thirſt, with Dryneſs and Blackneſs of Tongue; yet can they bear no kind of Liquor or drink: but vomit all their Juleps, Emulſions, Ptiſans, and their ſmal Beer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after they have drunk them. This moſt grievous Symptom is ſuddenly cured, as it were by a miracle, with a dram of Salt of Wormwood, given in a ſpoonful of freſh Juyce of Lemmons, as I have learnt by Experience.</p>
                        <p>A Looſneſs is very frequent in this Diſeaſe, and herein the wiſdom of the Phyſitian is very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. For if it be unſeaſonably ſtopped, the venemous Matter is kept within. And if it be let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, it weakens the Patients, and many times brings them to their deaths. In the Cure of this Looſneſs, we muſt therefore thus proceed. If it be ſo moderate that it weaken not the Patient, it muſt not be ſtopt, but only moderated by Strengthening Clyſters, But if it be immoderate, and do very much weaken the Patient, it is wont to be a melting Looſneſs, that Thawes the Patient as it were away, and muſt be boldly ſtopped; which new Treacle to the quantity of half a dram, or Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum Opiatum, to the quantity of two or three grains, will effectually perform. Yet I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſeen a pernicious Flux which threatned to kill the Patient, ſtopped as it were in a Moment, by giving of powerful Diaphoreticks in a great Doſe; which did expel by the Skin that venemous Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which by vexing and grating upon the Guts, and other Bowels, did cauſe ſuch a melting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming Looſneſs.</p>
                        <p>Worms do very often vex thoſe that have theſe Feavers, and are plentifully bred by the great pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction of the Humors. Theſe are conveniently drawn away by ſweet Clyſters, and by potions againſt the Worms; eſpecially ſuch as are made of a Decoction of Seordium. For Scordium is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually good againſt the malignity and the Worms. And to temper the heat thereof, it muſt be boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Purſlain, Sorrel, and Harts-horn. Alſo burnt Harts-horn is profitably boiled againſt the
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:49088:285"/>
Worms. For <hi>Foreſtus</hi> in the fourth <hi>Obſerv.</hi> of his ſixth Book, that no Remedy did ſo much good to ſuch as having a malignant Feaver were troubled with Worms and a Looſneſs, as burnt Harts-horn given to the quantity of a dram in convenient Juleps.</p>
                        <p>When the malignant and venemous Quality bears great ſway in theſe Feavers, that they come neer the Nature of the true Peſt; in ſuch Patients there are commonly riſings behind their Ears, and Carbuncles. Wherefore we will here ſubjoyn their Cure.</p>
                        <p>In the beginning of a Parotis, or Riſing neer the Ear, as ſoon as it begins to appear, the Part recipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent muſt be relaxed and widened as it were, and if the ſwelling riſe but ſlowly, the motion of Nature endeavoring to expel the morbifick matter that way muſt be aſſiſted, by applying drawing things to the ſwelling, and by giving Antidotes and Diaphoreticks. To relax the Part, make an Injection of Oyntment of Marſh-mallows, and lay on afterwards moiſt Wool which is greaſie, from the Sheep. Attraction may be cauſed by applying Whelps, or yong Pigeons, by which alſo the pain will be mitigated. Plaiſters made of Leven, Figs, Onions, Doves-dung, adding thereto butter, Hens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greaſe, freſh Hogs-greaſe, and Oyl of Lillies, or ſweet Almonds. If by theſe Attractives the Part be over-heated, and the pain be too much encreaſed; they may be omitted by fits, laying on in the mean time the Cataplaſm made of the Crum of White-bread; or nointing with the aforeſaid Oyls, being laid on with unwaſht Wool; or with Oyntment of Marſh-mallows, as was ſaid before. And becauſe the part is not ſufficiently capable to receive the morbifick matter; to derive another way a portion thereof, a veficatory muſt be applied to the hinder part of the Neck, and alſo the Diaphore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick formerly cited muſt frequently be given. The Matter being called forth into the external parts, let Suppuration be endeavored, by laying on a Cataplaſm made of the Roots of Marſh-mallows, and of Lillies with Figs, Meal of Linſeeds, and the Oyls and ſeveral ſorts of Greaſe aforeſaid. When Suppuration is made, let the Tumor be opened; let the reſt of the Matter be digeſted, by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Cataplaſm, or by laying on a Plaiſter of Diachylon. Let the Ulcer be clenſed with that common Digeſtive made of Turpentine, Yolks of Egs and Oyl of Roſes. Let the Ulcer be kept long open with a Tent, that all the Venom of the Diſeaſe may ſufficiently be purged out, and at laſt heal it up and Cicatrize it. Yet this oue thing is to be obſerved; That if the Tumor doth ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe as to cauſe danger of Suffocation, or Choaking, it muſt be opened before it be perfectly ripe: For ſo ſome portion of the matter being drawn <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>orth, the Tumor will fall ſomwhat, and the danger of Suffocation will be avoided. In like manner, If the malignity be very intenſe, that the Patient ſeems likely to miſcarry before the Tumor be ripe; then alſo it muſt be opened before its due time that the force of the Venom may expire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whence oftentimes the Patient recovers. And upon this Account, in the Peſt the Buboes or ſwellings in the Groin, are wont to be opened, before they come to Suppuration.</p>
                        <p>Finally, It were a Wickedneſs to paſs over in ſilence a rare Experiment, which happened to me in that ſame Epidemick Feaver, which cruelly raged and ranged at <hi>Montpelier,</hi> in the year 1623. So that neer half of thoſe that were ſick died of the Diſeaſe. But eſpecially, So many as had ſwellings by the Ears (which was wont to happen about the ninth or eleventh day of the Diſeaſe) they al died within two daies after; there preceding or happening at the ſame time Raving, Stupidity, Convulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with an unequal, frequent, and very ſmall Pulſe, as it were the creeping Piſmire-Pulſe. And after I had ſeen divers in this condition, who could not be helpt by Antidotes, or by drawing things laid to the ſwelling; muſing with my ſelf it by any means poſſible, they might be delivered from ſo certain deſtruction: I began at laſt to think, that therefore theſe ſwellings proved to fatal, becauſe the Part in which they happened was not capable to receive all the Morbifick Matter, which being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained within kills the Patient, and that therefore the work of Nature being only begun in thoſe ſwellings, might be ſupplyed by evacuations, viz. Blood-letting, and purgation; whenas alſo <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> in his 3. <hi>de Comp. Medic. Secund. Loca. Cap. de Parotidibus,</hi> In the Cure of theſe ſwellings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes Blood-letting. But this advice was contradicted by the extream weakneſs of the Patients, which was ſo great that they ſeemed to be even now in the pains of death, which alſo it ſelf ſoon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. But <hi>Galen</hi> in the forecited place, when He preſcribes Blood-letting in the Cure of ſuch Tumors, does propound two conditions, viz. If blood abound, and the ſtrength of the Patient will bear bleeding. Both which Conditions were abſent in theſe Caſes, for blood had been before ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently drawn, both by repeated Phlebotomies, and Cupping-glaſſes: Alſo the Patients were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly decaied in their ſtrength. Weighing all theſe things with my ſelf, I conceived that golden ſaying of <hi>Cornelius Celſus,</hi> was in this Caſe if ever ſeaſonable, viz. <hi>That many things are done right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in time of eminent danger, which were otherwiſe to be omitted: And that its better to Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a doubtful Remedy in one or two perſons, than to leave ſo many perſons to undoubted Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> I was alſo encouraged by conceiving, that this great weakneſs of the Patients, was rather from oppreſſion of the Morbifick Matter, than diſſipation or diſſolution of their ſtrength. For there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their ſtrength did ſuddenly decay, becauſe Nature was not able to caſt off her heavy burthen, and I hoped when that burthen was made lighter, ſhe would be freed. Add hereunto, That blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:49088:285"/>
might be ſo ordered, that no danger ſhould be feared therfrom, viz. If two or three ounces only were taken away at firſt, for tryall ſake, and if the ſucceſs were good, a greater quantity might be taken away afterward I reſolved therefore upon this courſe. And a Merchant of <hi>Montpelier</hi> named <hi>Bernardier</hi> being the firſt I met with, and a tumor aroſe behind his left ear on the eleventh day of the diſeaſe with ſuch a puls &amp; other ſymptoms as aforeſaid; I preſcribed bleeding to the quantity of three ounces which the Chyrurgion being an Antient and experienced man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to do for fear the patient ſhould dy under his hands; afterwards being emboldened by my preſence &amp; authority he took away three ounces of Blood, after three or four houres, I viſit my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient again, &amp; find his puls a little ſtronger &amp; not ſo unequal; then I cauſed him to bleed ſix ounces, after which his puls was beter and ſtronger. The Blood was very corrupt: The day following I preſcribed him a Purg of Senna, Rhubarb and ſyrup of Roſes: and ſo the patient was recovered from the jaws of death. And afterwards all the ſick that had uſings behind their ears, firſt I Bled ſeverall times a little at a time, and the day following Purged them: and ſo all of them (to God be the Honor and Praiſe) ſo many as were thus ordered happily recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and never any afterwards that had thoſe riſings behind their ears, died in the whol year</p>
                        <p>Howb it it is to be noted (which we hinted in the prognoſis) that the ſwelling doth often appear critically and profitably, and thereby the ſick are recovered of their diſeaſes; viz, So oft as they appear in the declination of the diſeaſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this is eaſily ſeen by the abatement of the ſymptoms which follow upon the riſings; and ſuch are wont to happen in Feavers of leſs malignity But in the time aforeſaid. ſuch was the malignity of the epidemical Feaver<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the tumors behind the Ears would often break forth in the ſtate of the diſeaſe and ſymptomatically and deadly; until by the remedies aforeſaid, their o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>What is the difference between the Meaſles and ſmall Pox, Authors are not yet well agreed. But cuſtom hath obtained that thoſe ſame larger puſtles or Whelks like unto Warts (from whence

There is alſo another kind of puſtles common to Children like unto the ſmall Pox in reſpect of the faſhion and ſize; but herein it differs in that the ſmall Pox begins with redneſs and inflamation; but theſe are white and as it were bladderes full of a wheyiſh humor, which within three daies break and dry up and are wont to cauſe no danger, and commonly break forth without a Feaver. It is deſcribed by <hi>Vidus Vidius,</hi> in theſe words; <hi>Som beſiáes the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſorts do ad a third which they call the Cryſtalls,</hi> For ſo they term certain Bladdrs full of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which ſhine like Chriſtall, wherewith the Skin is in divers parts diapered; the common people call them <hi>Ravaglione.</hi> unto which all men are not ſo ſubject as unto the ſmall Pox and meaſles, neither are they ſo greviouſly afflicted under them. wherefore theſe bladders ought not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckoned as a third ſort with the ſmall Pox and Meaſles</p>
                        <p>Touching the ſmal Pocks, and Meaſles Authors diſpute much, and eſpecially whether theſe be new diſeaſes, or if they were known unto the antients, and what is the next and immediate Cauſe of them. But ſince I affect al poſſible brevity in my Lectures, I have bin wont to omit al controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, propounding onely the plain and naked deciſions of them; and accordingly, I ſhal breifly unfold what is to be thought of the foregoing queſtions.</p>
                        <p>And in the firſt place I conceive the ſmal Pocks and Meaſles to be no new diſeaſes, ſeeing they riſe from a moſt antient Cauſe, viz. the impurites of the maternal blood; which when the Arabians obſerved, they accounted it no new diſeaſe. But if they had firſt come abroad in their times, they would have mentioned their novelty. And although, they were the firſt that exactly deſcribed them; and <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> with the reſt of the Antients, have ſcarce mentioned them; we muſt ſuppoſe that therefore the Antients did not write diſtinctly of them, becauſe they are only accidents of a malignant Feaver and critical eruptions, which do not make a diſtinct diſeaſe by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Or becauſe in Greece through the mildneſs of the Ayr theſe diſeaſe were ſo light, as not to deſerve the Care of a Phyſitian. Even as in the Weſtern Indies, in regard of the great temperatnes of the Ayr, it was wont to be to be light, that it was ſcarce taken notice of before the coming of the Spaniards into thoſe parts. But a Blackmore which was brought thither, being taken with Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential ſmal Pocks, the malignant and venemous quality being ſpred by Inſection, the diſeaſe began ſo to range and rage, that a great part of the Indians were ſlain thereby. For whereas before, thoſe impurites of their Mothers blood remaining in them, were wont eaſily to be diſcuſſed, throught the Clemency of the Ayr; now when a venemous quality was added to them, they cauſed grevious Diſeaſes.</p>
                        <p>Now that the Mothers blood is the true Cauſe of the Smal Pocks and Meaſles, is hence cheifly gathered, becauſe among many thouſands of Men, it is hard to ſind one, who once in his Life hath not had theſe diſeaſes. But a diſeaſe common to al Men, muſt needs depend upon ſome common cauſe: ſuch as are the principles of Generation viz. the ſeed and Mothers blood.</p>
                        <p>But the ſeed cannot be the cauſe of the ſmal Pocks and Meaſles, becauſe from it come hereditary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, ſuch as laſt a Mans Life time; it remaines therefore that theſe diſeaſes ſpring from the Mothers blood, with which the Child is nouriſhed in the Womb. For therein, be it never ſo pure, ſome impurites are found, which communicate their pollution to the parts of the Child; and that pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the parts, doth defile the Maſs of blood; and being provoked by ſome occaſion, doth make the ſame to boil, by help whereof, the blood ferments and becomes purified, both it and the parts aforeſaid. This the <hi>Arabians</hi> do mannifeſt by a cleer example of Wine, which being powred whiles it is new into muſty or otherwiſe il-qualited Veſſel receives that il quality from the Veſſel but when it begins to work and pureſie, it clenſes both it ſelf and the Veſſel. Now this working doth commonly happen to Children; howbeit ſomtimes to thoſe that are elder and have attained Mans eſtate, becauſe it is evermore ſet on work by ſome external Cauſe, ſuch as is eſpecially a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain diſpoſition of ayr proportionable to this diſeaſe whence it comes to paſs that ſomtimes the ſmal Pocks, ſomtimes the Meaſles are riſe, becauſe the Ayr is ſomtimes enclined to the one and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the other.</p>
                        <p>Neither can thoſe impurites of the Mothers blood, infect her and cauſe in her the ſame diſeaſes, althought <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaies in his Book <hi>de Natura Pueri</hi> that there are three parts of the blood, one moſt pure, with which the Child is nouriſhed; another impure, wherewith the Mother is nouriſhed; and another, moſt impurer, which is kept in the Veins of the Womb, the whol time of Going with Child, and after the Birth is purged away in the Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed purgations. For firſt, ſeeing the Mother hath parts more hard and ſolid, they do not ſo ſoon take impreſion as the tender and ſoft body of the Child. Again that moſt impure part of the blood which is kept in the Veins of the womb and of the After-birth, the whol time of belly-bearing, doth infect the blood in the paſſage, which is carryed through thoſe parts to Nouriſh the Child: whence the Child contracts and evil quality, which in its time is the Cauſe of that ebullition in the blood of
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:49088:286"/>
the Child. But that impureſt part of the blood remaining in the foreſaid places, doth not infect the body of the Mother.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, its not to be wondered at, that the breaking out of the ſmal Pocks and Meaſles, is ſomtimes ſo long deferred, as that ſome have them at Mans eſtate. For thoſe impurites do not ſubſtantially remain in the body as many imagine: for they would be corrupted by long ſtay and acquire a moſt grevious putrefaction. But only an evil quality is by them imprinted upon the parts of the Child, which in proceſs of time infecting ſome part of the humors, becomes offenſive to Nature; which then rowſing her ſelf, doth drive thoſe infected portions of the humors, into the Skin.</p>
                        <p>And foraſmuch as in the Maſs of blood a twoſold excrement is found, the one thick the other thin: of the thick, the ſmal Pocks are bred, of the thin, the Meaſles. And although the evil and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant quality be one and the ſame, inſecting both excrements: yet becauſe the Nature of the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is different, the Analogy of the external Cauſe unto them both is Different. whence it comes to paſs that ſometimes the ſmal Pocks and ſomtimes the Meaſles are Epidemically ſpread abroad.</p>
                        <p>And although the ſmal Pocks are wont to break forth in the whol body, yet are they wont to appear in greateſt quantity in the face, feet and hands; which is otherwiſe in the purple ſpots of the Purple Feaver, for they appear moſt on the breaſt and back. The Cauſe of which difference is this, that inaſmuch as the ſmal Pocks ariſe from an ebullition of the blood, by help whereof an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion is made of the excrements lurking therein, unto the Skin; and the Liver being the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and original of blood, whoſe Emunctories are the Face, Hands, and Feet, whence it comes that ſuch as have hot Livers, have red and rubied faces, and feel intenſe heat in the palmes of their hands and Soals of their feet; it follows that the ſmal Pocks and Meaſles muſt come out there more than any where elſe. Contrarywiſe the purple ſpotts which appear in malignant Feavers, do ariſe principally from the Miſaffection of the Heart, and therfore they break out chiefly in parts near the Heart, and eſpecially about the Loines; becauſe in them the <hi>Vena Cava aſcendens and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria aorta</hi> which are annexed unto the Hair, have their Courſe,</p>
                        <p>Alſo another difference is to be noted between the ſmal Pocks and Purples; becauſe the ſmal Pocks and Meaſles appearing on the third or fourth day from the beginning of the Feaver, are wont to be critical, and for the moſt part void of danger: but the purple ſpots, though they appear on the ſeventh day are commonly Symptomatical, and render the diſeaſe worſe; whenas a man would think it ſhould be otherwiſe, for a diſeaſe is more crude on the fourth than the ſeveuth day. But the Cauſe of this difference conſiſts herein; that in the ſmal Pocks and Meaſles the Feaver commonly begins at the higheſt; ſo that not only on the third and fourth day, but alſo on the firſt or ſecond daies, excretions may be in them critical. But malignant Feavers proceed more ſlowly, and their beginning is commonly Extended to the ſeventh day: ſo that Excretions which then happen cannot be critical. Now that the Pox and Meaſles come ſo ſoon to their ſtate and not the malignant Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, is hence; becauſe the Pox and Meaſle-Feaver comes from the lighteſt putrefaction, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from an Ebullition of the blood than from any intenſe putrefaction of the matter; and therfore Nature by help of Coction makes it to ceaſe before the ſeventh day, becauſe it was a light Feaver and roſe from the ſlighteſt Cauſes. But in malignant Feavers, ſo great and fordid is the putrefaction that it cannot be corrected in the fourteenth nor ſomtimes in the twentieth day. And therefore the ſpotts breaking out before that time, the diſeaſe is exaſperated; becauſe Nature was forced to expel them, without Concoction and ſymptomatically.</p>
                        <p>The expulſion therefore of ſmal pox and Meaſles is cauſed, by an Ebullition of the blood: which Ebullition according to <hi>Avicennas doctrine,</hi> is twofold; the one perfective, the other corruptive. The perfective or depurative is that, in which only the impurer and excrementitious parts of the blood, are by Nature purged forth, that the whol maſs may afterward remain pure; and then the ſmal Pocks are innocent, which are cured without any help of Phyſick. But the corruptive is, wherein not onely the excrementitous parts of the blood, but the ſincere blood it ſelf is putrefied whence ariſe dangerous and deadly pox, and according as there is more or leſs putrefaction, in more in more or fewer parts of the blood, ſo is the danger more or leſs. This corruptive Ebullition doth cheifly happen, when thoſe diſeaſes are epidemical being occaſioned by a malignant Conſtitution of the Air, by which an ebullition of the humors and a malignant putrefaction is cauſed; whonce many and dangerous ſmal Pocks are cauſed; which are ſomtimes (according to <hi>Rhaſis</hi>) the Forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Plague.</p>
                        <p>Pocks and Meaſles are reckoned among acute diſeaſes becauſe ordinarily they are terminated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſpace of fourteen daies. Now ſom do wittily obſerve a double order of times in times in this diſeaſe viz. the time of ebullition and the time of eruption: the time of ebullition is commonly terminated in four daies; ſo that the firſt day is counted the beginning, the ſecond the Augment, the third the ſtate, and the fourth the declination: for then the Feaver and other ſymptomes are wont to remit.</p>
                        <p>But the beginning of the Eruption of the Pox is the fourth day it ſelf, the Augment reaches to
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:49088:287"/>
the ſeventh, the ſtate until the eleventh, the declination unto the fourteenth, at which time the Pocks are dried. Howbeit oftentimes they are not dry until the twentieth day.</p>
                        <p>Differences of ſinall Pocks and Meaſles, are taken either from the ſubſtance, in regard of which, ſome are more or leſs Flegmatick, Bloody, Chollerick, or Melanchollick: or from the Quantity, in which regard they are more or leſs in number; greater or leſs; profound or Superficial; or from the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, in which reſpect ſome are red, others white, yellowiſh, Violet colored, Livid, black, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the diverſity of Humors of which they are compounded; or from the time, in reſpect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſome come quickly out, others ſlowly; ſome are ſoon, others late ripe, or diſſolved: or from the place, in which reſpect, ſome occupy only the Skin. others do ſeaz upon the internal Parts alſo, as the Throat, Lungs, Guts, Liver, Spleen, and other bowels.</p>
                        <p>The Diagnoſis reſpects either the Diſeaſe preſent or at hand. The ſmal Pocks and Meaſles, when they are preſent, are ſubject to the outward Sences, and need therefore no other ſigns. But theſe ſigns following declare them to be at hand.</p>
                        <p>Pain in the Head with Pulſation in the Forehead, and Temples; great Sleepineſs: Terrors in Sleep; ſometimes Ravings, Tremblings and Convulſions: Sneezings; frequent Yawning; Hoarſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Cough, Difficulty in breathing. Heat, Redneſs, and Sence of pricking over the whol body. Pain of the back which comes ſometimes alone, or appearing with few other Symptoms in a Synor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus Feaver, it ſhews the ſmal Pocks will come out. For ſeeing through the back are carried the great Vein and Artery, in which the malignant blood boiling, does ſend forth ſharp vapors to the Nerves, and neighboring Membranes; it muſt needs be, that pains ſhould be felt eſpecially in thoſe parts. Great Anxiety and unquietnels. Tears flowing of themſelves. Shining before the Eyes, and their Itching, a ſwelling of the Face with ſome Redneſs. A vehemency of the Symptoms at firſt, ſo that the Diſeaſe ſeems of a ſudden to have attained its vigor.</p>
                        <p>All which are cauſed, eather by many and thick vapors ſent up by the boiling of the blood, into the Head, Diaphragm, and other parts; or from the Nature of the Pocks themſelves, now beginning to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade, the parts; or by a Fluxion cauſed by heat, which diſſolves the Humors in the Brain.</p>
                        <p>It's of great Moment to foreſee the ſmal Pox; but much more to foretel their event, which the following Prognoſtick Signs wil declare.</p>
                        <p>And in the firſt place thoſe ſmal Pox are wont to be void of danger, which come out ſoon and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily, and do quickly ripen.</p>
                        <p>In which the Feaver is moderate, without great Symptomes, which ceaſes after they are come out or is very much abated. In which the voyce is free and breathing eaſie.</p>
                        <p>Smal Pox, which at firſt are red, and white, ſoft, diſtinct, few, round, pointed, coming only in the Skin and not inwardly, are wont to be ſafe.</p>
                        <p>All the Signs aforeſaid do ſignifie the paucity of the Morbifick Matter, it's Obſequiousneſs, Benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and the ſtrength of Nature, luſtily expelling.</p>
                        <p>Contrary wiſe dangerous and deadly Pox are known, by a great Feaver, which leſſens not after they are broak forth; for it ſignifies the malignant and venemous humors are not ſufficienly expelled unto the Skin, but that the greateſt part of them remains yet in the Veins. Great anxiety and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſs; which comes from the ſame humors boiling in the Veins. Difficulty of breathing, which ſignifies either puſtles or Impoſtumes in the Lungs; or a Squinſie, or great decay of ſtrength. Great thirſt which declares the inward burning; and if with the thirſt, ſhortneſs of breath be encreaſed, Death is at hand. A Looſneſs or bloody Flux, which ſhews the malignant humors have their recourſe inward, which is a courſe quite contrary to that of Nature and therefore deadly, ſo that few of thoſe which after the Pox coming out, are taken with ſuch a Looſneſs do eſcape.</p>
                        <p>A Bloodie Urine is a moſt deadly ſign; and likewiſe if by ſtool pure and ſincere blood be voided. Somtimes alſo by the Noſtrils, Gums, and other parts of the body blood is voided, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly deadly Signs. For they ſignifie the extream Acrimony and malignity of the blood: which doth vehemently provoke Nature, and compells her to a prepoſterous excretion thereof.</p>
                        <p>Alſo Pox long a coming out are very bad, which ſignifie the contumacy of the matter, or the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Nature, Many, Great, Double and united Pox, do ſhew an overabundant quantity of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bifick matter, and are bad. So are hard ones ſhewing the thickneſs and incoctibility of the ſaid mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Alſo flatt ones which ſhew the weakneſs of the expulſive faculty, and they are worſe, if they have a black ſpot in the middles of them, which argues extraordinary malignity. And green, blewiſh and black which ſpring from that ſort of choller called <hi>Bilis porraca, or Atra</hi> Leeke-green or black Chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler are a bad ſign.</p>
                        <p>They are worſt of al which when they are come forth do preſently vaniſh, and the tumor of the parts falls: for they ſignifie the retirement of the Humor inwards; and none of thoſe eſcape who have the Pox on this manner going in again, but they die commonly within twenty four houres.</p>
                        <p>They are alſo dangerous, when ſports like thoſe of the purple or ſpotted Feaver, are mingled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the pox; eſpecially if thoſe ſpots be livid or black. For they ſignifie not only that ſame
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:49088:287"/>
light putrefaction, which is wont to happen in the ſmall Pox by means of the ebullition of blood: but alſo that intenſe and profound Malignity is peccant; from which much greater danger is threatened to the Patient.</p>
                        <p>Dung or Urines in this Diſeaſe livid or black do portend great danger: for they ſignifie that Melancholly abounds in the Veins, and infects the whol Maſs of Blood.</p>
                        <p>The cure of the ſmall Pox &amp; Meaſles is performed in the ſatisfaction of four Indications. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the firſt conſiſts in the Evacuation of the peccant humors. The ſecond in aſſiſting the motion of nature, or helping to expell the Pox. The third in the oppoſition of the malignant and venemous quality. The fourth in correction of ſymptoms. All which that they may be conveniently effected, firſt a convenient diet muſt be appointed, which muſt be the ſame which was ordered in the cure of putrid Feavers: howbeit ſome things muſt be particularly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                        <p>Firſt that the patients be kept in a warm room, to the end their pores may be kept open, &amp; the breaking out of the ſmal Pox may there be furthered. therefore they muſt be kept in a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber well ſhut, which the cold air muſt in no wiſe enter into. For many Children that had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigne Pox, have been killed by letting in the cold ayr upon them, viz. the morbifick matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby driven back into the inward parts. And for the ſame cauſe they muſt be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately covered with Cloathes; but ſo that the heat of the air or the weight of the Cloathes may not augment the heat of the Feaver, The foreſaid coverings are wont commonly to be made of red cloaths, becauſe they are thought by ſom Analogy to move the boiling blood to the externall parts. Many are alſo wont to keep an Ewe or Wether in the chamber or on the bed; becauſe thoſe Creatures are eaſily infected and draw the venom to themſelves, by which meanes ſom Eaſe may happen to the ſick perſons.</p>
                        <p>A decoction of Barly, or of the roots of Sorrel, or of Harts horn is profitably uſed for drink, in the beginning of the diſeaſe eſpecially, and when the Feaver is vehement. But if the Feaver be not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> very violent, a decoction of Barly and Figs wil be very profitable, viz. Effectually driving the Humors to the Skin; and <hi>Foreſtus</hi> and <hi>Amatus</hi> did continually uſe the ſame with good ſucceſs.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, Whereas in the whol Courſe of the Diſeaſe, Sleep ought to be moderate, yet in the Augment when the Pocks break forth, long Sleep is hurtful, and it is better to watch more than ordinary.</p>
                        <p>That therefore the aforeſaid Jndications may be fulfilled, the Cure muſt be begun by Blood-let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting (if Blood in any ſort is redundant, and the Age of the Patient is like to bear it) and a Vein muſt be opened as ſoon as may be. But if the Phyſitian ſhall not be called the firſt day, yet he ſhal do well to take blood before the breaking forth of the Pocks or while but few are come out; which time is wont commonly to laſt until the fourth day, from the firſt onſet of the Feaver. In which Caſe notwithſtanding, diligent heed is to be taken. For if upon the breaking forth of the Pocks, the Feaver and its Symptoms be abated; it is better to leave the buſineſs to Nature wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king well, which will ſufficiently expel the whol Morbifick Matter to the Skin. Alſo Blood-let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not in this caſe neceſſary, ſince experience ſhews, that an infinite company of children haveing gentle Pox, and not Plethorick are happily cured without bleeding. Nay rather in the former caſe ſomtimes blood-letting may do hurt, becauſe the expulſion of the ſmal Pox is cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an ebullition of blood: which ebullition if it be ſmall, it will by blood-letting be leſſened very much, and ſo it will becom inſufficient perfectly to purge the maſs of Blood from it's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities. Contrarywiſe, if upon the Eruption of the Pox, the Feaver becomes more ſtrong, there be anxiety, difficult breathing, an urin thick and red, and other ſymptoms ſeem greater it's a ſign that naure is oppreſt, with the over great burthen of humors, and that ſhe cannot govern them conveniently; and that therefore Phlebotomy is neceſſary, that a part of the burthen being taken away, nature may be the better able to expel the reſt. In one word, when there is an Ebullition perfective meerly and depuratiue, blood is not to be taken away, but in a corruptive blood-letting is extreamly neceſſary yea even in that which hath leſs malignity in it, whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees have been ſpecefied before, And ſo neceſſary is blood-letting in dangerous Pox, in which the corruptive Ebullition is wont to happen, that the tender age of infants muſt not hinder it. For it is grown into a cuſtom to let children blood when they are four years old and ſomtimes when they are three. The phyſitians of <hi>Paris</hi> in their tender age and while they ſuck do let children blood. Which yet the tender age of infants doth hardly admit, with that light nouriſhment of milk, and the plentifull efflux of their humors by tranſpiration; neither can this new licence of letting ſuch yong ones blood be juſtified by any countenance from the wiſe Authors <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>In prety big children, many times once blood-letting wil not ſerve the turn, but it muſt be repeated
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:49088:288"/>
if the Feaver remain intenſe or if Raving or any other grevious Symptome do urge, Yea verily when the Pox are perfectly come out, which for the moſt part is within nine daies, if the Feaver be very urgent, blood muſt be again let and the Patients ordered, as thoſe who have a putrid Feaver.</p>
                        <p>If blood-letting be ſuſpected becauſe of the tendernes of the Childrens Age, or becauſe the fitting ſeaſon is now paſt; the ſuperfluous blood may be diminiſhed by Cupping-Glaſſes with Scarifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, applied to the back, ſhoulders, and things, which may alſo wel be uſed in the ſtate of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, ſeeing the Motion of Nature from the Centre to the Circumference, is by them promoted. But care muſt be taken that in young Children the Scarifications be not too deep: for it happens ſomtimes that an unadviſed Surgeon cutts ſo deep, as to cut aſunder ſome Veins and let out the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent and boiling blood, ſo that there is great trouble to ſtop the ſame.</p>
                        <p>Purgation is ſuſpected in this diſeaſe; for it makes a motion contrary to that of Nature viz. from the Circumference to the Centre; and to whomſoever, having Pocks, a looſneſs happens, the Pocks commonly ſtrik in, and the Partie dies, as I ſaid in the Prognoſtick. Yet obſerve, that many times purgation is to good purpoſe practiſed before the pocks come out, and before the Feaver growes vehement, viz. when the Children are in the Neutral ſtate of Decidence. For then if il humors abound, they are profitably diminiſhed by purging, that Nature may afterward, more Cheerfully ſet upon the Expulſion of the Remainder. But when the Pox begins to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, Purging wil be pernicious: And likewiſe, if there be great malignity abroad, as in an epidemical Conſtitution, when very many Children dy of that diſeaſe; it is better wholly to abſtain from Purging; becauſe in diſeaſes which are very malignant and Peſtilential, Purgation in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Diſeaſe, is very hurtful. Now the Purgatives muſt be compounded of gentle Simples viz. Rhubarb, Caſſia, Manna, Tamarinds, and Syrup of Roſes.</p>
                        <p>In the Courſe of the diſeaſe, if the belly be hard and bound it may gently be removed, but not provoked; and that by a ſuppoſitory of honey alone without ſalt; or with a Cliſter of Breath or milk, or a decoction of French barley, Raiſons and Liquoris with ſugar and yolkes of Eggs.</p>
                        <p>After blood-letting and other evacuations (if neceſſary) the expulſion of the pox muſt be helped forward, not only with ſpecifick medicines driving the humors to the Skin, but alſo with diapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks and Alexipharmicks; eſpecially if the Pox be Epidemical and being very malignant, do threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten great danger.</p>
                        <p>There is a vulgar Medicine commended by <hi>Rhaſis, Avicenna</hi> and al the Arabian Phyſitians to drive out the Pox; which alſo the greateſt part of our later Phyſitians uſe, according to the deſcription of Avicenna, which is thus.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Fat figgs ſeven ounces. Lentills ſhaled three drams. Lack two drams and an half. Gum traganth and fennel ſeed, of each two drams. Boil al in a pint and half of fountain water to the third part. Let the patient drink thereof. Rhaſis adds Saffron fifteen grains, Raiſons five drams, becauſe Saffron opens and corroborates, and the Raiſons do ſtrengthen the Liver. And Traganth although it do incraſſate and aſtringe, yet is it therefore mingled with the reſt, that it may prohibit the over great ebullition of blood.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Lentils are by ſome Neotericks rejected, becauſe they are reſtrictive and may hinder the coming forth of the Pox. But the Autority of ſo many and ſuch noble Princes of Phyſick, muſt not raſhly be rejected; but we muſt rather determine, that Lentils ſhaled are with great reaſon put into this compoſition; viz. that by their aſtringent and incraſſating faculty, they may bridle the Fervency of the humors and hinder their falling upon any noble part; to which purpoſe Gum traganth was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as I hinted before. This is taken out of <hi>Galen,</hi> who in the 1. <hi>De Aliment. Facult. Cap.</hi> 18. Doth teach us that Lentils twice boiled do Strengthen the Natural parts, and by their aſtriction ſtop the flux of the belly. The Lentils may therfore be put in or left out according to the Judgment of the Phyſitian who manages the Cure as there is more or leſs neceſſity of attenuating and driving the humors into the Skin. For if the matter be ſubtile and the ebullition great, the Lentils may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably be put in for the Intent aforeſaid. But if the matter ſeem to be thick, ſo that Nature can but ſlowly drive it into the Skin then muſt they be omitted and the Gum traganth; and onely the other attenuating and diaphoretick things uſed for the drink. By which it appears, that we muſt not too ſtrictly adhere to the formes of Medicaments propounded by Authors; but that in ſeveral occaſions they muſt be variouſly changed. Let this following Receipt ſerve for an example, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded partly of the foreſaid ſimples and partly of others that are diaphoretick and reſiſt malignity; which may much help ſuch as have this diſeaſe, in making the Pox to come wel out.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Rootes of Fennel and Sorrel of each one ounce. Harts-horn ſhavings half an ounce Leaves of Scabious, Scordium, St. Johns-wort of each one Handful. Three pair of fat Figgs. Gum Lack three drams. ſeeds of Navew or Turnep &amp; Carduus Benedictus of each two drams. Lentils unhusked half an ounce. Gum traganth one dram and an half. Boil al to a pint and half. Of the ſtraining take three ounces. Syrup of Lemmons one ounce. Mix them. make of them a Julep let the Patient drink thereof twice or thrice in a day.</hi>

For ſomtimes they break forth ſo violently, that they have need to be reſtrained for a while. For the great ebullition and immoderate Fervor of blood, if they be not tempered. are wont to deſtroy the Patients; and therfore, it is good in ſuch a Caſe to uſe bridlers and coolers, For example, a Julep many be thus compoſed.</p>

                           <hi>Amatus Luſitanus</hi> in the 18. Cure of the third Centurie propounds an example of ſuch kind of Pox ariſing from boiling humors and cured only by coolers and thickeners. which example I thought good to cite in this place word for word, that the young beginners may perceive, in what caſes the Cure is moſt to be yaried. <hi>The Boy of</hi> Altaraſius (ſaies he) <hi>began to have the ſmal Pox, ſome of which did run together, ſo that in two daies they flaid his Miſerable Carcaſe: for the puſtles crept along and did only flay oſf his Skin; which I have likewiſe obſerved in other Children. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which, I thus ſet my ſelf to work; Firſt becauſe this matter was too thin, I endeavored to thicken the ſame, and not only ſo, but to abate the evil quality of the Liver and internal parts, that no more ſuch thin ſubtile Humor might be bred. This I did with refrigerating Medicaments, as Syrup of Roſes, of Cichory ſimple, of Endive and Violets with waters of like Nature mixed with them. He was nointed with Ceratum Santalinum. But the Diet likwiſe helped much, which was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered cold and moiſt. By al which the matter became thicker and the pox began to appear thick and large.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And for ordinary drink preſcribe a decoction of barly and of Sorrel roots. And theſe remedies muſt be continued, until the Fervency of the humors ſhal begin to abate: if Nature ſeem to want their aſſiſtance.</p>
                        <p>Theſe things might ſuffice for a direct Cure of the ſmal Pox. But becauſe they may bring great dammage to divers parts, both internal and external, we muſt endavour the Prevention and Cure thereof.</p>
                        <p>The internal parts may eſpecially be preſerved with a decoction of Lentils, of Gum Lac and Traganth, deſcribed before. For Gum Lack defends the Liver and Spleen, Lentils the Gutts, and Traganth the breaſt.</p>

But if a preſent Looſens, or dyſenterie be urgent, firſt detergent and lenitive Remedies muſt be uſed and afterwards aſtringents. And ſo Clyſters muſt be made of calybeated Milk, of Sugar and yolkes of Eggs: and afterwards of a decoction of barly and red Roſes with the yolk of an egg; and laſt of al, of a decoction of Plantaine, Knot-graſs, and Prunella or Self-heal, and other Simples ſet down in our Cure of the Diſentery. And it is to be obſerved, that a looſneſs in children that have Pox, is oftentimes cauſed by wormes, which laſts dureing the whol diſeaſe, whence they are in the danger of Death; becauſe the expulſion of the Pox is therby hindred wholly or leſſened. Which is eaſily known by the thickneſs and viſcoſitie of the excrements, and their grey or whitiſh color: then muſt be adminiſtred ſuch things as kill Worms: and ſweet Clyſters muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</p>
                        <p>Somtimes alſo the kidneys are affected and are exulcerated, whence ariſes Piſſing of Blood. In this Caſe it is good to give an emulſion of the four greater cool ſeeds, with trochiſcs of Alkekengy, de Carabe, and other things ſet down in our chapters of Piſſing of Blood.</p>
                        <p>Among external parts, the Eyes are moſt of all to be guarded from the ſmal Pox. For being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with a ſoft and humid ſubſtance; the matter of the Pox is eaſily driven unto them: whence ariſe grevious calamites and ſomtimes total Blindneſs.</p>
                        <p>Before the Pox break out therefore, or when they begin to appear, the Eyes muſt be anointed every hour with Plantane and Roſe waters, in which a little ſaffron is diſſolved; or with the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eye-Salve, which doth more effectually preſerve them.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>water of Roſes and Plantane, of each one ounce and half. Pouder of Sumach ſeeds two drams.

                        </p>
                        <p>It wil be yet more effectual, if Inſtead of the waters, the juices of knot-graſs and Sheperds-pouch be mingled with the reſt.</p>
                        <p>And if ſome Pox begin to Peep out of the Eye it ſelf, pidgeons blood muſt be often dropt in, that their reſolution may be haſtened. then alſo this following Eye-water is to be uſed.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Red Roſe water two ounces. Eye-bright water half an ounce trochiſci</hi> albi Rhaſis <hi>one dram. Tutty prepared one Scruple. Champhire five graines. Saffron two graines. make al into an Eye-water and wet the Eyes often therewith, with a thin linnen rag.</hi>

                        <p>To preſerve the Noſtrills, they muſt often ſmel to Vinegar. But a Collyrium of juyce of knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graſs, and ſhepherds pouch, Sumach ſeeds and camphire formerly prayſed, wil work more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; let the tent be often moiſtened therein, and put up into the Noſtrills. If notwithſtanding, the Pox do grow within the Noſe, they quickly become hard Scabs, which are often to be nointed with Oyl of ſweet almonds, that they may the ſooner fal off. And finally if an Ulcer happen in the Noſe, it muſt be dreſſed with a liniment of the Oyl of Eg-yolkes and juyce of Plantane, ſtirred together in a leaden Mortar.</p>

                           <pb n="64" facs="tcp:49088:289"/>To preſerve the Face, ſome waſh it with Roſe-water and other Aſtringents. Which I cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of: for a great part of the impurities flows unto the Face. For the Skin tthereof long looſe and ſoft, is very fit to receive Excrements. Wherefore if thoſe impurities which Nature ſends hither, be repelled, being retained within they may cauſe great hurt; and therefore the motion of Nature is no waies to be hindred. But this ought to be the Phyſitians care, to hinder that the Pocks which break out in the Face, do not leave behind them pits and Scarrs, which doth often deform the Countenance. And this he ſhall in good meaſure perform, if when the Pocks are ripe, and are high and white in the middle (which is wont to fall out upon the ninth day of the Diſeaſe) he cauſe them to be nointed with a Fether twice a day with Oyl of ſweet Almonds, drawn without fire, until the Cruſts fall off, For by this Medicine the Acrimony of Choller is tempered, the ripening of the Pocks is haſtened, and the falling off of the Cruſts furthered; which otherwiſe ſticking faſt, doth exulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Skin more deeply, by reaſon of the Quittor which lies under them. Oyl of Nuts new drawn without fire, mixed well with a like quantity of Roſe-water, till they come to the form of a Liniment, is excellent for the ſame purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>If by neglecting the Remedies aforeſaid, or through the extream malignity of the Humor, there remain Pits and Pock-holes, all diligence muſt be uſed to repair the ſame. Which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is extream hard to do perfectly; although many have taken great pains thereabout to gratifie Virgins, and other Women, who are exceeding careful to preſerve their Beauties. Among infinite Medicines recorded by Authors to this intent, I ſhall propound the choiſeſt.</p>
                        <p>And in the firſt place, Oyl of Eg-yolks does nouriſh and engender Skin, and therefore is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to fill the Pock-holes.</p>
                        <p>Wethers Suet freſh and new, melted and done out with a Fether, is effectual to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>But the filthyneſs of Pock-holes is much amended, if they be waſhed firſt with Yarrow-Water, or Cows-dung-water, diſtilled in <hi>May,</hi> and then anointed with Mans-Greaſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Foreſtus</hi> does much magnifie this following Oyntment.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Oyls of ſweet Almonds and white Lillies, of each one ounce: Fat of a Capon three drams: Pouder of Peony Roots, of Orice and Lytharge of Gold, of each ten grains: Sugar-Candy one ſcruple. Mingle al well in a warm Mortar, ſtrain them through a Cloth, and noint the Pock-holes therewith morning and night. And afterwards let them be well waſhed with Water diſtilled out of Calves-feet: and when that is not at hand, uſe the Water of Yarrow in ſtead thereof.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Neither muſt I omit that which many Practitioners do teach, viz. That when the Pocks be ripe, they muſt be bored through with a golden or a ſilver Needle, leaſt the Quittor tarrying long in them, ſhould leave holes in the part. Which Practice, is notwithſtanding, now in a manner grown out of uſe, ſince Experience has taught, that the Pocks being bored are longer in healing and doth longer hold their Cruſts, becauſe of the Weakneſs of Natural Heat, cauſed in the Part by boring, whereby more deformed Scars are left behind. And therefore it is better to abſtain from this boring, and to commit the evacuation of the Quittor to Nature alone.</p>
                        <p>To conclude this Cure, I ſhall ſubjoyn how thoſe diſpoſitions of Itching and Exulceration which happen to perſons that have the ſmall Pocks, may be remedied.</p>
                        <p>And in the firſt place, When the ſmall Pocks come forth, or when they begin to ripen, ſomtimes an huge pain or Itching does afflict the Patients; eſpecially in the Palms of the Hands and Soales of the Feet, becauſe the thickneſs of the Skin in thoſe parts hinders the Eruption of the Pocks.</p>
                        <p>Which Symptom you ſhall help, if you cauſe thoſe parts to be held in hot Water, or Foment them a long time with an Emollient Decoction. But when there is great Itching in the Face, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels the Patients to ſcratch, whence great deformity and foul Scars follow; uſe this following Remedy.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>leaves of Pellitory of the Wall one handful: Flowers of Chamomel and Melilote, of each half a pugil. Boil them in a pint of Scabious Water, To the ſtrained Liquor ad three ounces of Honey-ſuckle Water. With this Liquor hot, often let the Itching Pocks be moiſtened, by dipping a thin Rag or Cotton Wool therein, and ſo applying the Liquor gently to them.</hi>

               <label>The Vertues are as follow:</label>
            </p>
            <p>IT Cures all Agues, whether Quotidian, Tertian, or Quartan: as alſo it cured divers people of that moſt horrid putrid Feaver, which ſo violently ſeized on mens Bodies (both before and after <hi>Michaelmas</hi> 1653.) to the great admiration of many; and when the parties Diſeaſed have ben both ſenceleſs and ſpeechleſs, for that neither that, nor any other Medicine or <hi>Panacaea,</hi> though never ſo gentle, could ſafely be adminiſtred into the Body, it hath beyond all hopes, by external application on the ſtomack revived them. It cures the Gout of all ſorts perfectly being adminiſtred as the Phyſitian ſhal adviſe. It cauſeth Women ſubject to Abortion, or Miſcarriage, to goe their time: and yet being given when the time comes it cauſeth a ſpeedy and eaſie delivery. It is an infallible cure for the French Pox and doth it with ſuch eaſe, ſpeed, and Secretneſs, that none of the neareſt relation ſhal take notice thereof. It cures the Green-ſickneſs and all ſorts of Jaundice, It provokes the Terms. It is good for Aches and all afflictions coming of cold. It helps the Rickets. But to what purpoſe do I nominate diſeaſes in particular, when it is an univerſall Remedy for all diſeaſes being adminiſtred as the Phyſitian ſhal adviſe? For its chief aim is exhila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the vital ſpirits and heart. It both binds and ſtops Fluxes, yet Purges; it both Vomits, and ſtays Vomiting; it cauſes Sweat, yet cures preternatural Sweatings and performs all its opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as Nature it ſelf would, have it, becauſe it only fortifies her in her Centre.</p>
            <p>To conclude, It is an Univerſal Fortification for all Complexions and ages, againſt all ſorts and degrees of Peſtilential and contagious Infection, both preventing before their poſſeſſion, and extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating of them after it.</p>
